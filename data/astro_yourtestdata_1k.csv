0,"In a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe, we investigate a unified cosmic fluid scenario endowed with bulk viscosity in which the coefficient of the bulk viscosity has a power law evolution. The power law in the bulk viscous coefficient is a general case in this study which naturally includes several choices as special cases. Considering such a general bulk viscous scenario, in the present work we have extracted the observational constraints using the latest cosmological datasets and examine their behaviour at the level of both background and perturbations. From the observational analyses, we find that a non-zero bulk viscous coefficient is always favored and some of the models in this series are able to weaken the current tension on $H_0$ for some dataset. At the level of perturbations, the models are very much sensitive to their free parameters. We find that the matter power spectra show an unusual blowing up for sufficient strength of the bulk viscous coefficient.","Weiqiang Yang, Supriya Pan, Eleonora Di Valentino, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Jianbo Lu","17 pages, 15 captioned figures, 5 tables; comments are welcome",1906.04162v1,No journal ref found,Jianbo Lu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04162v1,2019-06-10 17:58:53+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Challenging bulk viscous unified scenarios with cosmological   observations,2019-06-10 17:58:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04162v1
1,"We discuss the ability of a dark fluid becoming relevant around the time of matter radiation equality to significantly relieve the tension between local measurements of the Hubble constant and CMB inference, within the $\Lambda$CDM model. We show the gravitational impact of acoustic oscillations in the dark fluid balance the effects on the CMB and result in an improved fit to CMB measurements themselves while simultaneously raising the Hubble constant. The required balance favors a model where the fluid is a scalar field that converts its potential to kinetic energy around matter radiation equality which then quickly redshifts away. We derive the requirements on the potential for this conversion mechanism and find that a simple canonical scalar with two free parameters for its local slope and amplitude robustly improves the fit to the combined data by $\Delta\chi^2 \approx 12.7$ over $\Lambda$CDM. We uncover the CMB polarization signatures that can definitively test this scenario with future data.","Meng-Xiang Lin, Giampaolo Benevento, Wayne Hu, Marco Raveri","v2: added comments on $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{1/2}$; added more

2,"The Gaia Sausage is the major accretion event that built the stellar halo of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, we provide dynamical and chemical evidence for a second substantial accretion episode, distinct from the Gaia Sausage. The Sequoia Event provided the bulk of the high energy retrograde stars in the stellar halo, as well as the recently discovered globular cluster FSR 1758. There are up to 6 further globular clusters, including $\omega$~Centauri, as well as many of the retrograde substructures in Myeong et al. (2018), associated with the progenitor dwarf galaxy, named the Sequoia. The stellar mass in the Sequoia galaxy is $\sim 5 \times 10^{7} M_\odot$, whilst the total mass is $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, as judged from abundance matching or from the total sum of the globular cluster mass. Although clearly less massive than the Sausage, the Sequoia has a distinct chemo-dynamical signature. The strongly retrograde Sequoia stars have a typical eccentricity of $\sim0.6$, whereas the Sausage stars have no clear net rotation and move on predominantly radial orbits. On average, the Sequoia stars have lower metallicity by $\sim 0.3$ dex and higher abundance ratios as compared to the Sausage. We conjecture that the Sausage and the Sequoia galaxies may have been associated and accreted at a comparable epoch.","G. C. Myeong, E. Vasiliev, G. Iorio, N. W. Evans, V.

3,"We describe a blind uniform search for thermonuclear burst oscillations (TBOs) in the majority of Type-I bursts observed by RXTE (2118 bursts from 57 neutron stars). We examined 2-2002 Hz power spectra from the Fourier transform in sliding 0.5-2 s windows, using fine-binned light curves in 2-60 keV energy range. The significance of the oscillation candidates was assessed by simulations which took into account light curve variations, dead time and sliding time windows. Some of our sources exhibited multi-frequency variability below approximately 15 Hz that cannot be readily removed with light-curve modeling and may have an astrophysical (non-TBO) nature. Overall, we found that the number and strength of potential candidates depends strongly on the parameters of the search. We found candidates from all previously known RXTE TBO sources, with pulsations that had been detected at similar frequencies in multiple independent time windows, and discovered TBOs from SAX J1810.8-2658. We could not confirm most previously-reported tentative TBO detections or identify any obvious candidates just below the detection threshold at similar frequencies in multiple bursts. We computed fractional amplitudes of all TBO candidates and placed upper limits on non-detections. Finally, for a few sources we noted small excess of candidates with powers comparable to fainter TBOs, but appearing in single independent time bins at random frequencies. At least some of these candidates may be noise spikes that appear interesting due to selection effects. The potential presence of such candidates calls for extra caution if claiming single-bin TBO detections.","Anna V. Bilous, Anna L. Watts","Replaced to match the accepted version.

4,"Recent years have seen the introduction of various multi-field inflationary scenarios, in which the curvature and geodesics of the scalar manifold play a crucial role. We outline a simple description that unifies these different proposals and discuss their stability criteria. We demonstrate how the underlying dynamics is governed by an effective potential, whose critical points and bifurcations determine the late-time behaviour of the system, thus unifying hyperinflation, angular, orbital and side-tracked inflation. Interestingly, hyperinflation is shown to be a special case of side-tracked inflation. This equivalence relies on the enhanced isometries of the hyperbolic manifold and we provide the explicit coordinate transformation that maps the two models into each other.","Perseas Christodoulidis, Diederik Roest, Evangelos I.

5,"Bayesian analysis of the radiative capture reactions $^3\mathrm{He}(\alpha,\gamma)^7\mathrm{Be}$ and $^3\mathrm{H}(\alpha,\gamma)^7\mathrm{Li}$ are performed to draw inferences about the cross sections at threshold. We do a model comparison of two competing effective field theory power countings for the capture reactions. The two power countings differ in the contribution of two-body electromagnetic currents. In one power counting, two-body currents contribute at leading order, and in the other they contribute at higher orders. The former is favored for $^3\mathrm{He}(\alpha,\gamma)^7\mathrm{Be}$ if elastic scattering data in the incoming channel is considered in the analysis. Without constraints from elastic scattering data, both the power countings are equally favored. For $^3\mathrm{H}(\alpha,\gamma)^7\mathrm{Li}$, the first power counting with two-body current contributions at leading order is favored with or without constraints from elastic scattering data.","Pradeepa Premarathna, Gautam Rupak","11 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables",1906.04143v1,No journal ref found,Gautam Rupak,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04143v1,2019-06-10 17:30:48+00:00,nucl-th,nucl-th|astro-ph.SR,"Bayesian analysis of capture reactions   $^3\mathrm{He}(α,γ)^7\mathrm{Be}$ and   $^3\mathrm{H}(α,γ)^7\mathrm{Li}$",2019-06-10 17:30:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04143v1
6,"The habitable zone (HZ) is commonly defined as the range of distances from a host star within which liquid water, a key requirement for life, may exist on a planet's surface. Substantially more CO2 than present in Earth's modern atmosphere is required to maintain clement temperatures for most of the HZ, with several bars required at the outer edge. However, most complex aerobic life on Earth is limited by CO2 concentrations of just fractions of a bar. At the same time, most exoplanets in the traditional HZ reside in proximity to M dwarfs, which are more numerous than Sun-like G dwarfs but are predicted to promote greater abundances of gases that can be toxic in the atmospheres of orbiting planets, such as carbon monoxide (CO). Here we show that the HZ for complex aerobic life is likely limited relative to that for microbial life. We use a 1D radiative-convective climate and photochemical models to circumscribe a Habitable Zone for Complex Life (HZCL) based on known toxicity limits for a range of organisms as a proof of concept. We find that for CO2 tolerances of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 bar, the HZCL is only 21%, 32%, and 50% as wide as the conventional HZ for a Sun-like star, and that CO concentrations may limit some complex life throughout the entire HZ of the coolest M dwarfs. These results cast new light on the likely distribution of complex life in the universe and have important ramifications for the search for exoplanet biosignatures and technosignatures.","Edward W.

7,"We demonstrate a method to systematically obtain eigenvalues and eigenstates of a many-body Hamiltonian describing collective neutrino oscillations. The method is derived from the Richardson-Gaudin framework, which involves casting the eigenproblem as a set of coupled nonlinear ""Bethe Ansatz equations"", the solutions of which can then be used to parametrize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The specific approach outlined in this paper consists of defining auxiliary variables that are related to the Bethe-Ansatz parameters, thereby transforming the Bethe-Ansatz equations into a different set of equations that are numerically better behaved and more tractable. We show that it is possible to express not only the eigenvalues, but also the eigenstates, directly in terms of these auxiliary variables without involving the Bethe Ansatz parameters themselves. In this paper, we limit ourselves to a two-flavor, single-angle neutrino system.","Amol V. Patwardhan, Michael J. Cervia, A.

8,"Orbital evolution of binary systems in dense stellar clusters is important in a variety of contexts: origin of blue stragglers, progenitors of compact object mergers, millisecond pulsars, and so on. Here we consider the general problem of secular evolution of the orbital elements of a binary system driven by the smooth tidal field of an axisymmetric stellar cluster (globular, nuclear, etc.) in which the binary orbits. We derive a secular Hamiltonian (averaged over both the inner Keplerian orbit of the binary and its outer orbit within the cluster) valid to quadrupole order for an arbitrary cluster potential and explore its characteristics. This doubly-averaged 'tidal' Hamiltonian depends on just two parameters, which fully absorb the information about the background cluster potential and the binary's orbit within it: a dimensional parameter $A$ setting the secular timescale, and a dimensionless parameter $\Gamma$ which determines the phase portrait of the binary's inner orbital evolution. We examine the dependence of $A$ and $\Gamma$ on cluster potential (both spherical and axisymmetric) and on the binary orbit within the cluster. Our theory reproduces known secular results - such as Lidov-Kozai evolution and the effect of the Galactic tide on Oort Cloud comets - in appropriate limits, but is more general. It provides a universal framework for understanding dynamical evolution of various types of binaries driven by the smooth tidal field of any axisymmetric potential. In a companion paper (Hamilton & Rafikov 2019b) we provide a detailed exploration of the resulting orbital dynamics.","Chris Hamilton, Roman R. Rafikov","24 pages, 13 figures.

9,"Dense stellar clusters are natural sites for the origin and evolution of exotic objects such as relativistic binaries (potential gravitational wave sources), blue stragglers, etc. We investigate the secular dynamics of a binary system driven by the global tidal field of an axisymmetric stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. In a companion paper (Hamilton & Rafikov 2019a) we developed a general Hamiltonian framework describing such systems. The effective (doubly-averaged) Hamiltonian derived there encapsulates all information about the tidal potential experienced by the binary in its orbit around the cluster in a single parameter $\Gamma$. Here we provide a thorough exploration of the phase-space of the corresponding secular problem as $\Gamma$ is varied. We find that for $\Gamma > 1/5$ the phase-space structure and the evolution of binary orbital element are qualitatively similar to the Lidov-Kozai problem. However, this is only one of four possible regimes, because the dynamics are qualitatively changed by bifurcations at $\Gamma = 1/5,0,-1/5$. We show how the dynamics are altered in each regime and calculate characteristics such as secular evolution timescale, maximum possible eccentricity, etc. We verify the predictions of our doubly-averaged formalism numerically and find it to be very accurate when its underlying assumptions are fulfilled, typically meaning that the secular timescale should exceed the period of the binary around the cluster by $\gtrsim 10-10^2$ (depending on the cluster potential and binary orbit). Our results may be relevant for understanding the nature of a variety of exotic systems harboured by stellar clusters.","Chris Hamilton, Roman R. Rafikov","25 pages, 14 figures.

10,"Inspired by a new compilation of strong lensing systems (SLS), which consist of 205 points in the redshift range $0.0625< z_{l} < 0.958$ for the lens galaxy and $0.196< z_{s} < 3.595$ for the source, we constrain three models that generate a late cosmic acceleration: the $\omega$-cold dark matter model, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan parametrizations. Our compilation contains only those systems with early type galaxies acting as lenses, with spectroscopically measured stellar velocity dispersions, estimated Einstein radius of each system, and both the lens and source redshifts. We assume an axially symmetric mass distribution in the lens equation, using a correction to alleviate differences between the measured velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{DM}$) as well as other systematic errors that may affect the measurements. To investigate the impact of some observables, such as the velocity dispersion, the Einstein radius and the redshift interval probed by the lens galaxies, we have considered different sub-samples to constrain the cosmological parameters of each model. Our results show that cosmological constraints are very sensitive to the selected data: some cases show convergence problems in the estimation of cosmological parameters (e.g. systems with observed distance ratio $D^{obs}<0.5$), others show high values for the chi-square function (e.g. systems with a lens equation $D^{obs} >1$ or high velocity dispersion $\sigma > 276$ km s$^{-1}$). Model selection criteria show that using SLS, the $\omega$-cold dark matter and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder models are preferred in different regions of the data.","Mario H. Amante, Juan Magaña, V.

11,"Neutron star interiors provide the opportunity to probe properties of cold dense matter in the QCD phase diagram. Utilizing models of dense matter in accord with nuclear systematics at nuclear densities, we investigate the compatibility of deconfined quark cores with current observational constraints on the maximum-mass and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We explore various methods of implementing the hadron-to-quark phase transition, specifically, first-order transitions with sharp (Maxwell construction) and soft (Gibbs construction) interfaces, and smooth crossover transitions. We find that within the models we apply, hadronic matter has to be stiff for a first-order phase transition and soft for a crossover transition. In both scenarios, quarks most likely appear at the center of canonical neutron stars in the mass range $\approx 1.0-1.6\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ with a sound velocity $c^2_{\rm QM}\gtrsim 0.4$ characteristic of strong repulsive interactions required to support recently discovered neutron stars with masses $\geq 2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also identify equations of state and phase transition scenarios that are consistent with the bounds placed on tidal deformations of neutron stars in the recent binary merger event GW170817. We emphasize that distinguishing hybrid stars with quark cores from normal hadronic stars is very difficult from the knowledge of masses and radii alone, unless drastic sharp transitions induce distinctive disconnected hybrid branches in the mass-radius relation.","Sophia Han, Md.

12,"We present rapid, multiwavelength photometry of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1357.2-0933 during its 2017 outburst. Using several sets of quasi-simultaneous ULTRACAM/NTT (optical), NuSTAR (X-ray), XRT/Swift (X-ray), SALT (optical) and ATCA (radio) observations taken during outburst decline, we confirm the frequent optical dipping that has previously been noted both in outburst and in quiescence. We also find: 1) that the dip frequency decreases as the outburst decays, similar to what was seen in the previous outburst, 2) that the dips produce a shape similar to that in binary systems with partial disc occultations, 3) that the source becomes significantly bluer during these dips, indicating an unusual geometry compared to other LMXB dippers, and 4) that dip superposition analysis confirms the lack of an X-ray response to the optical dips. These very unusual properties appear to be unique to Swift J1357.2-0933, and are likely the result of a high binary inclination, as inferred from features such as its very low outburst X-ray luminosity. From this analysis as well as X-ray/optical timing correlations, we suggest a model with multi-component emission/absorption features with differing colours.

13,"The Calar Alto Fiber-fed \'Echelle spectrograph (CAFE) is a high-resolution spectrographs with high-precision radial velocity capabilities mounted in the 2.2m telescope of Calar Alto Observatory. It suffered from strong degradation after 4 years of operations and it has now been upgraded. The upgrades of the instrument (now named CAFE$_2$) aimed at improving the throughput and stability thanks to the inclusion of a new grating, an active temperature control in the isolated coud\'e room, and a new scrambling system among other minor changes. In this paper, we present the results of the re-commissioning of the instrument and a new pipeline (CAFExtractor) that provides the user with fully reduced data including radial velocity measurements of FGK dwarf stars. We have monitored the upgraded instrument for several months to characterize its main properties and test the new pipeline. It uses part of the CERES code, improves the wavelength calibration and radial velocity extraction (using the HARPS masks adapted), applies nightly drift corrections. The finally reduced spectra are presented in FITS files. The commissioning results show a clear improvement in the instrument performance with respect to the degraded status before the intervention. The room temperature is now stabilized down to 5 mK during one night and below 50 mK over two months. CAFE$_2$ now provides 3 m/s precision on the reference ThAr frames and the on-sky tests provide a radial velocity precision of 8 m/s during one night (for S/N>50). The throughput of the instrument is now back to nominal values with an efficiency of around 15% at 550 nm. The limiting magnitude of the instrument for a 1h exposure and S/N=20 is V=15.

14,We argue that discreteness at the Planck scale (naturally expected to arise from quantum gravity) might manifest in the form of minute violations of energy-momentum conservation of the matter degrees of freedom when described in terms of (idealized) smooth fields on a smooth spacetime. In the context of applications to cosmology such `energy diffusion' from the low energy matter degrees of freedom to the discrete structures underlying spacetime leads to the emergence of an effective dark energy term in Einstein's equations. We estimate this effect using a (relational) hypothesis about the materialization of discreteness in quantum gravity which is motivated by the strict observational constraints supporting the validity of Lorentz invariance at low energies. The predictions coming from simple dimensional analysis yield a cosmological constant of the order of magnitude of the observed value without fine tuning.,"Alejandro Perez, Daniel Sudarsky","Typos corrected, closer to published version",1711.05183v4,No journal ref found,Daniel Sudarsky,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05183v4,2017-11-14 16:44:21+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|hep-ph|hep-th,Dark energy from quantum gravity discreteness,2019-06-10 14:27:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05183v4
15,"We present an asymptotically and unconditionally stable numerical method to account for the momentum transfer between multiple species. Momentum is conserved to machine precision. This implies that the asymptotic equilibrium corresponds to the velocity of the center of mass. Aimed at studying dust dynamics, we implement this numerical method in the publicly available code FARGO3D. To validate our implementation, we develop a test suite for an arbitrary number of species, based on analytical or exact solutions of problems related to perfect damping, damped sound waves, shocks, local and global gas-dust radial drift in a disk and, linear streaming instability. In particular, we obtain first-order, steady-state solutions for the radial drift of multiple dust species in protoplanetary disks, in which the pressure gradient is not necessarily small. We additionally present non-linear shearing-box simulations of the streaming instability and compare them with previous results obtained with Lagrangian particles. We successfully validate our implementation by recovering the solutions from the test suite to second- and first-order accuracy in space and time, respectively. From this, we conclude that our scheme is suitable, and very robust, to study the self-consistent dynamics of several fluids. In particular, it can be used for solving the collisions between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks, with any degree of coupling.","Pablo Benítez-Llambay, Leonardo Krapp, Martín E.

16,"Stabilizing the gain of a radio astronomy receiver is of great importance for sensitive radio intensity mapping. In this paper we discuss a stabilization method using a continuous-wave reference signal injected into the signal chain and tracked in a single channel of the spectrometer to correct for the gain variations of the receiver. This method depends on the fact that gain fluctuations of the receiver are strongly correlated across the frequency band, which we can show is the case for our experimental setup. This method is especially suited for receivers with a digital back-end with high spectral resolution and moderate dynamic range. The sensitivity of the receiver is unaltered except for one lost frequency channel.

17,"The understanding of magnetic reconnection in three-dimension (3D) is far shallower than its counterpart in two-dimension (2D) due to its potential complication, not to mention the evolving of the spontaneously growing turbulence. We investigate the reason for reconnection acceleration on the characters and development of diffusion regions and sheared 3D energy modes (energy modes that are not parallel to the anti-parallel magnetic fields) during the turbulence building stage. We found that multiple reconnection layers emerge due to the growth of 3D sheared tearing instability. Diffusion regions on adjacent reconnection layers form an inflow-outflow coupling that enhances the local reconnection. Further coupling of the existing energy modes breeds new energy modes near the current sheet edge. As reconnection layers span and interact with each other across the whole current sheet, global magnetic energy consumption accelerates. The significant contribution of 3D energy modes and their interaction to the reconnection rate enhancement seems to be independent on magnetic diffusivity. On the other hand, the global guide field changes the layout of 3D reconnection layer thus determines whether the system is fast-reconnection-preferable.","Shuoyang Wang, Takaaki Yokoyama","13 pages, 14 figures",1906.03964v1,No journal ref found,Takaaki Yokoyama,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03964v1,2019-06-10 13:24:01+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Diffusion regions and 3D energy mode development in spontaneous   reconnection,2019-06-10 13:24:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03964v1
18,"The extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke (eJBD) theory of gravity is constrained by a host of astrophysical and cosmological observations spanning a wide range of scales. The current cosmological constraints on the first post-Newtonian parameter in these simplest eJBD models in which the recent acceleration of the Universe is connected with the variation of the effective gravitational strength are consistent, but approximately two order of magnitude larger than the time-delay test within the Solar System. We forecast the capabilities of future galaxy surveys in combination with current and future CMB anisotropies measurements to further constrain the simplest dark energy models within eJBD theory of gravity. By considering two cases of a monomial potential (a quartic potential or a cosmological constant), we show how Euclid-like galaxy clustering and weak lensing data in combination with BOSS and future CMB observations have the potential to reach constraints on the first post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_{\rm PN}$ comparable to those from the Solar System.","Mario Ballardini, Domenico Sapone, Caterina Umiltà, Fabio Finelli, Daniela Paoletti","14 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

19,A scalar field rolling down a potential with a large initial velocity results in inflation of a finite duration. Such a scenario suppresses the scalar power on large scales improving the fit to the cosmological data. We find that the scenario leads to a hitherto unexplored situation wherein the boundary terms dominate the contributions to the scalar bispectrum over the bulk terms. We show that the consistency relation governing the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ is violated on large scales and that the contributions at the initial time can substantially enhance the value of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$.,"H.

20,"Aims: Our scientific goal is to provide revised membership lists of the Alpha Per, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters exploiting the second data release of Gaia and produce five-dimensional maps (ra, dec, parallax, pmRA, pmDEC) of these clusters.   Methods: We implemented the kinematic method combined with the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions to identify astrometric member candidates of three of the most nearby and best studied open clusters in the sky.   Results: We cross-correlated the Gaia catalogue with large-scale public surveys to complement the astrometry of Gaia with multi-band photometry from the optical to the mid-infrared. We identified 517, 1248, and 721 bona-fide astrometric member candidates inside the tidal radius of the Alpha Per, the Pleiades, and Praesepe, respectively. We cross-matched our final samples with catalogues from previous surveys to address the level of completeness. We update the main physical properties of the clusters, including mean distance and velocity as well as core, half-mass, and tidal radii. We infer updated ages from the white dwarf members of the Pleiades and Praesepe. We derive the luminosity and mass functions of the three clusters and compare them to the field mass function. We compute the positions in space of all member candidates in the three regions to investigate their distribution in space.   Conclusions: We provide updated distances and kinematics for the three clusters. We identify a list of members in the Alpha Per, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters from the most massive stars all the way down into the hydrogen-burning limit with a higher confidence and better astrometry than previous studies. We produce complete 5D maps of stellar and substellar bona-fide members in these three regions. ABRIDGED","N. Lodieu, A. Perez-Garrido, R. L. Smart, R.

21,"Using $N$-body simulations we study the buckling instability in a galactic bar forming in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The galaxy is initially composed of an axisymmetric, exponential stellar disk embedded in a spherical NFW dark matter halo. The parameters of the model are chosen so that the galaxy is mildly unstable to bar formation and the evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. A strong bar forms slowly over the first few Gyr and buckles after 4.5 Gyr from the start of the simulation becoming much weaker and developing a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. We measure the properties of the bar at the time of buckling in terms of the distortion and streaming velocity in the vertical direction. The maps of these quantities in face-on projections reveal characteristic quadrupole patterns which wind up over a short time-scale. We also detect a secondary buckling event lasting much longer and occurring only in the outer part of the bar. We then study the orbital structure of the bar in periods before and after the first buckling. We find that most of the buckling orbits originate from x1 orbits supporting the bar. During buckling the ratio of the vertical to horizontal frequency of the stellar orbits decreases dramatically and after buckling the orbits obey a very tight relation between the vertical and circular frequency: $3 \nu = 4 \Omega$. We propose that buckling is initiated by the vertical resonance of the x1 orbits creating the initial distortion of the bar that later evolves as kinematic bending waves.",Ewa L.

22,"Combining the precise parallaxes and optical photometry delivered by Gaia's second data release (Gaia DR2) with the photometric catalogues of PanSTARRS-1, 2MASS, and AllWISE, we derive Bayesian stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for 265 million stars brighter than G=18. Because of the wide wavelength range used, our results substantially improve the accuracy and precision of previous extinction and effective temperature estimates. After cleaning our results for both unreliable input and output data, we retain 137 million stars, for which we achieve a median precision of 5% in distance, 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, and 245 K in effective temperature for G<14, degrading towards fainter magnitudes (12%, 0.20 mag, and 245 K at G=16; 16%, 0.23 mag, and 260 K at G=17, respectively).

We developed a new experimental method to investigate the response of evaporitic minerals (halite and gypsum) to impact shocks in an open system. This technique does not result in chemical contamination from the operation of the gas gun. The technique is termed the two-valve method and the gun system is located in the Planetary Exploration Research Center, Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan. We detected the vaporization of halite at 31 GPa and devolatilization from gypsum at 11 GPa, suggesting that impact-induced volatile release from dry lakebeds has periodically occurred throughout Martian history. The vaporization of halite deposits might have enhanced the production of perchlorates, which are found globally on Mars. The water loss from gypsum possibly explains the coexisting types of Ca-sulfates found in Gale Crater.","Kosuke Kurosawa, Ryota Moriwaki, Goro Komatsu, Takaya Okamoto, Hiroshi Sakuma, Hikaru Yabuta, Takafumi Matsui","17 pages, 4 figures, 1 supporting information, accepted for

24,"The streaming instability is thought to play a central role in the early stages of planet formation by enabling the efficient bypass of a number of barriers hindering the formation of planetesimals. We present the first study exploring the efficiency of the linear streaming instability when a particle-size distribution is considered. We find that, for a given dust-to-gas mass ratio, the multi-species streaming instability grows on timescales much longer than those expected when only one dust species is involved. In particular, distributions that contain close-to-order-unity dust-to-gas mass ratios lead to unstable modes that can grow on timescales comparable, or larger, with those of secular instabilities. We anticipate that processes leading to particle segregation and/or concentration can create favourable conditions for the instability to grow fast. Our findings may have important implications for a large number of processes in protoplanetary disks that rely on the streaming instability as usually envisioned for a unique dust species. Our results suggest that the growth rates of other resonant-drag-instabilities may also decrease considerably when multiple species are considered.","Leonardo Krapp, Pablo Benítez-Llambay, Oliver Gressel, Martin E.

26,"If the alpha effect plays a role in the generation of the Sun's magnetic field, the field should show evidence of magnetic helicity of opposite signs at large and small length scales. Measuring this faces two challenges: (i) in weak-field regions, horizontal field measurements are unreliable because of the pi ambiguity, and (ii) one needs a truly global approach to computing helicity spectra in the case where one expects a sign reversal across the equator at all wavenumbers. Here we develop such a method using spin-2 spherical harmonics to decompose the linear polarization in terms of the parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarizations, respectively. Using simple one- and two-dimensional models, we show that the product of the spectral decompositions of E and B, taken at spherical harmonic degrees that are shifted by one, is a good proxy of the magnetic helicity. We then apply this method to the analysis of solar synoptic vector magnetograms, from which we extract a pseudo-polarization corresponding to a ``pi-ambiguated'' magnetic field, i.e., a magnetic field vector that has no arrow. We find opposite signs of the global helicity proxy for spherical harmonic degrees larger or smaller than around 10, which corresponds to an effective wavenumber of around 0.014 Mm^{-1}. We argue that our global two-scale helicity proxy constitutes a new powerful measure that is worth applying routinely and over many more synoptic vector magnetograms. It might also be applicable to stellar and Galactic polarization data.",Axel Brandenburg,"8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to ApJ",1906.03877v1,No journal ref found,Axel Brandenburg,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03877v1,2019-06-10 10:17:24+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,A global two-scale helicity proxy from $π$-ambiguous solar magnetic   fields,2019-06-10 10:17:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03877v1
27,"We determined the chemical and kinematic properties of the Galactic thin and thick disk using a sample of 307,246 A/F/G/K-type giant stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey and Gaia DR2 survey. Our study found that the thick disk globally exhibits no metallicity radial gradient, but the inner disk ($R \le 8$ kpc) and the outer disk ($R>8$ kpc) have different gradients when they are studied separately. The thin disk also shows two different metallicity radial gradients for the inner disk and the outer disk, and has steep metallicity vertical gradient of d[Fe/H]/d$|z|$ $=-0.12\pm0.0007$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, but it becomes flat when it is measured at increasing radial distance, while the metallicity radial gradient becomes weaker with increasing vertical distance. Adopting a galaxy potential model, we derived the orbital eccentricity of sample stars and found a downtrend of average eccentricity with increasing metallicity for the thick disk. The variation of the rotation velocity with the metallicity shows a positive gradient for the thick disk stars and a negative one for the thin disk stars. Comparisons of our observed results with models of disk formation suggest that radial migration could have influenced the chemical evolution of the thin disk. The formation of the thick disk could be affected by more than one processes: the accretion model could play an indispensable role, while other formation mechanisms, such as the radial migration or heating scenario model could also have a contribution.","Yepeng Yan, Cuihua Du, Shuai Liu, Hefan Li, Jianrong Shi, Yuqin Chen, Jun Ma, Zhenyu Wu","14 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ",1906.03875v1,No journal ref found,Zhenyu Wu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03875v1,2019-06-10 10:14:21+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Chemical and Kinematic Properties of the Galactic Disk from the LAMOST   and Gaia Sample Stars,2019-06-10 10:14:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03875v1
28,"Radio surveys are widely used to study active galactic nuclei. Radio interferometric observations typically trade-off surface brightness sensitivity for angular resolution. Hence, observations using a wide range of baseline lengths are required to recover both bright small-scale structures and diffuse extended emission. We investigate if generative adversarial networks (GANs) can extract additional information from radio data and might ultimately recover extended flux from a survey with a high angular resolution and vice versa. We use a GAN for the image-to-image translation between two different data sets, namely the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio surveys. The GAN is trained to generate the corresponding image cutout from the other survey for a given input. The results are analyzed with a variety of metrics, including structural similarity as well as flux and size comparison of the extracted sources. RadioGAN is able to recover extended flux density within a $20\%$ margin for almost half of the sources and learns more complex relations between sources in the two surveys than simply convolving them with a different synthesized beam. RadioGAN is also able to achieve subbeam resolution by recognizing complicated underlying structures from unresolved sources. RadioGAN generates over a third of the sources within a $20\%$ deviation from both original size and flux for the FIRST to NVSS translation, while for the NVSS to FIRST mapping it achieves almost $30\%$ within this range.","Nina Glaser, O Ivy Wong, Kevin Schawinski, Ce Zhang",No comment found,1906.03874v1,No journal ref found,Ce Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03874v1,2019-06-10 09:54:27+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.IM,RadioGAN - Translations between different radio surveys with generative   adversarial networks,2019-06-10 09:54:27+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03874v1

31,"Redshift-space distortions are a sensitive probe of the growth of large-scale structure. In the linear regime, redshift-space distortions are fully described by the multipoles of the two-point correlation function. In the nonlinear regime, however, higher-order statistics are needed to capture the full information of the galaxy density field. In this paper, we show that the redshift-space line correlation function--which is a measure of Fourier phase correlations--is sensitive to the nonlinear growth of the density and velocity fields and to the nonlinear mapping between real and redshift space. We expand the line correlation function in multipoles, and we show that almost all of the information is encoded in the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole. We argue that these multipoles are highly complementary to the multipoles of the two-point correlation function: first, because they are directly sensitive to the difference between the density and the velocity coupling kernels, which is a purely nonlinear quantity; and second, because the multipoles are proportional to different combinations of $f$ and $\sigma_8$. Measured in conjunction with the two-point correlation function and the bispectrum, the multipoles of the line correlation function could therefore allow us to disentangle efficiently these two quantities and to test modified theories of gravity.","Felipe O.

32,"The lack of power anomaly is an intriguing feature at the largest angular scales of the CMB anisotropy temperature pattern, whose statistical significance is not strong enough to claim any new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. We revisit the former statement by also considering polarisation data. We propose a new one-dimensional estimator which takes jointly into account the information contained in the TT, TE and EE CMB spectra. By employing this estimator on Planck 2015 low-$\ell$ data, we find that a random $\Lambda$CDM realisation is statistically accepted at the level of $3.68 \%$. Even though Planck polarisation contributes a mere $4 \%$ to the total information budget, its use pushes the lower-tail-probability down from the $7.22 \%$ obtained with only temperature data. Forecasts of future CMB polarised measurements, as e.g. the LiteBIRD satellite, can increase the polarisation contribution up to $6$ times with respect to Planck at low-$\ell$. We argue that the large-scale E-mode polarisation may play an important role in analysing CMB temperature anomalies with future mission.","M. Billi, A. Gruppuso, N. Mandolesi, L. Moscardini, P.

34,"Random projection (RP) is a powerful dimension reduction technique widely used in the analysis of high dimensional data. We demonstrate how this technique can be used to improve the computational efficiency of gravitational wave searches from compact binaries of neutron stars or black holes. Improvements in low-frequency response and bandwidth due to detector hardware upgrades pose a data analysis challenge in the advanced LIGO era as they result in increased redundancy in template databases and longer templates due to the higher number of signal cycles in-band. The RP-based methods presented here address both these issues within the same broad framework. We first use RP for an efficient, singular value decomposition inspired template matrix factorization and develop a geometric intuition for why this approach works. We then use RP to calculate approximate time-domain match correlations in a lower dimensional vector space. For searches over parameters corresponding to non-spinning binaries with a neutron star and a black hole, a combination of the two methods can reduce the total on-line computational cost by an order of magnitude over a nominal baseline. This can, in turn, help free-up computational resources needed to go beyond current spin-aligned searches to more complex ones involving generically spinning waveforms.","Sumeet Kulkarni, Khun Sang Phukon, Amit Reza, Sukanta Bose, Anirban Dasgupta, Dilip Krishnaswamy, Anand S.

35,"The environment of supernova remnants (SNRs) is a key factor in their evolution, particularly at later stages of their existence. It is often assumed that mixed-morphology (MM) SNRs evolve in very dense environments, and that their centre-filled X-ray morphology is due to interactions between the SNRs and their surroundings. We aim to determine whether MMSNR VRO 42.05.01 is embedded in, and interacting with, a dense molecular environment. We used the IRAM telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain, to search for interaction between the SNR and neighbouring molecular clouds. We observed a region of $26'\times14'$ towards the west of VRO 42.05.01 and a region of $8'\times4'$ towards the north of the remnant in the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$, $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$, and $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ transitions with the EMIR receiver. We made maps of the properties of the observed molecular clouds (peak temperatures, central velocities, velocity dispersions), column density along the line of sight, and ratio of the $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ to $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ transitions. We analyse archival optical, infrared, and radio spectroscopic data for other hints on the nature of the medium. We do not find conclusive physical proof that the SNR is interacting with the few, clumpy molecular clouds that surround it in the region of our observations, although there is some suggestion of such interaction (in a region outside our map) from infrared emission. There is a velocity gradient in one of the molecular clouds that is consistent with a stellar wind blown by a $12-14$ $M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. We reassess the literature distance to VRO 42.05.01, and propose that it has a local standard of rest velocity of $-6$ km s$^{-1}$, and that it is located $1.0\pm0.4$ kpc away (the earlier distance value was $4.5\pm1.5$ kpc). We find that a dust sheet intersects VRO 42.05.01 and is possibly related to its double shell-shaped morphology.","Maria Arias, Vladimir Domcek, Ping Zhou, Jacco Vink",Accepted in A&A,1906.03801v1,No journal ref found,Jacco Vink,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03801v1,2019-06-10 05:39:46+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,The environment of supernova remnant VRO 42.05.01 as probed with IRAM   30m molecular line observations,2019-06-10 05:39:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03801v1
36,"We report on OVRO, WISE, Swift and Fermi-LAT observations of the high redshift blazar CGRaBS J0733+0456, from which significant flux variations in radio, infrared (IR) as well as $\gamma$-ray domains are detected. Particularly, the amplitude of long-term IR variation is over one order of magnitude and the IR variability timescale can be constrained as short as a few hours in the source frame. The IR and $\gamma$-ray light curves are found to be rather similar, and the strong quasi-simultaneous infrared and $\gamma$-ray flares are proved to be unique among the nearby $\gamma$-ray sources. This is the first time to identify a $\gamma-$ray blazar at redshift $z\geq 3$ with multi-wavelength flux variations (flares). Broadband spectral energy distributions in different flux states are constructed and theoretically described.

37,"Microlensing of stars, e.g. in the Galactic bulge and Andromeda galaxy (M31), is among the most robust, powerful method to constrain primordial black holes (PBHs) that are a viable candidate of dark matter. If PBHs are in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH} \lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;$} 10^{-10}M_\odot$, its Schwarzschild radius ($r_{\rm Sch}$) becomes comparable with or shorter than optical wavelength ($\lambda)$ used in a microlensing search, and in this regime the wave optics effect on microlensing needs to be taken into account. For a lensing PBH with mass satisfying $r_{\rm Sch}\sim \lambda$, it causes a characteristic oscillatory feature in the microlensing light curve, and it will give a smoking gun evidence of PBH if detected, because any astrophysical object cannot have such a tiny Schwarzschild radius. Even in a statistical study, e.g. constraining the abundance of PBHs from a systematic search of microlensing events for a sample of many source stars, the wave effect needs to be taken into account. We examine the impact of wave effect on the PBH constraints obtained from the $r$-band (6210\AA) monitoring observation of M31 stars in Niikura et al. (2019), and find that a finite source size effect is dominant over the wave effect for PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq[10^{-11},10^{-10}]M_\odot$. We also discuss that, if a denser-cadence (10~sec), $g$-band monitoring observation for a sample of white dwarfs over a year timescale is available, it would allow one to explore the wave optics effect on microlensing light curve, if it occurs, or improve the PBH constraints in $M_{\rm PBH}\lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;$} 10^{-11}M_\odot$ even from a null detection.","Sunao Sugiyama, Toshiki Kurita, Masahiro Takada","10 pages, 7 figures; typos in equations are corrected and Figures 6

39,"The morphology of spectral line polarization is the most valuable observable to investigate the magnetic and dynamic solar atmosphere. However, in order to develop solar diagnosis, it is fundamental to understand the different kinds of anomalous solar signals that have been routinely found in linear and circular polarization (LP,CP). The goal of this paper has been to explain and characterize the morphology of solar CP signals by understanding the combined effect of magnetic fields, velocity gradients, and atomic orientation in general NLTE regime. To that aim, an analytical two-layer model of the polarized radiative transfer equation is developed and used to solve the NLTE problem with atomic polarization in a semi-parametric way. The formation of polarization is thus insightfully described with certain precision without resorting in MHD models or sacrifying key physical ingredients. The potential of the model for reproducing solar anomalous CP is shown with detailed calculations. The essential physical behavior of dichroism and atomic orientation is described, introducing the concepts of dichroic inversion, neutral and reinforcing medium, critic intensity spectrum, and critic source function. It is shown that the zero-crossings of the CP spectrum are useful to classify its morphology and understand its formation. This led to identify and explain the morphology of the seven most characteristics CP signals that a single (depth-resolved) scattering layer can produce. Futhermore, it is found that a minimal number of two magnetic layers along the LOS is required to fully explain anomalous solar CP signals, and that the morphology and polarity of Stokes V depends on magnetic, radiative and atomic polarities. Some implications of these results are presented through a preliminar modeling of anomalous CP signals in the Na I D and Fe I 1564.8 nm lines.",Edgar S. Carlin,"18 pages, 18 figures.

We use the Chaotic and the $R^2$ potentials to demonstrate that a possible deflation before the bounce may counteract the inflation that is needed for resolving the cosmological conundrums, so a certain level of time asymmetry is required for the models in LQC. This $\phi_{\rm B}$ is model dependent and closely related to the amounts of deflation and inflation, so we may use observations to confine $\phi_{\rm B}$ and thus the model parameters. With further studies this formalism should be useful in providing an observational testbed for the LQC models.","Wen-Hsuan Lucky Chang, Jiun-Huei Proty Wu","7 pages, with 7 figures and 4 tables",1807.05659v2,No journal ref found,Jiun-Huei Proty Wu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05659v2,2018-07-16 02:34:55+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,Time Asymmetry of Cosmic Background Evolution in Loop Quantum Cosmology,2019-06-09 20:23:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05659v2
41,"The combined detection of a gravitational-wave signal, kilonova, and short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) from GW170817 marked a scientific breakthrough in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. But even before GW170817, there have been a number of sGRBs with possible associated kilonova detections. In this work, we re-examine these ""historical"" sGRB afterglows with a combination of state-of-the-art afterglow and kilonova models. This allows us to include optical/near-infrared synchrotron emission produced by the sGRB as well as ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared emission powered by the radioactive decay of $r$-process elements (i.e., the kilonova). Fitting the lightcurves, we derive the velocity and the mass distribution as well as the composition of the ejected material. The posteriors on kilonova parameters obtained from the fit were turned into distributions for the peak magnitude of the kilonova emission in different bands and the time at which this peak occurs. From the sGRB with an associated kilonova, we found that the peak magnitude in H bands falls in the range [-16.2, -13.1] ($95\%$ of confidence) and occurs within $0.8-3.6\,\rm days$ after the sGRB prompt emission. In g band instead we obtain a peak magnitude in range [-16.8, -12.3] occurring within the first $18\,\rm hr$ after the sGRB prompt. From the luminosity distributions of GW170817/AT2017gfo, kilonova candidates GRB130603B, GRB050709 and GRB060614 (with the possible inclusion of GRB150101B) and the upper limits from all the other sGRBs not associated with any kilonova detection we obtain for the first time a kilonova luminosity function in different bands.","Stefano Ascenzi, Michael W.

42,"We present the first attempt to fit the light curve of the interstellar visitor `Oumuamua using a physical model which includes optional torque. We consider both conventional (Lommel-Seeliger triaxial ellipsoid) and alternative (""black-and-white ball"", ""solar sail"") brightness models. With all the brightness models, some torque is required to explain the timings of the most conspicuous features -- deep minima -- of the asteroid's light curve. Our best-fitting models are a thin disc (aspect ratio 1:6) and a thin cigar (aspect ratio 1:8) which are very close to being axially symmetric. Both models are tumbling and require some torque which has the same amplitude in relation to `Oumuamua's linear non-gravitational acceleration as in Solar System comets which dynamics is affected by outgassing. Assuming random orientation of the angular momentum vector, we compute probabilities for our best-fitting models. We show that cigar-shaped models suffer from a fine-tuning problem and have only 16 per cent probability to produce light curve minima as deep as the ones present in `Oumuamua's light curve. Disc-shaped models, on the other hand, are very likely (at 91 per cent) to produce minima of the required depth. From our analysis, the most likely model for `Oumuamua is a thin disc (slab) experiencing moderate torque from outgassing.",Sergey Mashchenko,"21 pages, 11 figures",1906.03696v1,No journal ref found,Sergey Mashchenko,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03696v1,2019-06-09 19:27:32+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Modeling the light curve of `Oumuamua: evidence for torque and disc-like   shape,2019-06-09 19:27:32+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03696v1
43,"With the observational advance in recent years, primordial gravitational waves (GWs), known as the tensor-mode cosmic perturbations, in the Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) are becoming testable and thus require better framework through which to bridge between the observations and the theories. In this work we present a new formalism that employs the transfer functions to bring the GWs from any epoch, even before the quantum bounce, to a later time, including the present. The evolutionary epochs considered here include the possible deflation, quantum bounce, and inflation. This formalism enables us to predict more accurately the GW power spectrum today. With the ADM formalism for the LQC background dynamics, our approach is equivalent to the commonly used Bogoliubov transformations for evolving the primordial GWs, but more transparent for discussions and easier to calculate due to its nature of being linear algebra dealing with linear perturbations. We utilize this advantage to have resolved the IR suppression problem. We also propose the field-free approximation for the effective mass in the quantum bounce epoch to largely improve the accuracy in the predicted GW power spectrum. Our transfer-function formalism is general in dealing with any linear problems, and thus expected to be equally useful under other context with linearity.","Wen-Hsuan Lucky Chang, Jiun-Huei Proty Wu","17 pages, 9 figures",1806.10508v3,No journal ref found,Jiun-Huei Proty Wu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10508v3,2018-06-27 14:47:22+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,New Approach to Evolving Gravitational Waves in Loop Quantum Cosmology,2019-06-09 18:40:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10508v3

We detect the Ne VIII doublet in nine of the galaxies, and for gas with N(Ne VIII) > 10^13.3 cm^-2 (> 10^13.5 cm^-2), we derive a Ne VIII covering fraction f_c = 75 +15/-25% (44 +22/-20%) within impact parameter (rho) < 200 kpc of M_* = 10^(9.5-11.5) Msol galaxies and f_c = 70 +16/-22% (f_c = 42 +20/-17%) within rho < 1.5 virial radii. We estimate the mass in Ne VIII-traced gas to be M_gas(Ne VIII) > 10^9.5 Msol (Z/Zsol)^-1, or 6-20% of the expected baryonic mass if the Ne VIII absorbers have solar metallicity. Ionizing Ne VII to Ne VIII requires 207 eV, and photons with this energy are scarce in the CGM. However, for the median halo mass and redshift of our sample, the virial temperature is close to the peak temperature for the Ne VIII ion, and the Ne VIII-bearing gas is plausibly collisionally ionized near this temperature. Moreover, we find that photoionized Ne VIII requires cool and low-density clouds that would be highly underpressured (by approximately two orders of magnitude) relative to the putative, ambient virialized medium, complicating scenarios where such clouds could survive. Thus, more complex (e.g., non-equilibrium) models may be required; this first statistical sample of Ne VIII absorber/galaxy systems will provide stringent constraints for future CGM studies.","Joseph N.

45,"We present VLA HI observations of JO206, a prototypical ram-pressure stripped galaxy in the GASP sample. This massive galaxy (M$_{\ast} =$ 8.5 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) is located at a redshift of $z =$ 0.0513, near the centre of the low-mass galaxy cluster, IIZw108 ($\sigma \sim575$ km/s). JO206 is characterised by a long tail ($\geq$90 kpc) of ionised gas stripped away by ram-pressure. We find a similarly long HI tail in the same direction as the ionised gas tail and measure a total HI mass of $3.2 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This is about half the expected HI mass given the stellar mass and surface density of JO206. A total of $1.8 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ (60%) of the detected HI is in the gas stripped tail. An analysis of the star formation rate shows that the galaxy is forming more stars compared to galaxies with the same stellar and HI mass. On average we find a HI gas depletion time of $\sim$0.5 Gyr which is about four times shorter than that of ""normal"" spiral galaxies. We performed a spatially resolved analysis of the relation between star formation rate density and gas density in the disc and tail of the galaxy at the resolution of our HI data. The star formation efficiency of the disc is about 10 times higher than that of the tail at fixed HI surface densities. Both the inner and outer parts of JO206 show an enhanced star formation compared to regions of similar HI surface density in field galaxies. The enhanced star formation is due to ram-pressure stripping during the galaxy's first infall into the cluster.","M. Ramatsoku, P. Serra, B. M Poggianti, A. Moretti, M. Gullieuszik, D. Bettoni, T.

46,"Non-standard fields are assumed to be responsible for phenomena attributed to dark energy and dark matter. Being coupled to ordinary matter, these fields modify the masses and/or charges of the elementary particles, thereby violating the Weak Equivalence Principle. Thus, values of fundamental constants such as the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu, and/or the fine structure constant, alpha, measured in different environment conditions can be used as probes for this coupling. Here we perform differential measurements of F = mu*alpha^2 to test a non-standard coupling in the Magellanic Clouds - dwarf galaxies where the overall mass budget is dominated by dark matter. The analysis is based on [CI] and CO lines observed with the Herschel Space Observatory. Since these lines have different sensitivities to changes in mu and alpha, the combined alpha and mu variations can be evaluated through the radial velocity offsets, Delta V, between the CO and [CI] lines. Averaging over nine positions in the Magellanic Clouds, we obtain <Delta V> = -0.02+/-0.07 km/s, leading to |Delta F/F| < 2*10^-7 (1sigma), where Delta F/F = (F_obs-F_lab)/F_lab}. However, for one position observed with five times higher spectral resolution we find Delta V = -0.05+/-0.02 km/s, resulting in Delta F/F = (-1.7+/-0.7)*10^-7. Whether this offset is due to changes in the fundamental constants, due to chemical segregation in the emitting gas or merely due to Doppler noise requires further investigations.","S. A.

47,"Observatories and satellites around the globe produce tremendous amounts of imaging data to study many different astrophysical phenomena. The serendipitous observations of Solar System objects are a fortunate by-product which have often been neglected due to the lack of a simple yet efficient identification algorithm. Meanwhile, the determination of the orbit, chemical composition, and physical properties such as rotation period and 3D-shape of Solar System objects requires a large number of astrometry and multi-band photometry observations. Such observations are hidden in current and future astrophysical archives, and a method to harvest these goldmines is needed.   This article presents an easy-to-implement, light-weight software package which detects bodies of the Solar System in astronomical images and measures their astrometry and photometry. The ssos pipeline is versatile, allowing for application to all kinds of observatory imaging products. The sole principle requirement is that the images observe overlapping areas of the sky within a reasonable time range. Both known and unknown Solar System objects are recovered, from fast-moving near-Earth asteroids to slow objects in the Kuiper belt.   The high-level pipeline design and two test applications are described here, highlighting the versatility of the algorithm with both narrow-field pointed and wide-field survey observations. In the first study, 2,828 detections of 204 SSOs are recovered from publicly available images of the GTC OSIRIS Broad Band DR1. The false-positive ratio of SSO detections ranges from 0%-23% depending on the pipeline setup.

48,"[Shortened Abstract:] This thesis explores the possibility that quantum probabilities arose thermodynamically. A chief concern is the detection of primordial `quantum nonequilibrium', since this is observably distinct from textbook quantum physics. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are adaptations of references [1,2,3], and [4] respectively.   Chapter 2 proposes (information) entropy conservation as a minimal requirement for a theory to feature classical-style thermodynamic relaxation. The resulting structure is dubbed `the iRelax framework'. Both classical mechanics and de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory are shown to be special cases. Indications for a possible extension or unification of de Broglie-Bohm theory are briefly highlighted.   Chapter 3 examines ways in which quantum relaxation may be prevented. The method of the drift-field is introduced. A systematic treatment of nodes is given. A category of quantum states is found for which relaxation is significantly impeded, and may not complete at all.   Chapters 4 and 5 consider the possibility that primordial quantum nonequilibrium may be conserved in the statistics of a species of relic cosmological particle. Necessary factors for this to be the case are discussed and illustrative scenarios are given both in terms of nonequilibrium particles created by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes for species that decoupled close to the Planck temperature. The search for so-called `smoking-gun' spectral lines created by dark matter decay or annihilation is argued to be a particularly promising setting for the detection of quantum nonequilibrium. Unintuitive spectral effects relating to the contextuality of quantum measurements are described. If such a suspected source of quantum nonequilibrium were found, its subjection to a specifically quantum mechanical test would confirm or deny the presence of the quantum nonequilibrium conclusively.",Nicolas G.

49,"Our knowledge and understanding of the Universe is mainly based on observations of the electromagnetic radiation in a wide range of wavelengths. Only during the past two decades, new kinds of detectors have been developed, exploiting other forms of cosmic probes: individual photons with energy above the GeV, charged particles and antiparticles, neutrinos and, finally, gravitational waves. These new ``telescopes'' leaded to unexpected breakthroughs. Years 2016 and 2017 have seen the dawn of the astrophysics and cosmology with gravitational waves, awarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize. The events GW150914 (the first black hole-black hole merger) and GW170817 (the coalescence of two neutron stars, producing a short gamma-ray burst and follow-up observed by more than 70 observatories on all continents and in space) represent really milestones in science that every physicist (senior or in formation) should appreciate.   In this document, after an accessible discussion on the generation and propagation of GWs, the key features of observable quantities (the strain, the GW frequency $\nu_{gw}$, and $\dot \nu_{gw}$) of GW150914 and GW170817 are discussed using Newtonian physics, dimensional analysis and analogies with electromagnetic waves. The objective is to show how astrophysical quantities (the initial and final masses of merging objects, the energy loss, the distance, their spin) are derived from observables. The results from the fully general-relativistic analysis published in the two discovery papers are compared with the output of our simple treatment. Then, some of the outcomes of GW observations are discussed in terms of multimessenger astrophysics.",Maurizio Spurio,"This document contains (in a self-consistent way) most of the

50,"Recent supernova searches revealed a number of fast-evolving luminous transients. We perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of light curves of several models of supernova from super--asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars with low mass envelopes ($M_{\rm env}$ $\sim$ $0.05-1.25$ $M_{\odot}$). The differences in the light curves found among the models are used to link the observed events to the most appropriate models. In particular, we propose that KSN 2015K is an electron-capture supernova. We assume ""optically"" thick CSM around SAGB and the circumstellar interaction powers the peak luminosity of the light curve with a short rise time. The faint tail might be influenced by the spin-down luminosity of a newborn Crab-like pulsar. Our fits indicate an ejecta mass of $0.02-0.05$ $M_{\odot}$, a circumstellar medium (CSM) mass of $0.10-0.12$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of the CSM photosphere $\sim$ 10$^{14}$ cm, a kinetic energy of $\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{50}$ erg, a photospheric velocity $v_{\rm ph} \gtrsim 10,000$ km s$^{-1}$ and a pulsar total spin energy ($2.5-4$) $\times$ 10$^{49}$ erg.","Alexey Tolstov, Ken'ichi Nomoto, Elena Sorokina, Sergei Blinnikov, Nozomu Tominaga, Yoshiaki Taniguchi","5 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

51,"Solar hard X-rays (HXRs) appear in the form of either footpoint sources or coronal sources, and each individual source provides its own critical information on acceleration of nonthermal electrons and plasma heating. Earlier studies found that the HXR emission in some events manifests a broken-up power-law spectrum with the break energy around a few hundred keV based on spatially-integrated spectral analysis, without distinguishing the contributions from individual sources. In this paper, we report the broken-up spectra of a coronal source studied using HXR data recorded by Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) during the SOL2017-09-10T16:06 (GOES class X8.2) flare. The flare occurred behind the western limb with its foot-point sources mostly occulted by the disk, and we could clearly identify such broken-up spectra pertaining solely to the coronal source during the flare peak time and after. Since a significant pileup effect on the RHESSI spectra is expected for this intense solar flare, we have selected the pileup correction factor, $p = 2$. In this case, we found the resulting \textit{RHESSI} temperature (~30 MK) similar to the GOES soft X-ray temperature and break energies of 45--60 keV. Above the break energy the spectrum hardens with time from spectral index of 3.4 to 2.7, and the difference of spectral indices below and above the break energy increases from 1.5 to 5 with time. We, however, note that when $p = 2$ is assumed, a single power-law fitting is also possible with the RHESSI temperature higher than the GOES temperature by ~10 MK. Possible scenarios for the broken-up spectra of the loop-top HXR source are briefly discussed.","Hao Ning, Yao Chen, Jeongwoo Lee, Zhao Wu, Yang Su, Xiang-Liang Kong",No comment found,1906.01284v2,No journal ref found,Xiang-Liang Kong,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01284v2,2019-06-04 09:02:49+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Broken-up Spectra of the Loop-top Hard X-ray Source during a Solar Limb   Flare,2019-06-09 13:20:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01284v2

53,"We present constraints on the reheating era within the string Fibre Inflation scenario, in terms of the effective equation-of-state parameter of the reheating fluid, $w_{reh}$. The results of the analysis, completely independent on the details of the inflaton physics around the vacuum, illustrate the behavior of the number of $e$-foldings during the reheating stage, $N_{reh}$, and of the final reheating temperature, $T_{reh}$, as functions of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. We analyze our results with respect to the current bounds given by the PLANCK mission data and to upcoming cosmological experiments. We find that large values of the equation-of-state parameter ($w_{reh}>1/3$) are particularly favored as the scalar spectral index is of the order of $n_s\sim 0.9680$, with a $\sigma_{n_s}\sim 0.002$ error. Moreover, we compare the behavior of the general reheating functions $N_{reh}$ and $T_{reh}$ in the Fibre Inflation scenario with that extracted by the class of the $\alpha$-attractor models with $\alpha=2$.

55,"We present the first fully relativistic study of gravitational radiation from bodies in circular equatorial orbits around the massive black hole at the Galactic Center, Sgr A* and we assess the detectability of various kinds of objects by the gravitational wave detector LISA. Our computations are based on the theory of perturbations of the Kerr spacetime and take into account the Roche limit induced by tidal forces in the Kerr metric. The signal-to-noise ratio in the LISA detector, as well as the time spent in LISA band, are evaluated. We have implemented all the computational tools in an open-source SageMath package, within the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit framework. We find that white dwarfs, neutrons stars, stellar black holes, primordial black holes of mass larger than $10^{-4} M_\odot$, main-sequence stars of mass lower than $\sim 2.5\, M_\odot$ and brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A* are all detectable in one year of LISA data with a signal-to-noise ratio above 10 during at least $10^5$ years in the slow inspiral towards either the innermost stable circular orbit (compact objects) or the Roche limit (main-sequence stars and brown dwarfs). The longest times in-band, of the order of $10^6$ years, are achieved for primordial black holes of mass $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$ down to $10^{-5} M_\odot$, depending on the spin of Sgr A*, as well as for brown dwarfs, just followed by white dwarfs and low mass main-sequence stars. The long time in-band of these objects makes Sgr A* a valuable target for LISA. We also consider bodies on close circular orbits around the massive black hole in the nucleus of the nearby galaxy M32 and find that, among them, compact objects and brown dwarfs stay for $10^3$ to $10^4$ years in LISA band with a 1-year signal-to-noise ratio above 10.","Eric Gourgoulhon, Alexandre Le Tiec, Frederic H.

56,"In this thesis we will primarily demonstrate how additional scalar degrees of freedom - which are motivated from many high-energy embeddings - open up new observational windows onto the physics of inflation. We construct a Bayesian framework to statistically compare models with additional fields given the current astronomical data. Putting inflation to the test, we perform our analysis on the quadratic curvaton accompanying a range of inflationary potentials, where we find that only one potential remains as a viable candidate. Furthermore, if the curvaton mechanism were to be confirmed by future non-Gaussianity measurements (from large scale structure surveys), the model could prove to be tremendously informative of the early inflationary history. The initial conditions given to these scalar fields become apparent when considering their fundamentally quantum behaviour. Taking this physics into account leads us to develop detailed models for post-inflationary phenomenology (namely, the curvaton and freeze-in dark matter models) and to discover powerful new probes of inflation itself. We further demonstrate how this theoretical study complements our statistical approach by motivating the prior information in our Bayesian analyses. The thesis finishes with a discussion of the future prospects for inflationary model selection. By hypothesising different toy survey configurations, we forecast different outcomes using information theory and our newly developed Bayesian experimental design formalism. In particular, we find that the most likely observable to optimise model selection between single-field inflationary models, through an order of magnitude precision improvement in the future, is the scalar spectral index.

57,"We find that the Hanford and Livingston detectors of Advanced LIGO derive distinct posterior probability distribution of binary tidal deformability tilde{Lambda} of the first binary-neutron-star merger GW170817. By analyzing public data of GW170817 with a nested-sampling engine and the default TaylorF2 waveform provided by the LALInference package, the probability distribution of the binary tidal deformability derived by the LIGO-Virgo detector network turns out to be determined dominantly by the Hanford detector. Specifically, by imposing the flat prior on tidal deformability of individual stars, symmetric 90% credible intervals of tilde{Lambda} are estimated to be 527^{+619}_{-345} with the Hanford detector, 927^{+522}_{-619} with the Livingston detector, and 455^{+668}_{-281} with the LIGO-Virgo detector network. Furthermore, the distribution derived by the Livingston detector changes irregularly when we vary the maximum frequency of the data used in the analysis. This feature is not observed for the Hanford detector. While they are all consistent, the discrepancy and irregular behavior suggest that an in-depth study of noise properties might improve our understanding of GW170817 and future events.","Tatsuya Narikawa, Nami Uchikata, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Masaru Shibata, Hideyuki Tagoshi","8 pages, 3 figures, we reran the analysis with improved power

58,"We study the possibility of singlet fermion dark matter and successful leptogenesis in minimal scotogenic model which also provides a common origin of dark matter and light neutrino masses. In this scenario, where the standard model is extended by three gauge singlet fermions and one additional scalar doublet, all odd under an in-built $Z_2$ symmetry, the lightest singlet fermion which also happens to be the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle, can be either thermal or non-thermal dark matter candidate depending upon the strength of its couplings with standard model leptons and the $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet. In both the scenarios, the $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet plays a non-trivial role either by assisting coannihilation with thermal dark matter or by providing a source for non-thermal dark matter via decay. The heavier $Z_2$ odd singlet fermion produces a net lepton asymmetry through its out-of-equilibrium decay into standard model leptons and $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet. We show that the requirement of producing the observed baryon asymmetry pushes the scale of leptogenesis in case of normal ordering of light neutrino masses to several order of magnitudes above TeV scale. In case of inverted ordering however, it is possible to have successful $N_2$ leptogenesis at a scale of few tens of TeV. Correct dark matter abundance can be realised either by thermal freeze-out or by freeze-in mechanism in different parts of the parameter space that can have interesting prospects for ongoing experiments.","Devabrat Mahanta, Debasish Borah","33 pages, 15 figures",1906.03577v1,No journal ref found,Debasish Borah,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03577v1,2019-06-09 06:34:30+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Fermion Dark Matter with $N_2$ Leptogenesis in Minimal Scotogenic Model,2019-06-09 06:34:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03577v1
59,"Exoplanet catalogs produced by surveys suffer from a lack of completeness (not every planet is detected) and less than perfect reliability (not every planet in the catalog is a true planet). Occurrence rate studies of the exoplanet population structure using such a catalog must be corrected for completeness and reliability. The final Kepler data release, DR25, features a uniformly vetted planet candidate catalog and completeness and reliability products that allow for occurrence rates that are corrected for completeness and reliability. We present a new probabilistic approach to the characterization of Kepler completeness and reliability, making full use of the Kepler DR25 completeness and reliability products. Our approach is robust against sparse data. We illustrate the impact of completeness and reliability using a standard Poisson-likelihood-based occurrence rate method, using a recent stellar properties catalog that incorporates Gaia stellar radii and uniform treatment of the entire stellar population. This is the first exoplanet occurrence rate calculation that makes full use of the DR25 completeness and reliability products. We find that correcting for reliability reduces by a factor of two the occurrence of exoplanets with orbital period and radius within 20% of Earth's around GK dwarf stars, from 0.044+0.021-0.015 to 0.019+0.012-0.008. We also explore alternative occurrence rates, and show that using Gaia-based stellar radii rather than those in the DR25 stellar properties reduces occurrence rates by a factor of two.

60,"In the present paper, we explore various gravitational aspects such as energy extraction, particle collision around $U(1)^2$ dyonic rotating black hole spacetime. The impact parameter of the rotation parameter and the gauge coupling constant on the behaviour of horizon and ergoregion of the black hole is studied. The energy extraction mechanism via Penrose process and superradiant modes is also presented numerically for the black hole. Interestingly, our result indicates that for a strongly coupled extremal black hole under certain constraint, the maximum efficiency for this case becomes almost double while compared with the case of extremal Kerr black hole spacetime in general relativity (GR). Under the same constraint, the maximum amount can be extracted from an extreme black hole which increases with respect to the coupling constant and comes to have an upper bound which is $\sim 60.75 \%$ of its total energy. It is worth noticing that the amount of energy extracted is extremely high as compared to the extreme Kerr black hole spacetime in GR. The limit of energy extraction in terms of the local speeds of the fragments is also examined with the help of the Wald inequality. We identify an upper limit on the gauge coupling constant up to which the phenomenon of Superradiance is likely to occur. We have also computed the energy for the collision of two particles having equal rest mass accelerated by the black hole spacetime in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.","Anik Rudra, Hemwati Nandan, Radouane Gannouji, Soham Chakraborty, Arindam Kumar Chatterjee","17 pages, 11 figures",1906.03566v1,No journal ref found,Arindam Kumar Chatterjee,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03566v1,2019-06-09 04:51:33+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE,"Energy extraction and particle acceleration around a rotating dyonic   black hole in $N=2$, $U(1)^2$ gauged supergravity",2019-06-09 04:51:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03566v1

Stellar velocity dispersions were measured directly from the Mg Ib region, taking into consideration the effect of Fe II contamination, active galactic nucleus (AGN) dilution, and host-galaxy morphology on our measurements. BH masses are estimated using the H$\beta$ line width, and the luminosity at 5100 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$ is estimated from surface brightness decomposition of the AGN from the host galaxy using high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. Additionally, we investigate the use of the [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission line width as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion, finding better correlation once corrected for Fe II contamination and any possible blueshifted wing components. Our selection criteria allowed us to probe lower-luminosity AGNs and lower-mass BHs in the non-local universe than those measured in previous single-epoch studies. We find that any offset in the $M_{\rm{BH}}-\sigma_*$ relation up to $z\sim0.6$ is consistent with the scatter of local BH masses, and address the sources of biases and uncertainties that contribute to this scatter.","Remington O.

62,"Planets similar to Earth - but slightly more irradiated - are expected to enter into a runaway greenhouse state, where all surface water rapidly evaporates, forming an optically thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for a ~6% increase only of the solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-size, temperate planets. Using 1-D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for thick, hot water vapour-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of % of Earth radius). This abrupt radius inflation - resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced transition - could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions such as TESS, CHEOPS and PLATO (combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements with ground-based spectrographs such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES or SPIRou), or even in particular cases in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1 (when masses and radii will be known with good enough precision). This result provides the community with an observational test of (1) the concept of runaway greenhouse, that defines the inner edge of the traditional Habitable Zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse.

The CO (6--5) emission was detected in most of the outflow lobes in the mapped regions, while the CO (7--6) was found mostly from the OMC-3 outflows. In the OMC-3 MMS 5 outflow, a previously undetected extremely high velocity gas was found in CO (6--5). This extremely high velocity emission arises from the regions close to the central object MMS 5. Radiative transfer models revealed that the high-velocity gas from MMS 5 outflow consists of gas with $n_{\rm H_2}=$10$^4$--10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T>$ 200 K, similar to what is observed in young Class 0 low-mass protostars. For the other outflows, values of $n_{\rm H_2}>$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ were found. The physical conditions and kinematic properties of the young intermediate-mass outflows presented here are similar to those found in outflows from Class 0 low-mass objects. Due to their excitation requirements, mid$-J$ CO lines are good tracers of extremely high velocity gas in young outflows likely related to jets.","A. I. Gómez-Ruiz, A. Gusdorf, S. Leurini, K. M.

64,"For extremely large telescopes, adaptive optics will be required to correct the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The performance of tomographic adaptive optics is strongly dependent on the vertical distribution (profile) of this turbulence. An important way in which this manifests is the tomographic error, arising from imperfect measurement and reconstruction of the turbulent phase at altitude. Conventionally, a small number of reference profiles are used to obtain this error in simulation however these profiles are not constructed to be representative in terms of tomographic error. It is therefore unknown whether these simulations are providing realistic performance estimates. Here, we employ analytical adaptive optics simulation that drastically reduces computation times to compute tomographic error for 10 691 measurements of the turbulence profile gathered by the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at ESO Paranal. We assess for the first time the impact of the profile on tomographic error in a statistical manner. We find, in agreement with previous work, that the tomographic error is most directly linked with the distribution of turbulence into discrete, stratified layers. Reference profiles are found to provide mostly higher tomographic error than expected, which we attribute to the fact that these profiles are primarily composed of averages of many measurements resulting in unrealistic, continuous distributions of turbulence. We propose that a representative profile should be defined with respect to a particular system, and that as such simulations with a large statistical sample of profiles must be an important step in the design process.","O.

65,"Flat rotation curves in disk galaxies represent the main evidence for large amounts of surrounding dark matter. Despite of the difficulty in identifying the dark matter contribution to the total mass density in our Galaxy, stellar kinematics, as tracer of gravitational potential, is the most reliable observable for gauging different matter components. This work tests the flatness of the MW rotation curve with a simple general relativistic model suitable to represent the geometry of a disk as a stationary axisymmetric dust metric at a sufficiently large distance from a central body. Circular velocities of unprecedented accuracy were derived from the Gaia DR2 data for a carefully selected sample of disk stars. We then fit these velocities to both the classical, i.e. including a dark matter halo, rotation curve model and a relativistic analogue, as derived form the solution of Einstein's equation. The GR-compliant MW rotational curve model results statistically indistinguishable from its state-of-the-art DM analogue. This supports our ansatz that a stationary and axisymmetric galaxy-scale metric could ""fill the gap"" in a baryons-only Milky Way, suggestive of star orbits dragged along the background geometry. We confirmed that geometry is a manifestation of gravity according to the Einstein theory, in particular the weak gravitational effect due to the off-diagonal term of the metric could mimic for a ""DM-like"" effect in the observed flatness of the MW rotation curve. In the context of Local Cosmology, our findings are suggestive of a Galaxy phase-space as the exterior gravitational field of a Kerr-like source (inner rotating bulge) without the need of extra-matter.","Mariateresa Crosta, Marco Giammaria, Mario G.

66,"We present post-jet-break \textit{HST}, VLA and \textit{Chandra} observations of the afterglow of the long $\gamma$-ray bursts GRB 160625B (between 69 and 209 days) and GRB 160509A (between 35 and 80 days). We calculate the post-jet-break decline rates of the light curves, and find the afterglow of GRB 160625B inconsistent with a simple $t^{-3/4}$ steepening over the break, expected from the geometric effect of the jet edge entering our line of sight. However, the favored optical post-break decline ($f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1.96 \pm 0.07}$) is also inconsistent with the $f_{\nu} \propto t^{-p}$ decline (where $p \approx 2.3$ from the pre-break light curve), which is expected from exponential lateral expansion of the jet; perhaps suggesting lateral expansion that only affects a fraction of the jet. The post-break decline of GRB 160509A is consistent with both the $t^{-3/4}$ steepening and with $f_{\nu} \propto t^{-p}$. We also use {\sc boxfit} to fit afterglow models to both light curves and find both to be energetically consistent with a millisecond magnetar central engine, although the magnetar parameters need to be extreme (i.e. $E \sim 3 \times 10^{52}$ erg). Finally, the late-time radio behavior of either afterglow -- well represented by a single power law decline (roughly $f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1}$) with no breaks -- cannot be reproduced well by {\sc boxfit} and is inconsistent with predictions from the standard jet model. This requires a highly chromatic jet break ($t_{j,\mathrm{radio}} > 10 \times t_{j,\mathrm{optical}}$) and possibly a two-component jet for both bursts.","Tuomas Kangas, Andrew S. Fruchter, S.

67,"We present a study of unusually bright single pulses (BSPs) from a millisecond pulsar in an ablating binary system, B1744-24A, based on several multi-orbit observations with the Green Bank Telescope. These pulses come predominantly in time near eclipse ingress and egress, have intensities up to 40 times the average pulse intensity, and pulse widths similar to that of the average pulse profile. The average intensity, spectral index of radio emission, and the dispersion measure do not vary in connection with BSP outbursts. The average profile obtained from BSPs has the same shape as the average profile from all pulses. These properties make it difficult to explain BSPs via scintillation in the interstellar medium, as a separate emission mode, or as conventional giant pulses. BSPs from B1744-24A have similar properties to the strong pulses observed from the Black Widow binary pulsar B1957+10, which were recently attributed to strong lensing by the intrabinary material (Main et al. 2018). We argue that the strong lensing likely occurs in B1744-24A as well. For this system, the sizes and locations of the lenses are not well constrained by simple 1D lensing models from Cordes et al. (2017) and Main et al. (2018).

68,"According to a recent investigation, an estimated 33-50% of the world's coral reefs have undergone degradation, believed to be as a result of climate change. A strong driver of climate change and the subsequent environmental impact are greenhouse gases such as methane. However, the exact relation climate change has to the environmental condition cannot be easily established. Remote sensing methods are increasingly being used to quantify and draw connections between rapidly changing climatic conditions and environmental impact. A crucial part of this analysis is processing spectroscopy data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) which is a computationally expensive process and limits their use with high volume imaging spectrometers. This work presents an algorithm that can efficiently emulate RTMs using neural networks leading to a multifold speedup in processing time, and yielding multiple downstream benefits.","Shubhankar Deshpande, Brian D.

69,"We derive a model for Sunyaev--Zel'dovich data from a galaxy cluster which uses an Einasto profile to model the cluster's dark matter component. This model is similar to the physical models for clusters previously used by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) consortium, which model the dark matter using a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, but the Einasto profile provides an extra degree of freedom. We thus present a comparison between two physical models which differ only in the way they model dark matter: one which uses an NFW profile (PM I) and one that uses an Einasto profile (PM II). We illustrate the differences between the models by plotting physical properties of clusters as a function of cluster radius. We generate AMI simulations of clusters which are \textit{created} and \textit{analysed} with both models. From this we find that for 14 of the 16 simulations, the Bayesian evidence gives no preference to either of the models according to the Jeffreys scale, and for the other two simulations, weak preference in favour of the correct model. However, for the mass estimates obtained from the analyses, the values were within $1\sigma$ of the input values for 14 out of 16 of the clusters when using the correct model, but only in 6 out of 16 cases when the incorrect model was used to analyse the data. Finally we apply the models to real data from cluster A611 obtained with AMI, and find the mass estimates to be consistent with one another except in the case of when PM II is applied using an extreme value for the Einasto shape parameter.","Kamran Javid, Yvette C.

70,"Metropolis nested sampling evolves a Markov chain from a current livepoint and accepts new points along the chain according to a version of the Metropolis acceptance ratio modified to satisfy the likelihood constraint, characteristic of nested sampling algorithms. The geometric nested sampling algorithm we present here is a based on the Metropolis method, but treats parameters as though they represent points on certain geometric objects, namely circles, tori and spheres. For parameters which represent points on a circle or torus, the trial distribution is `wrapped' around the domain of the posterior distribution such that samples cannot be rejected automatically when evaluating the Metropolis ratio due to being outside the sampling domain. Furthermore, this enhances the mobility of the sampler. For parameters which represent coordinates on the surface of a sphere, the algorithm transforms the parameters into a Cartesian coordinate system before sampling which again makes sure no samples are automatically rejected, and provides a physically intutive way of the sampling the parameter space. \\ We apply the geometric nested sampler to two types of toy model which include circular, toroidal and spherical parameters. We find that the geometric nested sampler generally outperforms \textsc{MultiNest} in both cases. \\ %We also apply the algorithm to a gravitational wave detection model which includes circular and spherical parameters, and find that the geometric nested sampler and \textsc{MultiNest} appear to perform equally well as one another.

71,"We investigate how the detectability of signatures of self-gravity in a protoplanetary disc depends on its temporal evolution. We run a one-dimensional model for secular timescales to follow the disc mass as a function of time. We then combine this with three-dimensional global hydrodynamics simulations that employ a hybrid radiative transfer method to approximate realistic heating and cooling. We simulate ALMA continuum observations of these systems, and find that structures induced by the gravitational instability (GI) are readily detectable when $q=M_\mathrm{disc}/M_*\gtrsim 0.25$ and $R_\mathrm{outer}\lesssim 100$ au. The high accretion rate generated by gravito-turbulence in such a massive disc drains its mass to below the detection threshold in $\sim10^4$ years, or approximately 1 % of the typical disc lifetime. Therefore, discs with spiral arms detected in ALMA dust observations, if generated by self-gravity, must either be still receiving infall to maintain a high $q$ value, or have just emerged from their natal envelope. Detection of substructure in systems with lower $q$ is possible, but would require a specialist integration with the most extended configuration over several days. This disfavours the possibility of GI-caused spiral structure in systems with $q<0.25$ being detected in relatively short integration times, such as those found in the DSHARP ALMA survey (Andrews et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2018).

72,"One of the most significant advances by NASA's ${\mathit Kepler}$ Mission was the discovery of an abundant new population of highly irradiated planets with sizes between the Earth and Neptune. Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5 Earth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky super-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile envelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will be critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky super-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have lost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes, or they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets, which never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric photo-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated cores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys push to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller less massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets formed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without initial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet formation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital period, due to the increasing solid mass available in their disks. Moreover, we show that distinguishing between these two scenarios should be possible in coming years with radial velocity follow-up of planets found by TESS. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this work for current efforts to measure $\eta_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$, which may yield significant overestimates if most rocky planets form as evaporated cores.","Eric D.

73,"We present a self-consistent Bayesian formalism to sample the primordial density fields compatible with a set of dark matter density tracers after cosmic evolution observed in redshift space. Previous works on density reconstruction did not self-consistently consider redshift space distortions or included an additional iterative distortion correction step. We present here the analytic solution of coherent flows within a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo posterior sampling of the primordial density field. We test our method within the Zel'dovich approximation, presenting also an analytic solution including tidal fields and spherical collapse on small scales using augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory. Our resulting reconstructed fields are isotropic and their power spectra are unbiased compared to the true one defined by our mock observations. Novel algorithmic implementations are introduced regarding the mass assignment kernels when defining the dark matter density field and optimization of the time step in the Hamiltonian equations of motions. Our algorithm, dubbed barcode, promises to be specially suited for analysis of the dark matter cosmic web down to scales of a few Megaparsecs. This large scale structure is implied by the observed spatial distribution of galaxy clusters --- such as obtained from X-ray, SZ or weak lensing surveys --- as well as that of the intergalactic medium sampled by the Lyman alpha forest or perhaps even by deep hydrogen intensity mapping. In these cases, virialized motions are negligible, and the tracers cannot be modeled as point-like objects. It could be used in all of these contexts as a baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction algorithm.","E. G. Patrick Bos, Francisco-Shu Kitaura, Rien van de Weygaert","34 pages, 25 figures, 1 table.

74,"Aims: We study the characteristics of intermediate drift bursts (fibers) embedded in the July 14, 2000 large solar event. Methods: We used dynamic spectra from the acousto-optic analyzer (SAO) of the ARTEMIS-JLS solar radiospectrograph, in conjunction with high time resolution images from the Nanc cay Radioheliograph (NRH) and EUV images from TRACE . We computed both 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional images and applied high pass time filtering to the images and the dynamic spectrum in order to enhance the fibers. For the study of the background continuum emission we used images averaged over several seconds. Results: All fibers in the SAO dynamic spectra are identifiable in the NRH images. Fibers were first detected after the primary energy release in a moving type IV, probably associated with the rapid eastward expansion of the flare and the postflare loop arcade. They appeared as a 10% modulation of the continuum intensity. The fibers and the continuum were strongly circularly polarized in the ordinary mode sense, indicating fundamental plasma emission. We detected discrete fiber sources along two ~300, Mm long parallel stripes, apparently segments of large scale loops encompassing both the EUV loops and the flux rope. We found multiple fiber emissions at slightly different positions and times; their consecutive appearance can give the impression of apparent motion with supra-luminal velocities. Images of individual fibers were very similar at 432.0 and 327.0 MHz. From the position shift of the sources and the time delays at low and high frequencies we estimated, for a well observed group of fibers, the exciter speed and the frequency scale length along the loops; we obtained consistent values from imaging and spectral data, supporting the whistler origin of the fiber emission. The fibers in absorption and in emission are very similar as manifestations of the same wave train.","C. E. Alissandrakis, C. Bouratzis, A.

75,"The dependence of polarization fraction $p$ on total intensity $I$ in polarized submillimeter emission measurements is typically parameterized as $p\propto I^{-\alpha}$ $(\alpha \leq 1)$, and used to infer dust grain alignment efficiency in star-forming regions, with an index $\alpha=1$ indicating near-total lack of alignment of grains with the magnetic field. In this work we demonstrate that the non-Gaussian noise characteristics of polarization fraction may produce apparent measurements of $\alpha \sim 1$ even in data with significant signal-to-noise in Stokes $Q$, $U$ and $I$ emission, and so with robust measurements of polarization angle. We present a simple model demonstrating this behavior, and propose a criterion by which well-characterized measurements of polarization fraction may be identified. We demonstrate that where our model is applicable, $\alpha$ can be recovered by fitting the $p-I$ relationship with the mean of the Rice distribution, without statistical debiasing of polarization fraction. We apply our model to JCMT BISTRO Survey POL-2 850$\mu$m observations of three clumps in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud, finding that in the externally-illuminated Oph A region, $\alpha\approx 0.34$, while in the more isolated Oph B and C, despite their differing star formation histories, $\alpha \sim 0.6-0.7$. Our results thus suggest that dust grain alignment in dense gas is more strongly influenced by incident interstellar radiation field than by star formation history. We further find that grains may remain aligned with the magnetic field at significantly higher gas densities than has previously been believed, thus allowing investigation of magnetic field properties within star-forming clumps and cores.","Kate Pattle, Shih-Ping Lai, Tetsuo Hasegawa, Jia-Wei Wang, Ray Furuya, Derek Ward-Thompson, Pierre Bastien, Simon Coudé, Chakali Eswaraiah, Lapo Fanciullo, James di Francesco, Thiem Hoang, Gwanjeong Kim, Woojin Kwon, Chang Won Lee, Sheng-Yuan Liu, Tie Liu, Masafumi Matsumura, Takashi Onaka, Sarah Sadavoy, Archana Soam","21 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ",1906.03391v1,No journal ref found,Archana Soam,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03391v1,2019-06-08 05:07:36+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,JCMT BISTRO Survey observations of the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud: Dust   grain alignment properties inferred using a Ricean noise model,2019-06-08 05:07:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03391v1

We implement active-sterile neutrino oscillations in a steady-state model of this neutrino-driven wind to study their effects on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of the wind in a self-consistent manner. Using vacuum mixing parameters indicated by some experiments for a sterile $\nu_s$ of $\sim 1$ eV in mass, we observe interesting features of oscillations due to various feedback. For the higher $\nu_s$ mass values, we find that oscillations can reduce the mass loss rate and the wind velocity by a factor of $\sim 1.6$--2.7 and change the electron fraction critical to nucleosynthesis by a significant to large amount. In the most dramatic cases, oscillations shifts nucleosynthesis from dominant production of $^{45}$Sc to that of $^{86}$Kr and $^{90}$Zr during the early epochs of the CCSN evolution.","Zewei Xiong, Meng-Ru Wu, Yong-Zhong Qian","18 pages, 13 figures",1904.09371v2,No journal ref found,Yong-Zhong Qian,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09371v2,2019-04-19 23:31:19+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Active-sterile Neutrino Oscillations in Neutrino-driven Winds:   Implications for Nucleosynthesis,2019-06-08 00:14:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09371v2
78,"We present an algorithm that uses the distribution of photon arrival times to distinguish speckles from incoherent sources, like planets and disks, in high contrast images. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can overcome the noise limit from fluctuating speckle intensity. The algorithm is likely to be most advantageous when a coronagraph limits the coherent diffraction pattern in the image plane but the intensity is still strongly modulated by fast-timescale uncorrected stellar light, for example from atmospheric turbulence. These conditions are common at small inner working angles and will allow probing of exoplanet populations at smaller angular separations. The technique requires a fast science camera that can temporally resolve the speckle fluctuations, and the detection of many photons per speckle decorrelation time. Since the algorithm directly extracts the incoherent light, standard differential imaging post-processing techniques can be performed afterwards to further boost the signal.","Alex B.

79,"Despite mounting evidence that astrophysical dark matter exists in the Universe, its fundamental nature remains unknown. In this paper, we present the prospects to detect and identify dark matter particles through the observation of very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$ TeV) gamma-rays coming from the annihilation or decay of these particles in the Galactic halo. The observation of the the Galactic Center and a large fraction of the halo by a future wide field-of-view gamma-ray observatory located in the southern hemisphere would reach unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles in the mass range of $\sim$500 GeV to $\sim$2 PeV. Combined with other gamma-ray observatories (present and future) a thermal relic annihilation cross-section could be probed for all particle masses from $\sim$80 TeV down to the GeV range in most annihilation channels.","Aion Viana, Harm Schoorlemmer, Andrea Albert, Vitor de Souza, J.

80,"To adequately constrain the frequency of energy deposition in active region cores in the solar corona, systematic comparisons between detailed models and observational data are needed. In this paper, we describe a pipeline for forward modeling active region emission using magnetic field extrapolations and field-aligned hydrodynamic models. We use this pipeline to predict time-dependent emission from active region NOAA 1158 as observed by SDO/AIA for low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency nanoflares. In each pixel of our predicted multi-wavelength, time-dependent images, we compute two commonly-used diagnostics: the emission measure slope and the time lag. We find that signatures of the heating frequency persist in both of these diagnostics. In particular, our results show that the distribution of emission measure slopes narrows and the mean decreases with decreasing heating frequency and that the range of emission measure slopes is consistent with past observational and modeling work. Furthermore, we find that the time lag becomes increasingly spatially coherent with decreasing heating frequency while the distribution of time lags across the whole active region becomes more broad with increasing heating frequency. In a follow up paper, we train a random forest classifier on these predicted diagnostics and use this model to classify real AIA observations of NOAA 1158 in terms of the underlying heating frequency.","W.

81,"We argue that a genuine image of the black hole viewed by a distant observer is not its shadow, but a more compact event horizon image probed by the luminous matter plunging into black hole. The external border of the black hole shadow is washed out by radiation from matter plunging into black hole and approaching the event horizon. This effect will crucially influence the results of future observations by the Event Horizon Telescope. We show that gravitational lensing of the luminous matter plunging into black hole provides the possibility for visualization of the event horizon. The lensed image of the event horizon is formed by the highly red-shifted photons emitted by the plunging matter very near the black hole event horizon and detected by a distant observer. The resulting event horizon image is a gravitationally lensed projection on the celestial sphere of the whole black hole event horizon sphere. Seemingly, black holes are the unique objects in the Universe which may be viewed by distant observers at once from both the front and back sides.","V. I. Dokuchaev, N. O.

We introduce a new method using a combined ranking statistic to detect sources that do not produce significant gravitational-wave or gamma-ray burst candidates individually. The current version of this search can increase by 70% the detections of joint gravitational-wave and gamma-ray signals. We find one possible candidate observed by LIGO and Fermi-GBM, 1-OGC 151030, at a false alarm rate of 1 in 13 years. If astrophysical, this candidate would correspond to a merger at $187^{+99}_{-87}\,$Mpc with source-frame chirp mass of $1.30^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. If we assume the viewing angle must be $<30^{\circ}$ to be observed by \textit{Fermi}-GBM, our estimate of the distance would become $224^{+88}_{-78}\,$Mpc.

Experiments at such extreme conditions are challenging, often resulting in hard-to-interpret and controversial observations. We present a theoretical study of the phase diagram of dense hydrogen, using machine learning to overcome time and length scale limitations while describing accurately interatomic forces. We reproduce the re-entrant melting behavior and the polymorphism of the solid phase. In simulations based on the machine learning potential we find evidence for continuous metallization in the liquid, as a first-order liquid-liquid transition is pre-empted by freezing. This suggests a smooth transition between insulating and metallic layers in giant gas planets, and reconciles existing discrepancies between experiments as a manifestation of supercritical behavior.","Bingqing Cheng, Guglielmo Mazzola, Michele Ceriotti",No comment found,1906.03341v1,No journal ref found,Michele Ceriotti,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03341v1,2019-06-07 21:56:39+00:00,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mtrl-sci|astro-ph.EP,Evidence for supercritical behavior of high-pressure liquid hydrogen,2019-06-07 21:56:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03341v1
85,"The solar atmosphere is dominated by loops of magnetic flux which connect the multi-million-degree corona to the much cooler chromosphere. The temperature and density structure of quasi-static loops is determined by the continuous flow of energy from the hot corona to the lower solar atmosphere. Loop scaling laws provide relationships between global properties of the loop (such as peak temperature, pressure, and length); they follow from the physical variable dependencies of various terms in the energy equation, and hence the form of the loop scaling law provides insight into the key physics that controls the loop structure. Traditionally, scaling laws have been derived under the assumption of collision-dominated thermal conduction. Here we examine the impact of different regimes of thermal conduction -- collision-dominated, turbulence-dominated, and free-streaming -- on the form of the scaling laws relating the loop temperature and heating rate to its pressure and half-length. We show that the scaling laws for turbulence-dominated conduction are fundamentally different than those for collision-dominated and free-streaming conduction, inasmuch as the form of the scaling laws now depend primarily on conditions at the low-temperature, rather than high-temperature, part of the loop. We also establish regimes in temperature and density space in which each of the applicable scaling laws prevail.","Stephen J. Bradshaw, A. Gordon Emslie, Nicolas H. Bian, Eduard P.

86,"On 2019 April 25.346 and 26.640 UT the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave (GW) observatories announced the detection of the first candidate events in Observing Run 3 that contain at least one neutron star. S190425z is a likely binary neutron star (BNS) merger at $d_L = 156 \pm 41$ Mpc, while S190426c is possibly the first NS-BH merger ever detected, at $d_L = 377 \pm 100$ Mpc, although with marginal statistical significance. Here we report our optical follow-up observations for both events using the MMT 6.5-m telescope, as well as our spectroscopic follow-up of candidate counterparts (which turned out to be unrelated) with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope. We compare to publicly reported searches, explore the overall areal coverage and depth, and evaluate those in relation to the optical/NIR kilonova emission from the BNS merger GW170817, to theoretical kilonova models, and to short GRB afterglows. We find that for a GW170817-like kilonova, the partial volume covered spans up to about 40% for S190425z and 60% for S190426c. For an on-axis jet typical of short GRBs, the search effective volume is larger, but such a configuration is expected in at most a few percent of mergers. We further find that wide-field $\gamma$-ray and X-ray limits rule out luminous on-axis SGRBs, for a large fraction of the localization regions, although these searches are not sufficiently deep in the context of the $\gamma$-ray emission from GW170817 or off-axis SGRB afterglows. The results indicate that some optical follow-up searches are sufficiently deep for counterpart identification to about 300 Mpc, but that localizations better than 1000 deg$^2$ are likely essential.","G.

We investigate the validity of the claim that invokes two extreme exoplanetary system candidates around the pulsating B-type subdwarfs KIC 10001893 and KIC 5807616 from the primary $\it{Kepler}$ field.   $\bf{Aims}$. Our goal was to find characteristics and the source of weak signals that are observed in these subdwarf light curves.   $\bf{Methods}$. To achieve this, we analyzed short- and long-cadence $\it{Kepler}$ data of the two stars by means of a Fourier transform and compared the results to Fourier transforms of simulated light curves to which we added exoplanetary signals. The long-cadence data of KIC 10001893 were extracted from CCD images of a nearby star, KIC 10001898, using a point spread function reduction technique.   $\bf{Results}$. It appears that the amplitudes of the Fourier transform signals that were found in the low-frequency region depend on the methods that are used to extract and prepare $\it{Kepler}$ data. We demonstrate that using a comparison star for space telescope data can significantly reduce artifacts. Our simulations also show that a weak signal of constant amplitude and frequency, added to a stellar light curve, conserves its frequency in Fourier transform amplitude spectra to within 0.03 $\mu$Hz.   $\bf{Conclusions}$. Based on our simulations, we conclude that the two low-frequency Fourier transform signals found in KIC 5807616 are likely the combined frequencies of the lower amplitude pulsating modes of the star. In the case of KIC 10001893, the signal amplitudes that are visible in the light curve depend on the data set and reduction methods. The strongest signal decreases significantly in amplitude when KIC 10001898 is used as a comparison star. Finally, we recommend that the signal detection threshold is increased to 5 $\sigma$ (or higher) for a Fourier transform analysis of $\it{Kepler}$ data in low-frequency regions.","A. Blokesz, J.

88,"Hemispherical power asymmetry has emerged as a new challenge to cosmology in early universe. While the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements indicated the asymmetry amplitude $A \simeq 0.07$ at the CMB scale $k_{\rm CMB}\simeq 0.0045\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, the high-redshift quasar observations found no significant deviation from statistical isotropy. This conflict can be reconciled in some scale-dependent asymmetry models. We put forward a new parameterization of scale-dependent asymmetric power spectrum, inspired by a multi-speed inflation model. The 21-cm power spectrum from the epoch of reionization can be used to constrain the scale-dependent hemispherical asymmetry. We demonstrate that an optimum, multi-frequency observation by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Phase 2 can impose a constraint on the amplitude of the power asymmetry anomaly at the level of $\Delta A \simeq 0.2$ at $0.056 \lesssim k_{\rm 21cm} \lesssim 0.15 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

89,"By adopting empirical estimates of the Helium enhancement (Delta Y) between consecutive stellar generations for a sample of Galactic globular clusters (GGC), we uniquely constraint the star formation efficiency of each stellar generation in these stellar systems. In our approach, the star formation efficiency is the central factor that links stellar generations as it defines both their stellar mass and the remaining mass available for further star formation, fixing also the amount of matter required to contaminate the next stellar generation. In this way, the star formation efficiency is here shown to be fully defined by the He enhancement between successive stellar generations in a GC.   Our approach has also an impact on the evolution of clusters and thus considers the possible loss of stars through evaporation, tidal interactions and stellar evolution. We focus on the present mass ratio between consecutive stellar generations and the present total mass of Galactic globular clusters. Such considerations suffice to determine the relative proportion of stars of consecutive generations that remain today in globular clusters. The latter is also shown to directly depend on the values of Delta Y and thus the He enhancement between consecutive stellar generations in GGC places major constraints on models of star formation and evolution of GC.","Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle, Sergiy Silich, Jan Palous, Casiana Muñoz-Tuñón, Richard Wunsch","19 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical

90,"A massive $U(1)^{\prime}$ gauge boson known as a ""dark photon"" or $A^{\prime}$, has long been proposed as a potential explanation for the discrepancy observed between the experimental measurement and theoretical determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, ($g_{\mu} - 2$) anomaly. Recently, experimental results have excluded this possibility for a dark photon exhibiting exclusively visible or invisible decays. In this work, we revisit this idea and consider a model where $A^{\prime}$ couples inelastically to dark matter and an excited dark sector state, leading to a more exotic decay topology we refer to as a semi-visible decay. We show that for large mass splittings between the dark sector states this decay mode is enhanced, weakening the previous invisibly decaying dark photon bounds. As a consequence, $A^{\prime}$ resolves the $g_{\mu} - 2$ anomaly in a region of parameter space the thermal dark matter component of the Universe is readily explained. Interestingly, it is possible that the semi-visible events we discuss may have been vetoed by experiments searching for invisible dark photon decays. A re-analysis of the data and future searches may be crucial in uncovering this exotic decay mode or closing the window on the dark photon explanation of the $g_{\mu} - 2$ anomaly.",Gopolang Mohlabeng,"5 pages + references, 3 figures",1902.05075v2,No journal ref found,Gopolang Mohlabeng,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05075v2,2019-02-13 19:00:01+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-ex,Revisiting the Dark Photon Explanation of the Muon Anomalous Magnetic   Moment,2019-06-07 19:02:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05075v2
91,"A set of eight self-consistent, time-dependent supernova (SN) simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D) for 9 solar-mass and 20 solar-mass progenitors is evaluated for the presence of dipolar asymmetries of the electron lepton-number emission as discovered by Tamborra et al. and termed lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). The simulations were performed with the Aenus-Alcar neutrino/hydrodynamics code, which treats the energy- and velocity-dependent transport of neutrinos of all flavors by a two-moment scheme with algebraic M1 closure. For each of the progenitors, results with fully multi-dimensional (FMD) neutrino transport and with ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+) approximation are considered for two different grid resolutions. While the 9 solar-mass models develop explosions, the 20 solar-mass progenitor does not explode with the employed version of simplified neutrino opacities. In all 3D models we observe the growth of substantial dipole amplitudes of the lepton-number (electron neutrino minus antineutrino) flux with stable or slowly time-evolving direction and overall properties fully consistent with the LESA phenomenon. Models with RbR+ transport develop LESA dipoles somewhat faster and with temporarily higher amplitudes, but the FMD calculations exhibit cleaner hemispheric asymmetries with a far more dominant dipole. In contrast, the RbR+ results display much wider multipole spectra of the neutrino-emission anisotropies with significant power also in the quadrupole and higher-order modes. Our results disprove speculations that LESA is a numerical artifact of RbR+ transport. We also discuss LESA as consequence of a dipolar convection flow inside of the nascent neutron star and establish, tentatively, a connection to Chandrasekhar's linear theory of thermal instability in spherical shells.","Robert Glas, H. -Thomas Janka, Tobias Melson, Georg Stockinger, Oliver Just","20 pages, 9 figures; revised version accepted by ApJ; new Figs. 6,7,

92,"Magnetic reconnection is often invoked to explain the non-thermal radiation of relativistic outflows, including jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the largely unknown plasma composition of AGN jets, we study reconnection in the unexplored regime of electron-positron-proton (pair-proton) plasmas with large-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We cover a wide range of pair multiplicities (lepton-to-proton number ratio $\kappa=1-199$) for different values of the all-species plasma magnetization ($\sigma=1,3$ and 10) and electron temperature ($\Theta_e\equiv kT_e/m_ec^2=0.1-100$). We focus on the dependence of the post-reconnection energy partition and lepton energy spectra on the hot pair plasma magnetization $\sigma_{e,h}$ (i.e., the ratio of magnetic to pair enthalpy densities). We find that the post-reconnection energy is shared roughly equally between magnetic fields, pairs, and protons for $\sigma_{e,h}\gtrsim 3$. We empirically find that the mean lepton Lorentz factor in the post-reconnection region depends on $\sigma, \Theta_e$, and $\sigma_{e,h}$ as $\langle \gamma_e-1\rangle \approx \sqrt{\sigma}(1+4\Theta_e)\left(1+\sigma_{e,h}/30\right)$, for $\sigma\ge1$. The high-energy part of the post-reconnection lepton energy distributions can be described by a power law, whose slope is mainly controlled by $\sigma_{e,h}$ for $\kappa \gtrsim 3-6$, with harder power laws obtained for higher magnetizations. We finally show that reconnection in pair-proton plasmas with multiplicities $\kappa \sim 1-20$, magnetizations $\sigma \sim 1-10$, and temperatures $\Theta_e \sim 1-10$ results in particle power law slopes and average electron Lorentz factors that are consistent with those inferred in leptonic models of AGN jet emission.","Maria Petropoulou, Lorenzo Sironi, Anatoly Spitkovsky, Dimitrios Giannios","25 pages, 23 figures, 4 tables.

93,"In this work we present a new hybrid method to simulate the thermal effects of the reionization in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The method improves upon the standard approach used in simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxy formation without a significant increase of the computational cost allowing for efficient exploration of the parameter space. The method uses a small set of phenomenological input parameters and combines a semi-numerical reionization model to solve for the topology of reionization and an approximate model of how reionization heats the IGM, with the massively parallel \texttt{Nyx} hydrodynamics code, specifically designed to solve for the structure of diffuse IGM gas. We have produced several large-scale high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ($2048^3$, $L_{\rm box} = 40$ Mpc/h) with different instantaneous and inhomogeneous HI reionization models that use this new methodology. We study the IGM thermal properties of these models and find that large scale temperature fluctuations extend well beyond the end of reionization. Analyzing the 1D flux power spectrum of these models, we find up to $\sim 50\%$ differences in the large scale properties (low modes, $k\lesssim0.01$ s/km) of the post-reionization power spectrum due to the thermal fluctuations. We show that these differences could allow one to distinguish between different reionization scenarios already with existing Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Finally, we explore the differences in the small-scale cutoff of the power spectrum and we find that, for the same heat input, models show very good agreement provided that the reionization redshift of the instantaneous reionization model happens at the midpoint of the inhomogeneous model.","Jose Oñorbe, F.

94,"Intensity mapping has emerged as a promising tool to probe the three-dimensional structure of the universe. The traditional approach of galaxy redshift surveys is based on individual galaxy detection, typically performed by thresholding and digitizing large-scale intensity maps. By contrast, intensity mapping uses the integrated emission from all sources in a 3D pixel (or voxel) as an analog tracer of large-scale structure. In this work, we develop a formalism to quantify the performance of both approaches when measuring large-scale structures. We compute the Fisher information of an arbitrary observable, derive the optimal estimator, and study its performance as a function of source luminosity function, survey resolution, instrument sensitivity, and other survey parameters. We identify regimes where each approach is advantageous and discuss optimal strategies for different scenarios. To determine the best strategy for any given survey, we develop a metric that is easy to compute from the source luminosity function and the survey sensitivity, and we demonstrate the application with several planned intensity mapping surveys.","Yun-Ting Cheng, Roland de Putter, Tzu-Ching Chang, Olivier Dore","21 pages, 15 figures, accepted by ApJ",1809.06384v2,No journal ref found,Olivier Dore,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06384v2,2018-09-17 18:00:10+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Optimally Mapping Large-Scale Structures with Luminous Sources,2019-06-07 18:39:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06384v2
95,"We present the discovery of KELT-24 b, a massive hot Jupiter orbiting a bright (V=8.3 mag, K=7.2 mag) young F-star with a period of 5.6 days. The host star, KELT-24 (HD 93148), has a $T_{\rm eff}$ =$6508\pm49$ K, a mass of $M_{*}$ = $1.461^{+0.056}_{-0.060}$ $M_{\odot}$, radius of $R_{*}$ = $1.506\pm0.022$ $R_{\odot}$, and an age of $0.77^{+0.61}_{-0.42}$ Gyr. Its planetary companion (KELT-24 b) has a radius of $R_{\rm P}$ = $1.272^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$ $R_{\rm J}$, a mass of $M_{\rm P}$ = $5.18^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ $M_{\rm J}$, and from Doppler tomographic observations, we find that the planet's orbit is well-aligned to its host star's projected spin axis ($\lambda$ = $2.6^{+5.1}_{-3.6}$). The young age estimated for KELT-24 suggests that it only recently started to evolve from the zero-age main sequence. KELT-24 is the brightest star known to host a transiting giant planet with a period between 5 and 10 days. Although the circularization timescale is much longer than the age of the system, we do not detect a large eccentricity or significant misalignment that is expected from dynamical migration. The brightness of its host star and its moderate surface gravity make KELT-24b an intriguing target for detailed atmospheric characterization through spectroscopic emission measurements since it would bridge the current literature results that have primarily focused on lower mass hot Jupiters and a few brown dwarfs.","Joseph E.

96,"Discoveries of low mass galaxy pairs and groups are increasing. Studies indicate that dwarf galaxy pairs are gas rich in the field and exhibit elevated star formation rates, suggestive of interactions. Lacking are dynamical models of observed dwarf galaxy pairs to disentangle the physical processes regulating their baryon cycles. We present new optical data and the first detailed theoretical model of an observed tidal encounter between two isolated low mass galaxies, NGC 4490 & NGC 4485. This system is an isolated analog of the Magellanic Clouds and is surrounded by a ~50 kpc extended HI envelope. We use hybrid $N$-body and test-particle simulations along with a visualization interface $Identikit$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed present-day morphology and kinematics. Our results demonstrate how repeated encounters between two dwarf galaxies can ""park"" baryons at very large distances, without the aid of environmental effects. Our best match to the data is an 8:1 mass ratio encounter where a one-armed spiral is induced in the NGC 4490-analog, which we postulate explains the nature of diffuse starlight presented in the new optical data. We predict that the pair will fully merge in ~370 Myr, but that the extended tidal features will continue to evolve and return to the merged remnant over ~5 Gyr. This pre-processing of baryons will affect the efficiency of gas stripping if such dwarf pairs are accreted by a massive host. In contrast, in isolated environments this study demonstrates how dwarf-dwarf interactions can create a long-lived supply of gas to the merger remnant.","Sarah Pearson, George C.

97,"We present the detection of the first candidate colliding-wind binary (CWB) in M33, located in the giant H II region NGC 604. The source was first identified in archival {\it Chandra} imaging as a relatively soft X-ray point source, with the likely primary star determined from precise astrometric alignment between archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} and {\it Chandra} imaging. The candidate primary star in the CWB is classified for the first time in this work as a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star with a likely O star companion based on spectroscopy obtained from Gemini-North. We model the X-ray spectrum using {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and find the CWB is well-fit as a $\sim$ 1 keV thermal plasma with a median unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.5--2.0 keV band of $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, making this source among the brightest of CWBs observed to date. We present a long term light curve for the candidate CWB from archival {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and discuss the constraints placed on the binary by this light curve, as well as the X-ray luminosity at maximum. Finally, we compare this candidate CWB in M33 to other well-studied, bright CWBs in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, such as $\eta$ Car.","Kristen Garofali, Emily M.

98,"In our HST photometric survey, we have been searching for multiple stellar populations (MPs) in Magellanic Clouds (MCs) massive star clusters which span a significant range of ages ($\sim 1.5-11$ Gyr). In the previous papers of the series, we have shown that the age of the cluster represents one of the key factors in shaping the origin of the chemical anomalies. Here we present the analysis of four additional clusters in the MCs, namely Lindsay 38, Lindsay 113, NGC 2121 and NGC 2155, for which we recently obtained new UV HST observations. These clusters are more massive than $\sim 10^4M_{\odot}$ and have ages between $\sim 2.5-6$ Gyr, i.e. located in a previously unexplored region of the cluster age/mass diagram. We found chemical anomalies, in the form of N spreads, in three out of four clusters in the sample, namely in NGC 2121, NGC 2155 and Lindsay 113. By combining data from our survey and HST photometry for 3 additional clusters in the Milky Way (namely 47 Tuc, M15 and NGC 2419), we show that the extent of the MPs in the form of N spread is a strong function of age, with older clusters having larger N spreads with respect to the younger ones. Hence, we confirm that cluster age plays a significant role in the onset of MPs.","S. Martocchia, E. Dalessandro, C. Lardo, I. Cabrera-Ziri, N. Bastian, V. Kozhurina-Platais, M. Salaris, W.

99,"We investigate the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Specifically, we study the efficiency with which jets can drive sound waves into the ICM. Previous works focused on this issue model the jet-ICM interaction as a spherically symmetric explosion, finding that <~ 12.5% of the blast energy is converted into sound waves, even for instantaneous energy injection. We develop a method for measuring sound wave energy in hydrodynamic simulations and measure the efficiency of sound wave driving by supersonic jets in a model ICM. Our axisymmetric fiducial simulations convert >~ 25% of the jet energy into strong, long-wavelength sound waves which can propagate to large distances. Vigorous instabilities driven by the jet-ICM interaction generate small-scale sound waves which constructively interfere, forming powerful large-scale waves. By scanning a parameter space of opening angles, velocities, and densities, we study how our results depend on jet properties. High velocity, wide angle jets produce sound waves most efficiently, yet the acoustic efficiency never exceeds 1/3 of the jet energy -- an indication that equipartition may limit the nonlinear energy conversion process. Our work argues that sound waves may comprise a significant fraction of the energy budget in cluster AGN feedback and underscores the importance of properly treating compressive wave dissipation in the weakly collisional, magnetized ICM.","Christopher J.

100,"In this paper we undertake a study of the 21 square degree SMOG field, a Spitzer cryogenic mission Legacy program to map a region of the outer Milky Way towards the Perseus and Outer spiral arms with the IRAC and MIPS instruments. We identify 4648 YSOs across the field. Using the DBSCAN method we identify 68 clusters or aggregations of YSOs in the region, having 8 or more members. We identify 1197 class Is, 2632 class IIs, 819 class IIIs, of which 45 are candidate transition disk objects, utilizing the MIPS 24 photometry. The ratio of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 2872/4648, or 62%. The ratios of class I to class II YSOs in the clusters are broadly consistent with those found in the inner galactic and nearby Gould's Belt young star formation regions. The clustering properties indicate that the protostars may be more tightly bound to their natal sites than the class IIs, and the class IIIs are generally widely distributed. We further perform an analysis of the WISE data of the SMOG field to determine how the lower resolution and sensitivity of WISE affects the identification of YSOs as compared to Spitzer: we identify 931 YSOs using combined WISE and 2MASS photometry, 931/4648 or 20% of the total number identified with Spitzer. Performing the same clustering analysis finds 31 clusters which reliably trace the larger associations identified with the Spitzer data. Twelve of the clusters identified have previously measured distances from the WISE HII survey. SEDFitter modeling of these YSOs is reported, leading to an estimation of the IMF in the aggregate of these clusters which approximates that found in the inner galaxy, implying that the processes behind stellar mass distribution during star formation are not widely affected by the lower density and metallicity of the outer galaxy.","Elaine Winston, Joseph Hora, Robert Gutermuth, Volker Tolls","30 pages, 18 figures, 7 tables.

101,"The ultra-diffuse dwarf galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2) has ten (eleven) measured globular clusters (GCs) with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $\sigma=7.8^{+5.2}_{-2.2}\,$km/s ($\sigma=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\,$km/s). Our conventional statistical analysis of the original ten GCs gives $\sigma=8.0^{+4.3}_{-3.0}\,$km/s. The overall distribution of velocities agrees well with a Gaussian of this width. Due to the non-linear Poisson equation in MOND, a dwarf galaxy has weaker self-gravity when in close proximity to a massive host. This external field effect is investigated using a new analytic formulation and fully self-consistent live $N$-body models in MOND. Our formulation agrees well with that of Famaey and McGaugh (2012). These new simulations confirm our analytic results and suggest that DF2 may be in a deep-freeze state unique to MOND. The correctly calculated MOND velocity dispersion agrees with our inferred dispersion and that of van Dokkum et al. (2018b) if DF2 is within 150 kpc of NGC 1052 and both are 20 Mpc away. The GCs of DF2 are however significantly brighter and larger than normal GCs, a problem which disappears if DF2 is significantly closer to us. A distance of 10-13 Mpc makes DF2 a normal dwarf galaxy even more consistent with MOND and the 13 Mpc distance reported by Trujillo et. al. (2019). We discuss the similar dwarf DF4, finding good agreement with MOND. We also discuss possible massive galaxies near DF2 and DF4 along with their distances and peculiar velocities, noting that NGC 1052 may lie at a distance near 10 Mpc.","Hosein Haghi, Pavel Kroupa, Indranil Banik, Xufen Wu, Akram Hasani Zonoozi, Behnam Javanmardi, Amir Ghari, Oliver Müller, Jörg Dabringhausen, Hongsheng Zhao","14 pages, 9 figures, 2 Tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1906.03268v1,No journal ref found,Hongsheng Zhao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03268v1,2019-06-07 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,A new formulation of the external field effect in MOND and numerical   simulations of ultra-diffuse dwarf galaxies $-$ application to NGC 1052-DF2   and NGC 1052-DF4,2019-06-07 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03268v1
102,"All four circumbinary (CB) protoplanetary disks orbiting short-period ($P < 20$ day) double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s)---a group that includes UZ Tau E, for which we present new ALMA data---exhibit sky-plane inclinations $i_{\rm disk}$ which match, to within a few degrees, the sky-plane inclinations $i_\star$ of their stellar hosts. Although for these systems the true mutual inclinations $\theta$ between disk and binary cannot be directly measured because relative nodal angles are unknown, the near-coincidence of $i_{\rm disk}$ and $i_\star$ suggests that $\theta$ is small for these most compact of systems. We confirm this hypothesis using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, showing that 68% of CB disks around short-period SB2s have $\theta < 3.0^\circ$. Near co-planarity of CB disks implies near co-planarity of CB planets discovered by Kepler, which in turn implies that the occurrence rate of close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at longer periods ranging from $30-10^5$ days (where the nodal degeneracy can be broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual inclinations, from co-planar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.","Ian Czekala, Eugene Chiang, Sean M. Andrews, Eric L. N.

We then consider the possibility of analyzing interstellar meteors to learn about their parent planetary systems. We propose a strategy for determining the orbits and chemical compositions of interstellar meteors, using a network of $\sim 600$ all-sky camera systems to track and conduct remote spectroscopy on meteors larger than $\sim 5$cm once every few years.

104,"The morphology of thin stellar streams can be used to test the nature of dark matter. It is therefore crucial to extend searches for globular cluster streams to other galaxies than the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the current and future prospects of detecting globular cluster streams in external galaxies in resolved stars (e.g. with WFIRST) and using integrated light (e.g. with HSC, LSST and Euclid). In particular, we inject mock-streams to data from the PAndAS M31 survey, and produce simulated M31 backgrounds mimicking what WFIRST will observe in M31. Additionally, we estimate the distance limit to which globular cluster streams will be observable. Our results demonstrate that for a 1 hour (1000 sec.) exposure, using conservative estimates, WFIRST should detect globular cluster streams in resolved stars in galaxies out to distances of ~3.5 Mpc (~2 Mpc). This volume contains 199 (122) galaxies of which >90% are dwarfs. With integrated light, thin streams can be resolved out to ~100 Mpc with HSC and LSST and to ~600 Mpc with WFIRST and Euclid. The low surface brightness of the streams (typically >30 mag/arcsec$^2$), however, will make them difficult to detect, unless the streams originate from very young clusters. We emphasize that if the external galaxies do not host spiral arms or galactic bars, gaps in their stellar streams provide an ideal test case for evidence of interactions with dark matter subhalos. Furthermore, obtaining a large samples of thin stellar streams can help constrain the orbital structure and hence the potentials of external halos.","Sarah Pearson, Tjitske K. Starkenburg, Kathryn V.

105,"Exoplanetary systems host giant planets on substantially non-circular, close-in orbits. We propose that these eccentricities arise in a phase of giant impacts, analogous to the final stage of Solar System assembly that formed Earth's Moon. In this scenario, the planets scatter each other and collide, with corresponding mass growth as they merge. We numerically integrate an ensemble of systems with varying total planet mass, allowing for collisional growth, to show that (1) the high-eccentricity giants observed today may have formed preferentially in systems of higher initial total planet mass, and (2) the upper bound on the observed giant planet eccentricity distribution is consistent with planet-planet scattering. We predict that mergers will produce a population of high-mass giant planets between 1 and 5 au from their stars.","Renata Frelikh, Hyerin Jang, Ruth A.

The polarization morphologies observed fall into two distinct categories: azimuthal polarization (DG Tau and Haro 6-13) and polarization parallel to the disk minor axis (RY Tau and MWC 480). The mechanisms responsible for disk polarization at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are currently under debate. In this Letter, we investigate two mechanisms capable of producing polarized dust emission in disks: self-scattering and grain alignment to the radiation anisotropy. The polarization morphologies of DG Tau and Haro 6-13 are broadly consistent with that expected from radiation alignment (though radiative alignment still does not account for all of the features seen in these disks), while RY Tau and MWC 480 are more consistent with self-scattering. Such a variation in the polarized morphology may provide evidence of dust grain size differences between the sources.","Rachel E. Harrison, Leslie W. Looney, Ian W.

The {\epsilon} of the Venus surface was estimated to be ~4.5 at both the 607.67 MHz and 1297.67 MHz, close to the reported values of {\epsilon} of 4 to 4.5 from the radar-based observations including the Magellan observations at 2.38 GHz (12.6 cm).","Nithin Mohan, Suresh Raju C, Govind Swarup, Divya Oberoi","9 pages, 5 figures",1906.03243v1,No journal ref found,Divya Oberoi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03243v1,2019-06-07 17:05:03+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.IM,Polarisation and Brightness Temperature Observations of Venus with the   GMRT,2019-06-07 17:05:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03243v1
108,"We have obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 19 dwarf galaxy candidates in the vicinity of M101. Advanced Camera for Surveys HST photometry for 2 of these objects showed resolved stellar populations and Tip of the Red Giant Branch derived distances consistent with M101 group membership. The other 17 were found to have no resolved stellar populations, meaning they are background low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. It is notable that many LSB objects which had previously been assumed to be M101 group members based on projection have been shown to be background objects, indicating the need for future diffuse dwarf surveys to be careful in drawing conclusions about group membership without robust distance estimates. In this work we update the satellite luminosity function of M101 based on the presence of these new objects down to M_V=-8.2. M101 is a sparsely populated system with only 9 satellites down to M_V~-8, as compared to 26 for M31 and 24.5\pm7.7 for the median local Milky Way (MW)-mass host. This makes M101 the sparsest group probed to this depth, though M94 is even sparser to the depth it has been examined (M_V=-9.1). M101 and M94 share several properties that mark them as unusual compared to the other local MW-mass galaxies examined: they have a sparse satellite population but also have high star forming fractions among these satellites; such properties are also found in the galaxies examined as part of the SAGA survey. We suggest that these properties appear to be tied to the galactic environment, with more isolated galaxies showing sparse satellite populations which are more likely to have had recent star formation, while those in dense environments have more satellites which tend to have no recent star formation. Overall our results show a level of halo-to-halo scatter between galaxies of similar mass that is larger than is predicted in the \LambdaCDM model.","P. Bennet, D. J. Sand, D. Crnojević, K.

109,"We present the results of a long term telescopic observation campaign of comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, parent body of the Draconid meteor shower, spanning $\sim 240$ days during its 2018 apparition. Determinations of comet 21P's dust production rate through the $Af\rho$ parameter derived from these images show that the comet had a highly asymmetric dust production rate that peaked $\sim 10-30$ days before perihelion, when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of $\sim 1.02 - 1.08 \thinspace \mathrm{AU}$. The single highest $Af\rho$ measurement occurred on 2018-Aug-14 (27 days before perihelion), and had a measured value of $Af\rho = 1594 \thinspace \mathrm{cm}$. The comet's $Af\rho$ profile is well described by a double-exponential model that rises rapidly during ingress and declines even more rapidly during its egress. These results are fully consistent with observations of comet 21P's dust and gas production rates during past apparitions, and suggest that the double-exponential model we have derived provides a reasonable and stable approximation for the comet's activity over the past thirty to forty years.","Steven Ehlert, Natalie Moticska, Auriane Egal","12 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

110,"Massive clumps tend to fragment into clusters of cores and condensations, some of which form high-mass stars. In this work, we study the structure of massive clumps at different scales, analyze the fragmentation process, and investigate the possibility that star formation is triggered by nearby HII regions. We present a high angular resolution study of a sample of 8 massive proto-cluster clumps. Combining infrared data, we use few-arcsecond resolution radio- and millimeter interferometric data to study their fragmentation and evolution. Our sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have neighboring HII regions. Taking advantage of that, we test triggered star formation using a novel method where we study the alignment of the centres of mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales. The eight massive clumps have masses ranging from 228 to 2279 $M_\odot$. The brightest compact structures within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact radio continuum sources. The smaller scale structures of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 0.02 pc observed within each clump are mostly gravitationally bound and massive enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star. Many condensations have masses larger than 8 $M_\odot$ at small scale of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 0.02 pc. Although the clumps are mostly infrared quiet, the dynamical movements are active at clump scale ($\sim$ 1 pc). We studied the spatial distribution of the gas conditions detected at different scales. For some sources we find hints of external triggering, whereas for others we find no significant pattern that indicates triggering is dynamically unimportant. This probably indicates that the different clumps go through different evolutionary paths. In this respect, studies with larger samples are highly desired.","Chuan-Peng Zhang, Timea Csengeri, Friedrich Wyrowski, Guang-Xing Li, Thushara Pillai, Karl M. Menten, Jennifer Hatchell, Mark A.

111,"In this letter, we report the discovery of 24 new super Li-rich (A(Li) $\ge$ 3.2) giants of He-core burning phase at red clump region. Results are based on systematic search of a large sample of about 12,500 giants common to the LAMOST spectroscopic and Kepler time resolved photometric surveys. The two key parameters derived from Kepler data; average period spacing ($\Delta p$) between $l=1$ mixed gravity dominated g-modes and average large frequency separation ($\Delta \nu$) $l=0$ acoustic p-modes, suggest all the Li-rich giants are in He-core burning phase. This is the first unbiased survey subjected to a robust technique of asteroseismic analysis to unambiguously determine evolutionary phase of Li-rich giants. The results provide a strong evidence that Li enhancement phenomenon is associated with giants of He-core burning phase, post He-flash, rather than any other phase on RGB with inert He-core surrounded by H-burning shell.","Raghubar Singh, Bacham E.

We look at several black hole candidates, both intragalactic and extragalactic, and suggest Sgr$A^*$ as an optimal candidate for observation of such signatures.

113,"Observations from the Kepler mission have revealed frequent superflares on young and active solar-like stars. Superflares result from the large-scale restructuring of stellar magnetic fields, and are associated with the eruption of coronal material (a coronal mass ejection, or CME) and energy release that can be orders of magnitude greater than those observed in the largest solar flares. These catastrophic events, if frequent, can significantly impact the potential habitability of terrestrial exoplanets through atmospheric erosion or intense radiation exposure at the surface. We present results from numerical modeling designed to understand how an eruptive superflare from a young solar-type star, $\kappa^{1}Cet$, could occur and would impact its astrospheric environment. Our data-inspired, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic modeling shows that global-scale shear concentrated near the radial-field polarity inversion line can energize the closed-field stellar corona sufficiently to power a global, eruptive superflare that releases approximately the same energy as the extreme 1859 Carrington event from the Sun. We examine proxy measures of synthetic emission during the flare and estimate the observational signatures of our CME-driven shock, both of which could have extreme space-weather impacts on the habitability of any Earth-like exoplanets. We also speculate that the observed 1986 Robinson-Bopp superflare from $\kappa^{1}Cet$ was perhaps as extreme for that star as the Carrington flare was for the Sun.","Benjamin J. Lynch, Vladimir S.

115,"We propose a multi-messenger probe of the natural parameter space of QCD axion dark matter based on observations of black hole-neutron star binary inspirals. It is suggested that a dense dark matter spike may grow around intermediate mass black holes ($10^{3}-10^{5} \mathrm{\,M_{\odot}}$). The presence of such a spike produces two unique effects: a distinct phase shift in the gravitational wave strain during the inspiral and a enhancement of the radio emission due to the resonant axion-photon conversion occurring in the neutron star magnetosphere throughout the inspiral and merger. Remarkably, the observation of the gravitational wave signal can be used to infer the dark matter density and, consequently, to predict the radio emission. We study the projected sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling in the light of the LISA interferometer and next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array. Given a sufficiently nearby detection, such observations will explore the QCD axion in the mass range $10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}$.","Thomas D. P.

116,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently been demonstrated on synthetic data to improve upon the precision of cosmological inference. In particular they have the potential to yield more precise cosmological constraints from weak lensing mass maps than the two-point functions. We present the cosmological results with a CNN from the KiDS-450 tomographic weak lensing dataset, constraining the total matter density $\Omega_m$, the fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$, and the intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$. We use a grid of N-body simulations to generate a training set of tomographic weak lensing maps. We test the robustness of the expected constraints to various effects, such as baryonic feedback, simulation accuracy, different value of $H_0$, or the lightcone projection technique. We train a set of ResNet-based CNNs with varying depths to analyze sets of tomographic KiDS mass maps divided into 20 flat regions, with applied Gaussian smoothing of $\sigma=2.34$ arcmin. The uncertainties on shear calibration and $n(z)$ error are marginalized in the likelihood pipeline. Following a blinding scheme, we derive constraints of $S_8 = \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.777^{+0.038}_{-0.036}$ with our CNN analysis, with $A_{\rm{IA}}=1.398^{+0.779}_{-0.724}$. We compare this result to the power spectrum analysis on the same maps and likelihood pipeline and find an improvement of about $30\%$ for the CNN.

117,"The dark energy component of the universe still remains as a mystery, however, several papers based on observational data have shown that its equation of state may have an oscillatory behaviour. In this paper, we provide a general description for the dark-energy equation-of-state $w(z)$ in the form of Fourier series. This description generalises some previous dynamical dark energy models and is in agreement with the $w(z)$ reconstructions. We make use of a modified version of a simple and fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to constraint the model parameters. For the analysis we use data from supernovae type-Ia , baryon acoustic oscillations, $H(z)$ measurements and cosmic microwave background. We provide a comparison of the proposed model with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and the standard Taylor approximation. The Fourier series expansion of $w(z)$ is preferred from $\Lambda$CDM at more than $3\sigma$ significance level based on the improvement in the fit alone. We use the Akaike criteria to perform the model comparison and found that, even though there are extra parameters, there is a slight preference of the Fourier series compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The preferred shape of $w(z)$ found here puts in jeopardy the single scalar field models, as they as they cannot reproduce the crossing the phantom divide line $w=-1$.","David Tamayo, J.

118,"We report the discovery of three stars that, along with the prototype LP40-365, form a distinct class of chemically peculiar runaway stars that are the survivors of thermonuclear explosions. Spectroscopy of the four confirmed LP 40-365 stars finds ONe-dominated atmospheres enriched with remarkably similar amounts of nuclear ashes of partial O- and Si-burning. Kinematic evidence is consistent with ejection from a binary supernova progenitor; at least two stars have rest-frame velocities indicating they are unbound to the Galaxy. With masses and radii ranging between 0.20-0.28 Msun and 0.16-0.60 Rsun, respectively, we speculate these inflated white dwarfs are the partly burnt remnants of either peculiar Type Iax or electron-capture supernovae. Adopting supernova rates from the literature, we estimate that ~20 LP40-365 stars brighter than 19 mag should be detectable within 2 kpc from the Sun at the end of the Gaia mission. We suggest that as they cool, these stars will evolve in their spectroscopic appearance, and eventually become peculiar O-rich white dwarfs. Finally, we stress that the discovery of new LP40-365 stars will be useful to further constrain their evolution, supplying key boundary conditions to the modelling of explosion mechanisms, supernova rates, and nucleosynthetic yields of peculiar thermonuclear explosions.","R.

119,"We suggest that fast-rising blue optical transients (FBOTs) and the brightest event of the class AT2018cow result from an electron-capture collapse to a \NS\ following a merger of a massive ONeMg white dwarf (WD) with another WD. Two distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the less massive WD during the merger and the formation of a shell burning non-degenerate star incorporating the ONeMg core. During the shell burning stage a large fraction of the envelope is lost to the wind, while mass and angular momentum are added to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse occurs with a small envelope mass, after $\sim 10^2-10^4$ years. During the formation of a neutron star as little as $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot $ of the material is ejected at the bounce-off with mildly relativistic velocities and total energy $\sim$ few $ 10^{50}$ ergs. This ejecta becomes optically thin on a time scale of days - this is the FBOT. During the collapse, the neutron star is spun up and magnetic field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically-dominated relativistic wind from the newly formed neutron star shocks against the ejecta, and later against the wind. The radiation-dominated forward shock produces the long-lasting optical afterglow, while the termination shock of the relativistic wind produces the high energy emission in a manner similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae. If the secondary WD was of the DA type, the wind will likely have $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ of hydrogen; this explains the appearance of hydrogen late in the afterglow spectrum. The model explains many of the puzzling properties of FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, a fast and light anisotropic ejecta producing a bright optical peak, afterglow high energy emission of similar luminosity to the optical, and late infra-red features.","Maxim Lyutikov, Silvia Toonen",arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1709.02221,1812.07569v2,No journal ref found,Silvia Toonen,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07569v2,2018-12-18 22:30:12+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,FBOTs and AT2018cow following electron-capture collapse of merged white   dwarfs,2019-06-07 14:40:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07569v2

122,"[ABRIDGED] We derive the dust properties for 753 local galaxies and examine how these relate to some of their physical properties. We model their global dust-SEDs, treated statistically as an ensemble within a hierarchical Bayesian dust-SED modeling approach. The model-derived properties are the dust masses (Mdust), the average interstellar radiation field intensities (Uav), the mass fraction of very small dust grains ('QPAH' fraction), as well as their standard deviations. In addition, we use mid-IR observations to derive SFR and Mstar, quantities independent of the modeling. We derive distribution functions of the properties for the galaxy ensemble and per galaxy type. The mean value of Mdust for the ETGs is lower than that for the LTGs and IRs, despite ETGs and LTGs having Mstar spanning across the whole range observed. The Uav and 'QPAH' fraction show no difference among different galaxy types. When fixing Uav to the Galactic value, the derived 'QPAH' fraction varies across the Galactic value (0.071). The sSFR increases with galaxy type, while this is not the case for the dust-sSFR (=SFR/Mdust), showing an almost constant SFE per galaxy type. The galaxy sample is characterised by a tight relation between Mdust and Mstar for the LTGs and Irs, while ETGs scatter around this relation and tend towards smaller Mdust. While the relation indicates that Mdust may fundamentally be linked to Mstar, metallicity and Uav are the second parameter driving the scatter, which we investigate in a forthcoming work. We use the extended KS law to estimate Mgas and the GDR. The Mgas derived from the extended KS law is on average ~20% higher than that derived from the KS law, and a large standard deviation indicates the importance of the average SF present to regulate star formation and gas supply. The average GDR for the LTGs and IRs is 370, while including the ETGs gives an average of 550.

123,"There are few warp kinematic models of the Galaxy able to characterise structure and kinematics. These models are necessary to study the lopsidedness of the warp and the twisting of the line-of-nodes of the stellar warp, already seen in gas and dust. We use the \Gaia~Data Release 2 astrometric data up to $G=20$mag to characterise the structure of the Galactic warp, the vertical motions and the dependency on the age. We use two populations up to galactocentric distances of $16$kpc, a young (OB-type) and an old (Red Giant Branch, RGB). We use the nGC3 PCM and LonKin methods based on the Gaia observables, together with 2D projections of the positions and proper motions in the Galactic plane. We confirm the age dependency of the Galactic warp, both in positions and kinematics, being the height of the Galactic warp of about $0.2$kpc for the OB sample and of $1.$kpc for the RGB at a galactocentric distance of $14$kpc. Both methods find that the onset radius is $12\sim 13$kpc for the OB sample and $10\sim 11$kpc for the RGB. From the RGB sample, we find from galactocentric distances larger than $10$kpc the line-of-nodes twists away from the Sun-anticentre line towards galactic azimuths $\sim 180-200^{\circ}$ increasing with radius, though possibly influenced by extinction. The RGB sample reveals a slightly lopsided stellar warp with $\sim 250$pc between the up and down sides. The line of maximum of proper motions in latitude is systematically offset from the line-of-nodes estimated from the spatial data, which our models predict as a kinematic signature of lopsidedness. We also show a prominent wave-like pattern of a bending mode different in the OB and RGB, and substructures that might not be related to the Galactic warp nor to a bending mode. GDR2 triggers the need for complex kinematic models, flexible enough to combine both wave-like patterns and an S-shaped lopsided warp.[abridged]","M. Romero-Gómez, C. Mateu, L. Aguilar, F.

124,"Contex. Stellar spectra synthesis is essential for the characterization of potential planetary hosts. In addition, comprehensive stellar variability calculations with fast radiative transfer are needed to disentangle planetary transits from stellar magnetically-driven variability. The planet-hunting space telescopes, such as CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS will bring vast quantities of data, rekindling the interest in fast calculations of the radiative transfer. Aims. We revisit the Opacity Distribution Functions (ODF) approach routinely applied to speedup stellar spectral synthesis. To achieve a considerable speedup relative to the current state-of-the-art, we further optimize the approach and search for the best ODF configuration. Furthermore, we generalize the ODF approach for fast calculations of flux in various filters often used in stellar observations. Methods. In a parameter-sweep-fashion, we generated ODF in the spectral range from UV to IR with different setups. The most accurate ODF configuration for each spectral interval was determined. For calculations of the radiative fluxes through filters we adapted the wavelength grid based on the transmission curve, whereafter the normal ODF procedure was performed. Results. Our optimum ODF configuration allows for a three fold speedup, compared to the previously used ODF configurations. The ODF generalization to calculate fluxes through filters results in a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude.","M. Cernetic, A. I. Shapiro, V. Witzke, N. A. Krivova, S. K. Solanki, R. V.

125,"In various fields of physics and astronomy, access to experimental facilities or to telescopes is becoming more and more competitive and limited. It becomes therefore important to optimize the type of measurements and their scheduling to reach a given scientific objective and to increase the chances of success of a scientific project. In this communication, extending the work of Ford (2008) and of Loredo et al. (2012), we present an efficient adaptive scheduling tool aimed at prioritzing measurements in order to reach a scientific goal. The algorithm, based on the Fisher matrix, can be applied to a wide class of measurements. We present this algorithm in detail and discuss some practicalities such as systematic errors or measurements losses due to contigencies (such as weather, experimental failure, ...). As an illustration, we consider measurements of the short-period star S0-2 in our Galactic Center. We show that the radial velocity measurements at the two turning points of the radial velocity curve are more powerful for detecting the gravitational redshift than measurements at the maximal relativistic signal. We also explicitly present the methodology that was used to plan measurements in order to detect the relativistic redshift considering systematics and possible measurements losses. For the future, we identify the astrometric turning points to be highly sensitive to the relativistic advance of the periastron. Finally, we also identify measurements particularly sensitive to the distance to our Galactic Center: the radial velocities around periastron and the astrometric measurements just before closest approach and at the maximal right ascension astrometric turning point.","A.

126,"The occurrence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the gas phase at low temperature in the dense phases of the ISM suggests that a non-thermal desorption mechanism is at work because otherwise, COMs should condense within a short timescale onto dust grains. Vacuum ultraviolet photodesorption has been shown to be much less efficient for complex organic molecules, such as methanol, because mostly photoproducts are ejected. The induced photolysis competes with photodesorption for large COMs, considerably lowering the efficiency to desorb intact molecules. We investigate the sputtering efficiency of complex organic molecules that are observed either in the ice mantles of interstellar dense clouds directly by infrared spectroscopy (CH3OH), or that are observed in the gas phase by millimeter telescopes (CH3COOCH3) and that could be released from interstellar grain surfaces. We irradiated ice films containing complex organic molecules (methanol and methyl acetate) and water with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the infrared spectra of the film as well as the species released to the gas phase with a mass spectrometer. We demonstrate that when methanol or methyl acetate is embedded in a water-ice mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a large portion is sputtered as an intact molecule, with a sputtering yield close to that of the main water-ice matrix. This must be even more true for more volatile ice matrices, such as those that are embedded in carbon monoxide. Cosmic rays penetrating deep into dense clouds provide an efficient mechanism to desorb complex organic molecules. Compared to VUV photons induced by the interaction of cosmic rays, a large portion desorb as intact molecules with a proportion corresponding to the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter evolving with time as a function of fluence due to the radiolysis of the bulk.","E.

127,"The afterglows to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are due to synchrotron emission from shocks generated as an ultra-relativistic outflow decelerates. A forward and a reverse shock will form, however, where emission from the forward shock is well studied as a potential counterpart to gravitational wave detected neutron star mergers the reverse shock has been neglected. Here, we show how the reverse shock contributes to the afterglow from an off-axis and structured outflow. The off-axis reverse shock will appear as a brightening feature in the rising afterglow at radio frequencies. For bursts at $\sim100$ Mpc, the system should be inclined $\lesssim20^\circ$ for the reverse shock to be observable at $\sim0.1-10$ days post-merger. For structured outflows, enhancement of the reverse shock emission by a strong magnetic field within the outflow is required for the emission to dominate the afterglow at early times. Early radio photometry of the afterglow could reveal the presence of a strong magnetic field associated with the central engine.","Gavin P Lamb, Shiho Kobayashi","8 pages, 5 figures.

128,"Consumer cameras, particularly onboard smartphones and UAVs, are now commonly used as scientific instruments. However, their data processing pipelines are not optimized for quantitative radiometry and their calibration is more complex than that of scientific cameras. The lack of a standardized calibration methodology limits the interoperability between devices and, in the ever-changing market, ultimately the lifespan of projects using them. We present a standardized methodology and database (SPECTACLE) for spectral and radiometric calibrations of consumer cameras, including linearity, bias variations, read-out noise, dark current, ISO speed and gain, flat-field, and RGB spectral response. This includes golden standard ground-truth methods and do-it-yourself methods suitable for non-experts. Applying this methodology to seven popular cameras, we found high linearity in RAW but not JPEG data, inter-pixel gain variations >400% correlated with large-scale bias and read-out noise patterns, non-trivial ISO speed normalization functions, flat-field correction factors varying by up to 2.79 over the field of view, and both similarities and differences in spectral response. Moreover, these results differed wildly between camera models, highlighting the importance of standardization and a centralized database.","Olivier Burggraaff, Norbert Schmidt, Jaime Zamorano, Klaas Pauly, Sergio Pascual, Carlos Tapia, Evangelos Spyrakos, Frans Snik","27 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Optics Express",1906.04155v1,No journal ref found,Frans Snik,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04155v1,2019-06-07 13:03:01+00:00,physics.ins-det,physics.ins-det|astro-ph.IM|eess.IV|physics.optics,Standardized spectral and radiometric calibration of consumer cameras,2019-06-07 13:03:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04155v1
129,"Determinations of the UV luminosity function of AGN at high redshifts are important for constraining the AGN contribution to reionization and understanding the growth of supermassive black holes. Recent inferences of the luminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous selection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a sample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While this sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and completeness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies, intrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function has a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M_*$ of the AGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from $M_*\sim -24$ at z=0.7 to $M_*\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\beta$ significantly steepens from $-1.7$ at $z<2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\simeq 6$. In spite of this steepening, the contribution of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at $z\sim 6$ is subdominant (< 3%), although it can be non-negligible (~10%) if these luminosity functions hold down to $M_{1450}=-18$. Under reasonable assumptions, AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z<0.5), AGN can produce about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the statistics of HI absorption lines in the IGM. Our global analysis of the luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors in the data, particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the AGN selection function in future in order to improve our results. We make various fitting functions, luminosity function analysis codes, and homogenised AGN data publicly available.","Girish Kulkarni, Gábor Worseck, Joseph F.

We analyze 1845 kpc-scale lines of sight across 39 galaxies with molecular line emission measurements from EDGE combined with optical IFU data drawn from CALIFA. We use the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to identify significant factors in predicting star formation rates. We find that the local star formation rate surface density is increased by higher molecular gas surface densities and stellar surface densities. In contrast, we see lower star formation rates in systems with older stellar populations, higher gas- and stellar-phase metallicities and larger galaxy masses. We also find a significant increase in star formation rate with galactocentric radius normalized by the disk scale length, which suggests additional parameters regulating star formation rate not explored in this study.","Biprateep Dey, Erik Rosolowsky, Yixian Cao, Alberto Bolatto, Sebastian F.

131,"Standard analysis pipelines for measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in galaxy surveys make use of a fiducial cosmological model to guide the data compression required to transform from observed redshifts and angles to the measured angular and radial BAO peak positions. In order to remove any dependence on the fiducial cosmology from the results, all models compared to the data should mimic the compression and its dependence on the fiducial model. In practice, approximations are made when testing models: (1) There is assumed to be no residual dependence on the fiducial cosmology after reconstruction, (2) differences in the distance--redshift relationship are assumed to match a linear scaling, and (3) differences in clustering between true and fiducial models are assumed to be removed by the free parameters used to null the non-BAO signal. We test these approximations using the current standard measurement procedure with a set of halo catalogs from the {\sc Aemulus} suite of $N$-body simulations, which span a range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological models. We focus on reconstruction of the primordial BAO and locating the BAO. For the range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmologies covered by the {\sc Aemulus} suite, we find no evidence for systematic errors in the measured BAO shift parameters $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\bot}$ to $< 0.1\%$. However, the measured errors $\sigma_{\alpha_{\parallel}}$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_{\bot}}$ show a notable absolute increase by up to $+0.001$ and $+0.002$ respectively in the case that the fiducial cosmology does not match the truth. These effects on the inferred BAO scale will be important given the precision of measurements expected from future surveys including DESI, Euclid, and WFIRST.","Paul Carter, Florian Beutler, Will J.

134,"Context. Studying the spots of late-type stars is crucial for distinguishing between the various proposed dynamo mechanisms believed to be the main cause of starspot activity. For this research it is important to collect observation time series that are long enough to unravel both long- and short-term spot evolution. Doppler imaging is a very efficient method for studying spots of stars that cannot be angularly resolved. Aims. High-resolution spectral observations during 1994-2017 are analysed in order to reveal long- and short-term changes in the spot activity of the FK Comae-type subgiant HD 199178. Methods. Most of the observations were collected with the Nordic Optical Telescope. The Doppler imaging temperature maps were calculated using an inversion technique based on Tikhonov regularisation and utilising multiple spectral lines. Results. We present a unique series of 41 temperature maps spanning more than 23 years. All reliable images show a large cool spot region centred near the visible rotation pole. Some lower latitude cool features are also recovered, although the reliability of these is questionable. There is an expected anti-correlation between the mean surface temperature and the spot coverage. Using the Doppler images, we construct the equivalent of a solar butterfly diagram for HD 199178. Conclusions. HD 199178 clearly has a long-term large and cool spot structure at the rotational pole. This spot structure dominated the spot activity during the years 1994-2017. The size and position of the structure has evolved with time, with a gradual increase during the last years. The lack of lower latitude features prevents the determination of a possible differential rotation.","Thomas Hackman, Iya Ilyin, Jyri J. Lehtinen, Oleg Kochukhov, Maarit J.

135,"(Abridged) We perform a detailed study of the main optical activity indicators (Ca II H & K, Balmer lines, Na I D$_{\rm 1}$ D$_{\rm 2}$, and He I D$_{\rm 3}$) measured for the Sun using the data provided by the HARPS-N solar-telescope feed at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. The value of the solar rotation period is found in all the activity indicators, with the only exception being H$\delta$. The derived values vary from 26.29 days (H$\gamma$ line) to 31.23 days (He I). From an analysis of sliding periodograms we find that in most of the activity indicators the spectral power is split into several ""bands"" of periods around 26 and 30 days, that might be explained by the migration of active regions between the equator and a latitude of $\sim$ 30$^{\circ}$, spot evolution or a combination of both effects. In agreement with previous works a typical lifetime of active regions of $\sim$ ten rotation periods is inferred from the pooled variance diagrams. We find that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\epsilon$, and He I show a significant correlation with the S index. Significant correlations between the contrast, bisector span, and the heliocentric radial velocity with the activity indexes are also found. We show that the full width at half maximum, the bisector, and the disc-integrated magnetic field correlate with the radial velocity variations. The correlation of the S index and H$\alpha$ changes with time, increasing with larger sun spot numbers and solar irradiance. A similar tendency with the S index - radial velocity correlation is also present in the data. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which higher activity favours the correlation between the S index and the H$\alpha$ activity indicators and between the S index and radial velocity variations.","J.

136,"Polarization data will soon provide the best avenue for measurements of the CMB lensing potential, although it is potentially sensitive to several instrumental effects including beam asymmetry, polarization angle uncertainties, sky coverage, as well as analysis choices such as masking. We derive ""bias-hardened"" lensing estimators to mitigate these effects, at the expense of somewhat larger reconstruction noise, and test them numerically on simulated data. We find that the mean-field bias from masking is significant for the EE quadratic lensing estimator, however the bias-hardened estimator combined with filtering techniques can mitigate the mean field. On the other hand, the EB estimator does not significantly suffer from the mean-field from the point source masking and survey window function. The contamination from beam asymmetry and polarization angle uncertainties, however, can generate mean-field biases for the EB estimator. These can also be mitigated using bias-hardened estimators, with at most a factor of ~ 3 degradation of noise level compared to the conventional approach.","Toshiya Namikawa, Ryuichi Takahashi","12 pages, 5 figures; update explanation about source-hardened

Titan haze s analogs, so-called tholins, were produced on earth to push forward the comprehension of their formation and properties. In this study, this highly complex mixture was analyzed here for the first time by trapped ion mobility spectrometry coupled to ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR MS). Electrospray ionization revealed the characteristic CHNx-class components, with CHN5-6 and DBE 6-7 most abundant.

State-of-the-art IMS is currently not able to resolve the isomeric continuum of ultra-complex mixtures; thus peak parameter other than the CCS-value are explored. As such, analyzing the mobility peak width versus m/z shows a linear increase in isomeric diversity between m/z 170 and 350 and a near plateau in diversity at higher m/z for the N-PAH-like structure. Due to the high complexity of the sample, these structural insights are only to be revealed by TIMS-FTICR MS.","Christopher P. Rueger, Julien Maillard, Johann Le Maitre, Mark Ridgeway, Christopher J.

138,"In this series of papers we develop a formalism for constraining mass profiles in strong gravitational lenses with extended images, using fluxes in addition to positional information. We start in this paper with a circular power-law profile and show that the slope $\gamma$ is uniquely determined by only two observables: the flux ratio $f_1/f_2$ and the image position ratio $\theta_1/\theta_2$ of the two images. We derive an analytic expression relating these two observables to the slope, a result which does not depend on the Einstein angle or the structure or brightness of the source. We then find an expression for the uncertainty on the slope $\sigma_\gamma$ that depends only on the position ratio $\theta_1/\theta_2$ and the total S/N in the images. For example, in a system with position ratio $\theta_1/\theta_2=0.5$, S/N $=100$ and $\gamma=2$ we find that $\gamma$ is constrained to a precision of $\pm0.03$. We then test these results against a series of mock observations. We invert the images and fit an 11 parameter model, including ellipticity and position angle for both lens and source and measure the uncertainty on $\gamma$. We find agreement with the theoretical estimate for all mock observations. In future papers we will examine the radial range of the galaxy over which the constraint on the slope applies, and extend the analysis to elliptical lenses.","Conor M. O'Riordan, Stephen J.

140,"The popular JF12 analytic model by Jansson & Farrar provides a quantitative description of the Galaxy's large-scale magnetic field, which is widely used in various astrophysical applications. However, both the poloidal X-type component and the spiral disk component of JF12 exhibit regions in which the magnetic divergence constraint is violated. We first propose a cure for this problem, resulting in a truly solenoidal large-scale spiral field. Second, the otherwise straight field lines of the X-type component exhibit kinks in the Galactic plane that, in addition to implying the presence of a singular current sheet, may pose difficulties for e.g., numerical tracing of cosmic-ray particles. We propose and discuss two possible strategies to mitigate this problem. Although all corrections are kept as minimal as possible, the extended set of model parameters will have to be carefully readjusted in order to fully restore the agreement to observational data that the unmodified JF12 field is based on. Furthermore, the performance of our improved version of the field model is quantitatively assessed by test simulations using the CRPropa Galactic cosmic-ray propagation code.","Jens Kleimann, Timo Schorlepp, Lukas Merten, Julia Becker Tjus","12 pages, 6 figures",1809.07528v3,No journal ref found,Julia Becker Tjus,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07528v3,2018-09-20 08:35:13+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Solenoidal Improvements for the JF12 Galactic Magnetic Field Model,2019-06-07 09:35:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07528v3
141,"The KiDS Strongly lensed QUAsar Detection project (KiDS-SQuaD) aims at finding as many previously undiscovered gravitational lensed quasars as possible in the Kilo Degree Survey. This is the second paper of this series where we present a new, automatic object classification method based on machine learning technique. The main goal of this paper is to build a catalogue of bright extragalactic objects (galaxies and quasars), from the KiDS Data Release 4, with a minimum stellar contamination, preserving the completeness as much as possible, to then apply morphological methods to select reliable gravitationally lensed (GL) quasar candidates. After testing some of the most used machine learning algorithms, decision trees based classifiers, we decided to use CatBoost, that was specifically trained with the aim of creating a sample of extragalactic sources as clean as possible from stars. We discuss the input data, define the training sample for the classifier, give quantitative estimates of its performances, and finally describe the validation results with Gaia DR2, AllWISE, and GAMA catalogues. We have built and make available to the scientific community the KiDS Bright EXtraGalactic Objects catalogue (KiDS-BEXGO), specifically created to find gravitational lenses. This is made of $\approx6$ millions of sources classified as quasars ($\approx 200\,000$) and galaxies ($\approx 5.7$M), up to $r<22^m$. From this catalog we selected 'Multiplets': close pairs of quasars or galaxies surrounded by at least one quasar, presenting the 12 most reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates, to demonstrate the potential of the catalogue, which will be further explored in a forthcoming paper. We compared our search to the previous one, presented in the first paper from this series, showing that employing a machine learning method decreases the stars-contaminators within the GL candidates.","Vladislav Khramtsov, Alexey Sergeyev, Chiara Spiniello, Crescenzo Tortora, Nicola R.

142,"High contrast imaging enables the determination of orbital parameters for substellar companions (planets, brown dwarfs) from the observed relative astrometry and the estimation of model and age-dependent masses from their observed magnitudes or spectra. Combining astrometric positions with radial velocity gives direct constraints on the orbit and on the dynamical masses of companions. A brown dwarf was discovered with the VLT/SPHERE instrument in 2017, which orbits at $\sim$ 11 au around HD 206893. Its mass was estimated between 12 and 50 $M_{Jup}$ from evolutionary models and its photometry. However, given the significant uncertainty on the age of the system and the peculiar spectrophotometric properties of the companion, this mass is not well constrained. We aim at constraining the orbit and dynamical mass of HD 206893 B. We combined radial velocity data obtained with HARPS spectra and astrometric data obtained with the high contrast imaging VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo instruments, with a time baseline less than three years. We then combined those data with astrometry data obtained by Hipparcos and Gaia with a time baseline of 24 years. We used a MCMC approach to estimate the orbital parameters and dynamical mass of the brown dwarf from those data. We infer a period between 21 and 33{\deg} and an inclination in the range 20-41{\deg} from pole-on from HD 206893 B relative astrometry. The RV data show a significant RV drift over 1.6 yrs. We show that HD 206893 B cannot be the source of this observed RV drift as it would lead to a dynamical mass inconsistent with its photometry and spectra and with Hipparcos and Gaia data. An additional inner (semimajor axis in the range 1.4-2.6 au) and massive ($\sim$ 15 $M_{Jup}$) companion is needed to explain the RV drift, which is compatible with the available astrometric data of the star, as well as with the VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo nondetection.","A.

The flux and slope of their X-ray continuum, together with Fermi/LAT data allows us to estimate their total electromagnetic output and peak frequency. For some of them we can study the source in different states, and investigate the main cause of the observed different spectral energy distribution. We then collected all blazars at redshift greater than 2 observed by NuSTAR, and confirm that these hard and luminous X-ray blazars are among the most powerful persistent sources in the Universe. We confirm the relation between the jet power and the disk luminosity, extending it at the high energy end.","G. Ghisellini, M. L. Perri, G. Costamante, G. Tagliaferri, T. Sbarrato, S.

146,"We present timing and spectral analysis of data from an observation of the High Mass X-ray Binary pulsar 4U 1907+09 with the LAXPC instrument onboard AstroSat. The light curve consisted of a flare at the beginning of the observation, followed by persistent emission. The pulsar continues to spin down, and the pulse profile is found to be double-peaked up to 16 keV with the peaks separated by a phase of $\sim0.45$. Significant energy dependence of the pulse profile is seen with diminishing amplitude of the secondary peak above 16 keV, and increasing amplitude of the main peak upto 40 keV and a sharp decline after that. We confirm earlier detections of the Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF) in 4U 1907+09 at $\sim 18.5\pm 0.2$ keV in the phase-averaged spectrum with a high detection significance. An intensity resolved spectral analysis of the initial flare in the light curve shows that the CRSF parameters do not change with a change in luminosity by a factor of 2.6. We also performed pulse phase-resolved spectral analysis with ten independent phase bins. The energy and the strength of the cyclotron line show pulse phase dependence that is in agreement with previous measurements. Two features from the current observation: different energy dependence of the two pulse peaks and a strong CRSF only around the secondary peak, both indicate a deviation from a dipole geometry of the magnetic field of the neutron star, or complex beaming pattern from the two poles.","Varun Bahal, Pragati Pradhan, Chandreyee Maitra, Harsha Raichur, Biswajit Paul","10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in APJ",1906.02917v1,No journal ref found,Biswajit Paul,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02917v1,2019-06-07 06:23:07+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Pulse Phase Variation of Cyclotron Line in HMXB 4U 1907+09 with ASTROSAT   LAXPC,2019-06-07 06:23:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02917v1
147,"We study and compare different examples of stellar evolutionary synthesis input parameters used to produce photoionisation model grids using the MAPPINGS V modelling code. The aim of this study is to (a) explore the systematic effects of various stellar evolutionary synthesis model parameters on the interpretation of emission lines in optical strong-line diagnostic diagrams, (b) characterise the combination of parameters able to reproduce the spread of local galaxies located in the star-forming region in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and (c) investigate the emission from extremely metal-poor galaxies using photoionisation models. We explore and compare the stellar input ionising spectrum (stellar population synthesis code [Starburst99, SLUG, BPASS], stellar evolutionary tracks, stellar atmospheres, star-formation history, sampling of the initial mass function) as well as parameters intrinsic to the H II region (metallicity, ionisation parameter, pressure, H II region boundedness). We also perform a comparison of the photoionisation codes MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. On the variations in the ionising spectrum model parameters, we find that the differences in strong emission-line ratios between varying models for a given input model parameter are small, on average ~0.1 dex. An average difference of ~0.1 dex in emission-line ratio is also found between models produced with MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. Large differences between the emission-line ratios are found when comparing intrinsic H II region parameters. We find that low-metallicity galaxies are better explained by a density-bounded H II region and higher pressures better encompass the spread of galaxies at high redshift.","Joshua J.

148,"In this paper we report on the characterization of the Hamamatsu VUV4 (S/N: S13370-6152) Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) sensitive Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) as part of the development of a solution for the detection of liquid xenon scintillation light for the nEXO experiment. Various SiPM features, such as: dark noise, gain, correlated avalanches, direct crosstalk and Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) were measured in a dedicated setup at TRIUMF. SiPMs were characterized in the range $163 \text{ } \text{K} \leq \text{T}\leq 233 \text{ } \text{K}$. At an over voltage of $3.1\pm0.2$ V and at $\text{T}=163 \text{ }\text{K}$ we report a number of Correlated Avalanches (CAs) per pulse in the $1 \upmu\text{s}$ interval following the trigger pulse of $0.161\pm0.005$. At the same settings the Dark-Noise (DN) rate is $0.137\pm0.002 \text{ Hz/mm}^{2}$. Both the number of CAs and the DN rate are within nEXO specifications. The PDE of the Hamamatsu VUV4 was measured for two different devices at $\text{T}=233 \text{ }\text{K}$ for a mean wavelength of $189\pm7\text{ nm}$. At $3.6\pm0.2$ V and $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over voltage we report a PDE of $13.4\pm2.6\text{ }\%$ and $11\pm2\%$, corresponding to a saturation PDE of $14.8\pm2.8\text{ }\%$ and $12.2\pm2.3\%$, respectively. Both values are well below the $24\text{ }\%$ saturation PDE advertised by Hamamatsu. More generally, the second device tested at $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over voltage is below the nEXO PDE requirement. The first one instead yields a PDE that is marginally close to meeting the nEXO specifications. This suggests that with modest improvements the Hamamatsu VUV4 MPPCs could be considered as an alternative to the FBK-LF SiPMs for the final design of the nEXO detector.","G. Gallina, P. Giampa, F.

149,"The spectral hardenings of cosmic ray nuclei above $\sim 200$ GV followed by softenings around 10 TV, the knee of the all-particle spectrum around PeV energies, as well as the pattern change of the amplitude and phase of the large-scale anisotropies around 100 TeV indicate the complexities of the origin and transportation of Galactic cosmic rays. It has been shown that nearby source(s) are most likely to be the cause of such spectral features of both the spectra and the anisotropies. In this work, we study the anisotropy features of different mass composition (or mass groups) of cosmic rays in this nearby source model. We show that even if the spectral features from the nearby source component is less distinctive compared with the background component from e.g., the population of distant sources, the anisotropy features are more remarkable to be identified. Measurements of the anisotropies of each mass composition (group) of cosmic rays by the space experiments such as DAMPE and HERD and the ground-based experiments such as LHAASO in the near future are expected to be able to critically test this scenario.","Bing-Qiang Qiao, Wei Liu, Yi-Qing Guo, Qiang Yuan","9 pages, 5 figures",1905.12505v2,No journal ref found,Qiang Yuan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12505v2,2019-05-29 14:48:43+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Anisotropies of different mass compositions of cosmic rays,2019-06-07 04:23:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12505v2
150,"Studying high-mass white dwarfs (WDs) can shed light on the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. Recently, the unprecedented power of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) has revealed an enhancement of high-mass WDs on the H-R diagram, called the Q branch. This branch is located at the high-mass end of the crystallization branch identified by Tremblay et al. (2019). However, investigating its properties, we find that the number density and the velocity distribution of WDs on the Q branch cannot be explained by the cooling delay of crystallization alone, suggesting the existence of an extra cooling delay. To explore the properties of this delay, we statistically compare two age indicators -- the dynamical age reflected by transverse velocity and the photometric age -- for more than one thousand high-mass WDs (1.08-1.23 $\rm M_\odot$). We show that, in addition to crystallization and merger delays, an $8$-Gyr cooling delay is required on the Q branch, which affects about $7\%$ of high-mass WDs. This is a challenge to WD cooling models. $\rm ^{22}Ne$ settling in some WDs might account for this extra delay. We also show that $20\pm6\%$ of high-mass WDs originate from double-WD mergers, corresponding to a merger rate of $\rm (2.1\pm0.6)\times10^{-14}\,M_\odot^{-1}\,yr^{-1}$ in their mass range. This is a direct observational constraint on the rate of double-WD mergers, which is a promising channel of Type Ia supernova explosion.","Sihao Cheng, Jeffrey D.

151,"Many short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) exhibit a prolonged plateau in the X-ray light curve following the main burst. It is shown that an X-ray plateau at the observed luminosity emerges naturally from a plerion-like model of the sGRB remnant, in which the magnetized, relativistic wind of a millisecond magnetar injects shock-accelerated electrons into a cavity confined by the sGRB blast wave. A geometry-dependent fraction of the plerionic radiation is also intercepted and reprocessed by the optically thick merger ejecta. The relative contributions of the plerion and ejecta to the composite X-ray light curve are estimated approximately with the aid of established ejecta models. The plerionic component of the electron energy spectrum is evolved under the action of time-dependent, power-law injection and adiabatic and synchrotron cooling in order to calculate the X-ray light curve analytically. The model yields an anti-correlation between the luminosity and duration of the plateau as well as a sudden cut-off in the X-ray flux, if the decelerating magnetar collapses to form a black hole. Both features are broadly consistent with the data and can be related to the surface magnetic field of the magnetar and its angular velocity at birth. The analogy with core-collapse supernova remnants is discussed briefly.","L C Strang, A Melatos",No comment found,1906.02877v1,No journal ref found,A Melatos,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02877v1,2019-06-07 03:10:38+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Plerion model of the X-ray plateau in short gamma-ray bursts,2019-06-07 03:10:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02877v1
152,"Low redshift surveys of galaxy peculiar velocities provide a wealth of cosmological information. We revisit the idea of extracting this information by directly measuring the redshift-space momentum power spectrum from such surveys. We provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical framework for estimating and fitting this from data, analogous to well understood techniques used to measure the galaxy density power spectrum from redshift surveys. We formally derive a new estimator, which includes the effects of shot noise and survey geometry; we evaluate the variance of the estimator in the Gaussian regime; we compute the optimal weights for the estimator; we demonstrate that the measurements are Gaussian distributed, allowing for easy extraction of cosmological parameters; and we explore the effects of peculiar velocity measurement errors. We finish with a proof-of-concept using realistic mock galaxy catalogues, which demonstrates that we can measure and fit both the redshift-space galaxy density and momentum power spectra from peculiar velocity surveys and that including the latter substantially improves our constraints on the growth rate of structure. We also provide theoretical descriptions for modelling the non-linear redshift-space density and momentum power spectrum multipoles, and forecasting the constraints on cosmological parameters using the Fisher information contained in these measurements for arbitrary weights.

153,"Measurements of the growth rate of structure, $f\sigma_8$ in the low-redshift Universe allow stringent tests of the cosmological model. In this work, we provide new constraints on $f\sigma_{8}$ at an effective redshift of $z=0.03$ using the combined density and velocity fields measured by the 2MTF and 6dFGSv surveys. We do this by applying a new estimator of the redshift-space density and momentum (density-weighted velocity) power spectra, developed in the first paper of this series, to measured redshifts and peculiar velocities from these datasets. We combine this with models of the density and momentum power spectra in the presence of complex survey geometries and with an ensemble of simulated galaxy catalogues that match the survey selection functions and galaxy bias. We use these simulations to estimate the errors on our measurements and identify possible systematics. In particular, we are able to identify and remove biases caused by the non-Gaussianity of the power spectra by applying the Box-Cox transformation to the power spectra prior to fitting. After thorough validation of our methods we recover a constraint of $f\sigma_8(z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.03)=0.404^{+0.082}_{-0.081}$ from the combined 2MTF and 6dFGSv data. This measurement is fully consistent with the expectations of General Relativity and the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model.

154,"We report on the global structure of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo up to its outer boundary based on the analysis of blue-horizontal branch stars (BHBs). These halo tracers are extracted from the $(g,r,i,z)$ band multi-photometry in the internal data release of the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) surveyed over $\sim550$~deg$^2$ area. In order to select most likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars (BSs) and other contamination in a statistically significant manner, we have developed and applied an extensive Bayesian method, instead of the simple color cuts adopted in our previous work, where each of the template BHBs and non-BHBs obtained from the available catalogs is represented as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions in the color-color diagrams. We found from the candidate BHBs in the range of 18.5<g<23.5 mag that the radial density distribution over a Galactocentric radius of r=36-360 kpc can be approximated as a single power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=3.74^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ or a broken power-law profile with an index of $\alpha_{\rm in}=2.92^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $r$ below a broken radius of $r_{\rm b}=160^{+18}_{-19}$~kpc and a very steep slope of $\alpha_{\rm out}=15.0^{+3.7}_{-4.5}$ at $r>r_{\rm b}$. The latter profile with a prolate shape having an axial ratio of $q=1.72^{+0.44}_{-0.28}$ is most likely and this halo may hold a rather sharp boundary at r=160kpc. The slopes of the halo density profiles are compared with those from the suite of hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of stellar halos. This comparison suggests that the MW stellar halo may consist of the two overlapping components: the in situ. inner halo as probed by RR Lyrae stars showing a relatively steep radial density profile and the ex situ. outer halo with a shallow profile probed by BHBs here, which is made by accretion of small stellar systems.","Tetsuya Fukushima, Masashi Chiba, Mikito Tanaka, Kohei Hayashi, Daisuke Homma, Sakurako Okamoto, Yutaka Komiyama, Masayuki Tanaka, Nobuo Arimoto, Tadafumi Matsuno","15 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, version to be published in PASJ",1904.04966v2,No journal ref found,Tadafumi Matsuno,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04966v2,2019-04-10 01:26:45+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.SR,The stellar halo of the Milky Way traced by blue horizontal-branch stars   in the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey,2019-06-07 02:54:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04966v2

Here, we present KAGRA's possible upgrade plans to improve the sensitivity in the decade ahead. Unlike other state-of-the-art detectors, KAGRA requires different investigations for the upgrade since it is the only detector which employs cryogenic cooling of the test mass mirrors. In this paper, investigations on the upgrade plans which can be realized by changing the input laser power, increasing the mirror mass, and injecting frequency dependent squeezed vacuum are presented. We show how each upgrade affects to the detector frequency bands and also discuss impacts on gravitational-wave science.

156,"This paper demonstrates a novel and efficient unsupervised clustering method with the combination of a Self-Organising Map (SOM) and a convolutional autoencoder. The rapidly increasing volume of radio-astronomical data has increased demand for machine learning methods as solutions to classification and outlier detection. Major astronomical discoveries are unplanned and found in the unexpected, making unsupervised machine learning highly desirable by operating without assumptions and labelled training data. Our approach shows SOM training time is drastically reduced and high-level features can be clustered by training on auto-encoded feature vectors instead of raw images. Our results demonstrate this method is capable of accurately separating outliers on a SOM with neighbourhood similarity and K-means clustering of radio-astronomical features complexity. We present this method as a powerful new approach to data exploration by providing a detailed understanding of the morphology and relationships of Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset image features which can be applied to new radio survey data.","Nicholas O.

We confirm the planet's existence with a direct detection of CO in the planet's atmosphere. We also calculate a mass of 11.6 M$_J$ based on the amplitude of its radial velocity variations. We estimate its flux contrast with its host star to get an absolute magnitude estimate for the planet of 8.17 in the K band. This magnitude implies the planet formed via a ""hot start"" formation mechanism.

158,"Searches for continuous gravitational waves from rapidly spinning neutron stars normally assume that the star rotates about one of its principal axes of moment of inertia, and hence the gravitational radiation emits only at twice the spin frequency of the star, $2f_*$. The superfluid interior of a star pinned to the crust along an axis nonaligned with any of its principal axes allows the star to emit gravitational waves at both $f_*$ and $2f_*$, even without free precession, a phenomenon not clearly observed in known pulsars. The dual-harmonic emission mechanism motivates searches combining the two frequency components of a signal to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We describe an economical, semicoherent, dual-harmonic search method, combined with a maximum likelihood coherent matched filter, F-statistic, and improved from an existing hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking scheme to track two frequency components simultaneously. We validate the method and demonstrate its performance through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that for sources emitting gravitational waves at both $f_*$ and $2f_*$, the rate of correctly recovering synthetic signals (i.e., detection efficiency), at a given false alarm probability, can be improved by $\sim 10$%-70% by tracking two frequencies simultaneously compared to tracking a single component only. For sources emitting at $2f_*$ only, dual-harmonic tracking only leads to minor sensitivity loss, producing $\lesssim 10\%$ lower detection efficiency than tracking a single component. In directed continuous-wave searches where $f_*$ is unknown and hence the full frequency band is searched, the computationally efficient HMM tracking algorithm provides an option of conducting both the dual-harmonic search and the conventional single frequency tracking to obtain optimal sensitivity, with a typical run time of $\sim 10^3$ core-hr for one year's observation.","Ling Sun, Andrew Melatos, Paul D.

159,"We investigate the scattering of strahl electrons by micro-instabilities as a mechanism for creating the electron halo in the solar wind. We develop a mathematical framework for the description of electron-driven micro-instabilities and discuss the associated physical mechanisms. We find that an instability of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) mode is the best candidate for a micro-instability that scatters strahl electrons into the halo. We derive approximate analytical expressions for its instability threshold and confirm their accuracy through comparison with numerical solutions to the hot-plasma dispersion relation. We find that the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability creates copious FM/W waves under low-$\beta_{\mathrm c}$ conditions when $U_{0\mathrm s}\gtrsim 3w_{\mathrm c}$, where $\beta_{\mathrm c}$ is the ratio of the core electrons' thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure, $U_{0\mathrm s}$ is the strahl speed, and $w_{\mathrm c}$ is the thermal speed of the core. These waves have a propagation angle of about $60^{\circ}$ with respect to the background magnetic field and a frequency of about half the local electron gyro-frequency. We also derive an analytical expression for the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability for $\beta_{\mathrm c}$ values approaching unity. The comparison of our theory results with data from the \emph{Wind} spacecraft confirms the relevance of the oblique FM/W instability for the solar wind. We show that the whistler heat-flux, ion-acoustic heat-flux, kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave heat-flux, and electrostatic electron-beam instabilities cannot fulfill the requirements for self-induced scattering of strahl electrons into the halo. We make predictions for the electron strahl close to the Sun, which will be testable against measurements from \emph{Parker Solar Probe} and \emph{Solar Orbiter}.","Daniel Verscharen, Benjamin D. G.

160,"We develop a primordial black hole (PBH) production mechanism, deriving non-Gaussian tails from interacting quantum fields during early universe inflation. The multi-field potential landscape may contain relatively flat directions, as a result of energetically favorable adjustments of fields coupled to the inflaton. Such additional fields do not contribute to CMB fluctuations given a sufficient large-scale decay, related to a gap in the critical exponents computed using stochastic methods. Along such directions transverse to the inflaton, the field makes rare jumps to large values. Mixing with the inflaton leads to a substantial tail in the resulting probability distribution for the primordial perturbations. Incorporating a large number of flavors of fields ensures theoretical control of radiative corrections and a substantial abundance. This generates significant PBH production for a reasonable window of parameters, with the mass range determined by the time period of mixing and the inflationary Hubble scale. We analyze a particular model in detail, and then comment on a broader family of models in this class which suggests a mechanism for primordial seeds for early super-massive black holes in the universe. Along the way, we encounter an analytically tractable example of stochastic dynamics and provide some representative calculations of its correlations and probability distributions.","George Panagopoulos, Eva Silverstein",30 pages,1906.02827v1,No journal ref found,Eva Silverstein,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02827v1,2019-06-06 21:50:45+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO,Primordial Black Holes from non-Gaussian tails,2019-06-06 21:50:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02827v1
161,"Over the past few decades impressive progress has been made in the field of photon polarimetry, especially in the hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray energy regime. Measurements of the linear degree of polarization for some of the most energetic astrophysical sources, such as Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) or Blazars, is now possible, at energies below the pair creation threshold. As such, a new window has been opened into understanding exact nature of the non-thermal emission mechanisms responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. There are still many open questions, and active debates, such as the discrimination between leptonic vs. hadronic models of emission for Blazars or ordered vs random field models for GRBs. Since the competing models predict different levels of linear photon polarization at energies above 1 MeV, gamma-ray polarimetry in that energy band could provide additional crucial insights. However, no polarimeter for gamma-rays with energies above 1MeV has been flown into space, as the sensitivity is severely limited by a quick degradation of the angular resolution and by multiple Coulomb scatterings in the detector.

With continuous 0.5--7.8~$\mu$m coverage from both FGS (0.50--0.55, 0.8--1.0, and 1.0--1.2~$\mu$m photometry; 1.25--1.95~$\mu$m spectroscopy) and AIRS (1.95--7.80~$\mu$m spectroscopy), ARIEL will determine atmospheric compositions and probe planetary formation histories during its 3.5-year mission. NASA's proposed Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets (CASE) would be a subsystem of ARIEL's FGS instrument consisting of two visible-to-infrared detectors, associated readout electronics, and thermal control hardware. FGS, to be built by the Polish Academy of Sciences' Space Research Centre, will provide both fine guiding and visible to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, providing powerful diagnostics of atmospheric aerosol contribution and planetary albedo, which play a crucial role in establishing planetary energy balance. The CASE team presents here an independent study of the capabilities of ARIEL to measure exoplanetary metallicities, which probe the conditions of planet formation, and FGS to measure scattering spectral slopes, which indicate if an exoplanet has atmospheric aerosols (clouds and hazes), and geometric albedos, which help establish planetary climate. Our design reference mission simulations show that ARIEL could measure the mass-metallicity relationship of its 1000-planet single-visit sample to $>7.5\sigma$ and that FGS could distinguish between clear, cloudy, and hazy skies and constrain an exoplanet's atmospheric aerosol composition to $>5\sigma$ for hundreds of targets, providing statistically-transformative science for exoplanet atmospheres.","Robert T.

163,"Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are flashes of gamma-rays thought to originate from rare forms of massive star collapse (long GRBs), or from mergers of compact binaries (short GRBs) containing at least one neutron star (NS). The nature of the post-explosion / post-merger remnant (NS versus black hole, BH) remains highly debated. In ~50% of both long and short GRBs, the temporal evolution of the X-ray afterglow that follows the flash of gamma-rays is observed to ""plateau"" on timescales of 100-10000 s since explosion, possibly signaling the presence of energy injection from a long-lived, highly magnetized NS (magnetar). The Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA) proposed by [R. Coyne et. al., (2016)] aims to optimize searches for intermediate-duration (100-10000s) gravitational waves (GWs) from GRB remnants. In this work, we test CoCoA on real data collected with ground-based GW detectors. We further develop the detection statistics on which CoCoA is based to allow for multi-waveform searches spanning a physically-motivated parameter space, so as to account for uncertainties in the physical properties of GRB remnants.","Eric Sowell, Alessandra Corsi, Robert Coyne","20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, submitted to Phys.

Here we analyze NICER and XMM-Newton observations of RX J1605.3+3249, in order to address its timing and spectral behavior. Contrary to a previous tentative detection, but in agreement with the recent work by Pires et al. (2019), we find no significant pulsation with pulsed fraction higher than 1.3% (3{\sigma}) for periods above 150 ms. We also find a limit of 2.6% for periods above 2 ms, despite searches in different energy bands. The X-ray spectrum can be fit by either a double-blackbody model or by a single-temperature magnetized atmosphere model, both modified by a Gaussian absorption line at ~0.44 keV. The origin of the absorption feature as a proton cyclotron line or as an atomic transition in the neutron star atmosphere is discussed.

165,"Recent works have discovered two fast ($\approx 10$ ks) extragalactic X-ray transients in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S XT1 and XT2). These findings suggest that a large population of similar extragalactic transients might exist in archival X-ray observations. We develop a method that can effectively detect such transients in a single Chandra exposure, and systematically apply it to Chandra surveys of CDF-S, CDF-N, DEEP2, UDS, COSMOS, and E-CDF-S, totaling 19~Ms of exposure. We find 13 transient candidates, including CDF-S XT1 and XT2. With the aid of available excellent multiwavelength observations, we identify the physical nature of all these candidates. Aside from CDF-S XT1 and XT2, the other 11 sources are all stellar objects, and all of them have $z$-band magnitudes brighter than 20.

166,"A recent study using $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ observations found periodic, high-speed, collimated ejections (or ""bullets"") from the star V Hya. The authors of that study proposed a model associating these bullets with the periastron passage of an unseen, substellar companion in an eccentric orbit and with an orbital period of $\sim8$ yrs. Here we propose that V Hya is part of a triple system, with a substellar companion having an orbital period of $\sim8$ yrs, and a tertiary object on a much wider orbit. In this model, the more distant object causes high-eccentricity excitations on the substellar companion's orbit via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. These eccentricities can reach such high values that they lead to Roche-lobe crossing, producing the observed bullet ejections via a strongly enhanced accretion episode. For example, we find that a ballistic bullet ejection mechanism can be produced by a brown-dwarf-mass companion, while magnetically driven outflows are consistent with a Jovian-mass companion. Finally, we suggest that the distant companion may reside at few a hundred AU on an eccentric orbit.","Jesus M. Salas, Smadar Naoz, Mark R. Morris, Alexander P.

167,"Wide low-mass substellar companions are known to be very rare among low-mass stars, but appear to become increasingly common with increasing stellar mass. However, B-type stars, which are the most massive stars within ~150 pc of the Sun, have not yet been examined to the same extent as AFGKM-type stars in that regard. In order to address this issue, we launched the ongoing B-star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST) to examine the frequency and properties of planets, brown dwarfs, and disks around B-type stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) association; we also analyzed archival data of B-type stars in Sco-Cen. During this process, we identified a candidate substellar companion to the B9-type spectroscopic binary HIP 79098 AB, which we refer to as HIP 79098 (AB)b. The candidate had been previously reported in the literature, but was classified as a background contaminant on the basis of its peculiar colors. Here we demonstrate that the colors of HIP 79098 (AB)b are consistent with several recently discovered young and low-mass brown dwarfs, including other companions to stars in Sco-Cen. Furthermore, we show unambiguous common proper motion over a 15-year baseline, robustly identifying HIP 79098 (AB)b as a bona fide substellar circumbinary companion at a 345+/-6 AU projected separation to the B9-type stellar pair. With a model-dependent mass of 16-25 Mjup yielding a mass ratio of <1%, HIP 79098 (AB)b joins a growing number of substellar companions with planet-like mass ratios around massive stars. Our observations underline the importance of common proper motion analysis in the identification of physical companionship, and imply that additional companions could potentially remain hidden in the archives of purely photometric surveys.","Markus Janson, Ruben Asensio-Torres, Damien Andre, Mickael Bonnefoy, Philippe Delorme, Sabine Reffert, Silvano Desidera, Maud Langlois, Gael Chauvin, Raffaele Gratton, Alexander J.

168,"The role of radiation pressure in shaping exoplanet photoevaporation remains a topic of contention. Radiation pressure from the exoplanet's host star has been proposed as a mechanism to drive the escaping atmosphere into a ""cometary"" tail and explain the high velocities observed in systems where mass loss is occurring. In this paper we present results from high-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of a planet similar to HD 209458b. We self-consistently launch a wind flowing outward from the planet by calculating the ionization and heating resulting from incident high-energy radiation, and account for radiation pressure. We first present a simplified calculation, setting a limit on the Lyman-alpha flux required to drive the photo-evaporated planetary material to larger radii and line-of-sight velocities. We then present the results of our simulations, which confirm the limits determined by our analytic calculation. We thus demonstrate that for the Lyman-alpha fluxes expected for HD 209458, radiation pressure cannot significantly affect photoevaporative winds and cannot explain the high velocities at which wind material is observed.","Alex Debrecht, Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback, Adam Frank, Eric G.

169,"Substantial evidence in the last few decades suggests that outflows from supermassive black holes (SMBH) may play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies. Large-scale outflows known as warm absorbers (WA) and fast disk winds known as ultra-fast outflows (UFO) are commonly found in the spectra of many Seyfert galaxies and quasars and a correlation has been suggested between them. Recent detections of low ionization and low column density outflows, but with a high velocity comparable to UFOs, challenge such initial possible correlations. Observations of UFOs in AGN indicate that their energetics may be enough to impact the interstellar medium (ISM). However, observational evidence of the interaction between the inner high-ionization outflow and the ISM is still missing. We present here the spectral analysis of 12 XMM-Newton/EPIC archival observations of the quasar PG 1114+445, aimed at studying the complex outflowing nature of its absorbers. Our analysis revealed the presence of three absorbing structures. We find a WA with velocity $v\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$, ionization $\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim0.35$ and column density $\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim22$, and a UFO with $v_\text{out}\sim0.145c$, $\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim4$, and $\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim23$. We also find an additional absorber in the soft X-rays ($E<2$ keV) with velocity comparable to the one of the UFO ($v_\text{out}\sim0.120c$), but ionization ($\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim0.5$) and column density ($\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim21.5$) comparable with the ones of the WA. The ionization, velocity and variability of the three absorbers indicate an origin in a multiphase and multiscale outflow, consistently with entrainment of the clumpy ISM by an inner UFO moving at $\sim15\%$ the speed of light, producing an entrained ultra-fast outflow (E-UFO).","Roberto Serafinelli, Francesco Tombesi, Fausto Vagnetti, Enrico Piconcelli, Massimo Gaspari, Francesco G.

170,"Orbiting the Sun at an average distance of 0.59 au and with the shortest aphelion of any known minor body, at 0.77 au, the Atira-class asteroid 2019 AQ3 may be an orbital outlier or perhaps an early indication of the presence of a new population of objects: those following orbits entirely encompassed within that of Venus, the so-called Vatiras. Here, we explore the orbital evolution of 2019 AQ3 within the context of the known Atiras to show that, like many of them, it displays a present-day conspicuous coupled oscillation of the values of eccentricity and inclination, but no libration of the value of the argument of perihelion with respect to the invariable plane of the Solar system. The observed dynamics is consistent with being the result of the combined action of two dominant perturbers, the Earth-Moon system and Jupiter, and a secondary one, Venus. Such a multiperturber-induced secular dynamics translates into a chaotic evolution that can eventually lead to a resonant behaviour of the Lidov-Kozai type. Asteroid 2019 AQ3 may have experienced brief stints as a Vatira in the relatively recent past and it may become a true Vatira in the future, outlining possible dynamical pathways that may transform Atiras into Vatiras and vice versa. Our results strongly suggest that 2019 AQ3 is only the tip of the iceberg: a likely numerous population of similar bodies may remain hidden in plain sight, permanently confined inside the Sun's glare.","C. de la Fuente Marcos, R. de la Fuente Marcos","11 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables.

171,"We study a discrete flavour symmetric scenario for neutrino mass and dark matter under the circumstances where such global discrete symmetries can be explicitly broken at Planck scale, possibly by gravitational effects. Such explicit breaking of discrete symmetries mimic as Planck suppressed operators in the model which can have non-trivial consequences for neutrino and dark matter sectors. In particular, we study a flavour symmetric model which, at renormalisable level, gives rise to tri-bimaximal type neutrino mixing with vanishing reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}=0$, a stable inert scalar doublet behaving like a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and a stable singlet inert fermion which does not interact with any other particles. The introduction of Planck suppressed operators which explicitly break the discrete symmetries, can give rise to the generation of non-zero $\theta_{13}$ in agreement with neutrino data and also open up decay channels of inert scalar doublet into singlet neutral inert fermion leading to the realisation of the super-WIMP dark matter scenario. We show that the correct neutrino phenomenology can be obtained in this model while discussing three distinct realisation of the super-WIMP dark matter scenario.","Debasish Borah, Biswajit Karmakar, Dibyendu Nanda","35 pages, 12 figures",1906.02756v1,No journal ref found,Dibyendu Nanda,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02756v1,2019-06-06 18:00:22+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Planck Scale Origin of Non-zero $θ_{13}$ and Super-WIMP Dark Matter,2019-06-06 18:00:22+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02756v1
172,"We perform simulations of giant impacts onto the young Uranus using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with over 100 million particles. This 100--1000$\times$ improvement in particle number reveals that simulations with below 10^7 particles fail to converge on even bulk properties like the post-impact rotation period, or on the detailed erosion of the atmosphere. Higher resolutions appear to determine these large-scale results reliably, but even 10^8 particles may not be sufficient to study the detailed composition of the debris -- finding that almost an order of magnitude more rock is ejected beyond the Roche radius than with 10^5 particles. We present two software developments that enable this increase in the feasible number of particles. First, we present an algorithm to place any number of particles in a spherical shell such that they all have an SPH density within 1% of the desired value. Particles in model planets built from these nested shells have a root-mean-squared velocity below 1% of the escape speed, which avoids the need for long precursor simulations to produce relaxed initial conditions. Second, we develop the hydrodynamics code SWIFT for planetary simulations.

173,"In simple models of the Milky Way, tidally disrupting satellites produce long and thin---nearly one-dimensional---stellar streams. Using astrometric data from the Gaia second data release and photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, we demonstrate that the Jhelum stream, a stellar stream in the inner halo, is a two-dimensional structure. The spatial distribution of highly probable Jhelum members reveals a dense thin component and an associated diffuse, spatially offset component. These two spatial components have indistinguishable proper motions (at $\sigma\sim1\,\rm mas\,yr^{-1}$ level) and a similar ratio of blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, which indicates a common origin for the two components. The best-fit orbit to the narrow component (pericenter $8\,\rm kpc$, apocenter $24\,\rm kpc$), however, does not explain the wide component of the Jhelum stream. On the other hand, an older orbital wrap of Jhelum's orbit traces the Indus stream, indicating a possible connection between these two structures and additional complexity in Jhelum's formation. Substructure in the Jhelum progenitor or precession of its tidal debris in the Milky Way potential may explain the observed structure of Jhelum. Future spectroscopic data will enable discrimination between these ""nature"" and ""nurture"" formation scenarios. Jhelum adds to the growing list of cold stellar streams that display complex morphologies and promise to reveal the dynamical history of the Milky Way.","Ana Bonaca, Charlie Conroy, Adrian M.

174,"Supermassive black hole feedback is thought to be responsible for the lack of star formation, or quiescence, in a significant fraction of galaxies. We explore how observable correlations between the specific star formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass (M$_{\rm{star}}$), and black hole mass (M$_{\rm{BH}}$) are sensitive to the physics of black hole feedback in a galaxy formation model. We use the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, specifically the TNG100 simulation and ten model variations that alter the parameters of the black hole model. Focusing on central galaxies at $z = 0$ with M$_{\rm{star}} > 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, we find that the sSFR of galaxies in IllustrisTNG decreases once the energy from black hole kinetic winds at low accretion rates becomes larger than the gravitational binding energy of gas within the galaxy stellar radius. This occurs at a particular M$_{\rm{BH}}$ threshold above which galaxies are found to sharply transition from being mostly star-forming to mostly quiescent. As a result of this behavior, the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of M$_{\rm{star}}$ is sensitive to both the normalization of the M$_{\rm{BH}}$-M$_{\rm{star}}$ relation and the M$_{\rm{BH}}$ threshold for quiescence in IllustrisTNG. Finally, we compare these model results to observations of 91 central galaxies with dynamical M$_{\rm{BH}}$ measurements with the caveat that this sample is not representative of the whole galaxy population. While IllustrisTNG reproduces the observed trend that quiescent galaxies host more massive black holes, the observations exhibit a broader scatter in M$_{\rm{BH}}$ at a given M$_{\rm{star}}$ and show a smoother decline in sSFR with M$_{\rm{BH}}$.","Bryan A.

176,"This paper investigates the impact of the increased reaction rate constant due to tunneling effects on planet-forming disks. Our aim is to quantify the astrophysical implications of atom tunneling for simple molecules that are frequently used to infer disk structure information or to define the initial conditions for planet (atmosphere) formation. We explain the tunneling effect on reaction rates by using a scholarly example in comparison to previous UMIST2012 rate constants. In a chemical network with 1299 reactions, we identify all reactions that could show atom tunneling. We devise a simple formulation of reaction rate constants that overestimates tunneling and screen a standard T Tauri disk model for changes in species abundances. For those reactions found to be relevant, we find values of the most recent literature for the rate constants including tunneling and compare the resulting disk chemistry to the standard disk models. The rate constants in the UMIST2012 database in many cases already capture tunneling effects implicitly. A rigorous screening procedure identified three neutral-neutral reactions where atom tunneling could change simple molecule abundances. However, by adopting recent values of the rate constants of these reactions and due to the layered structure of planet-forming disks, the effects are limited to a small region where cold neutral-neutral chemistry dominates. Abundances of water close to the midplane snowline can increase by a factor of two at most compared to previous results with UMIST2012 rates. Observables from the disk surface, such as high excitation (> 500 K) water line fluxes, decrease by 60% at most when tunneling effects are explicitly excluded. On the other hand, disk midplane quantities relevant for planet formation such as the C-to-O ratio and also the ice-to-rock ratio are clearly affected by these gas-phase tunneling effects.","Jan Meisner, Inga Kamp, Wing-Fai Thi, Johannes Kästner","17 pages, 12 Figures in main Text.

177,"We introduce an emulator approach to predict the non-linear matter power spectrum for broad classes of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, using only a suite of $\Lambda$CDM $N$-body simulations. By including a range of suitably modified initial conditions in the simulations, and rescaling the resulting emulator predictions with analytical `halo model reactions', accurate non-linear matter power spectra for general extensions to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model can be calculated. We optimise the emulator design by substituting the simulation suite with non-linear predictions from the standard {\sc halofit} tool. We review the performance of the emulator for artificially generated departures from the standard cosmology as well as for theoretically motivated models, such as $f (R)$ gravity and massive neutrinos. For the majority of cosmologies we have tested, the emulator can reproduce the matter power spectrum with errors $\lesssim 1\%$ deep into the highly non-linear regime. This work demonstrates that with a well-designed suite of $\Lambda$CDM simulations, extensions to the standard cosmological model can be tested in the non-linear regime without any reliance on expensive beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations.","Benjamin Giblin, Matteo Cataneo, Ben Moews, Catherine Heymans","16 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1906.02742v1,No journal ref found,Catherine Heymans,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02742v1,2019-06-06 17:56:57+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,On the road to per cent level accuracy II: calibration of the non-linear   matter power spectrum for arbitrary cosmologies,2019-06-06 17:56:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02742v1
178,"We present the $0.6<z<2.6$ evolution of the ionized gas velocity dispersion in 175 star-forming disk galaxies based on data from the full KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ integral field spectroscopic survey. In a forward-modelling Bayesian framework including instrumental effects and beam-smearing, we fit simultaneously the observed galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion along the kinematic major axis to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$. We find a reduction of the average intrinsic velocity dispersion of disk galaxies as a function of cosmic time, from $\sigma_0\sim45$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.3$ to $\sigma_0\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim0.9$. There is substantial intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{\sigma_0, {\rm int}}\approx10$ km s$^{-1}$) around the best-fit $\sigma_0-z$-relation beyond what can be accounted for from the typical measurement uncertainties ($\delta\sigma_0\approx12$ km s$^{-1}$), independent of other identifiable galaxy parameters. This potentially suggests a dynamic mechanism such as minor mergers or variation in accretion being responsible for the scatter. Putting our data into the broader literature context, we find that ionized and atomic+molecular velocity dispersions evolve similarly with redshift, with the ionized gas dispersion being $\sim10-15$ km s$^{-1}$ higher on average. We investigate the physical driver of the on average elevated velocity dispersions at higher redshift, and find that our galaxies are at most marginally Toomre-stable, suggesting that their turbulent velocities are powered by gravitational instabilities, while stellar feedback as a driver alone is insufficient. This picture is supported through comparison with a state-of-the-art analytical model of galaxy evolution.","Hannah D. N. Übler, Reinhard Genzel, Emily Wisnioski, Natascha M. Förster Schreiber, T.

179,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) display complex X-ray spectra which exhibit a variety of emission and absorption features, that are commonly interpreted as a combination of i) a relativistically smeared reflection component, resulting from the irradiation of an accretion disk by a compact hard X-ray source, ii) one or several warm/ionized absorption components produced by AGN-driven outflows crossing our line of sight, and iii) a non relativistic reflection component produced by more distant material. Disentangling these components via detailed model fitting can thus be used to constrain the black hole spin, the geometry and characteristics of the accretion flow, as well as of the outflows and surroundings of the black hole. We investigate how a high throughput high resolution X-ray spectrometer, such as the Athena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) can be used to this aim, using the state of the art reflection model Relxill in a lamp post geometrical configuration. We simulate a representative sample of AGN spectra, including all necessary model complexities, as well as a range of model parameters going from standard to more extreme values, and considered X-ray fluxes that are representative of known AGN and Quasars (QSOs) populations. We also present a method to estimate the systematic errors related to the uncertainties in the calibration of the X-IFU. In a conservative setting, in which the reflection component is computed self consistently by the Relxill model from the pre-set geometry and no iron over abundance, the mean errors on the spin and height of the irradiating source are <0.05 and ~0.2 Rg. Similarly the absorber parameters are measured to an accuracy typically less than ~5%. Extending the simulations to include blue shifted ultra fast outflows, we show that X-IFU could measure their velocity with statistical errors <1% even for high redshift objects (abridged).","Didier Barret, Massimo Cappi","Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 23 pages, 12

180,"Context. The youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 is an interesting target for next generation gamma-ray observatories. So far, the remnant is only detected in the radio and the X-ray bands, but its young age of ~100 yrs and inferred shock speed of ~14,000 km/s could make it an efficient particle accelerator. Aims. We aim to model the observed radio and X-ray spectra together with the morphology of the remnant. At the same time, we aim to estimate the gamma-ray flux from the source and evaluated the prospects of its detection with future gamma-ray experiments. Methods. We performed spherical symmetric 1-D simulations with the RATPaC code, in which we simultaneously solve the transport equation for cosmic rays, the transport equation for magnetic turbulence, and the hydro-dynamical equations for the gas flow. Separately computed distributions of the particles accelerated at the forward and the reverse shock are then used to calculate the spectra of synchrotron, inverse Compton, and pion-decay radiation from the source. Results. The emission from G1.9+0.3 can be self-consistently explained within the test-particle limit. We find that the X-ray flux is dominated by emission from the forward shock while most of the radio emission originates near the reverse shock, which makes G1.9+0.3 the first remnant with non-thermal radiation detected from the reverse shock. The flux of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from G1.9+0.3 is expected to be close to the sensitivity threshold of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA. The limited time available to grow large-scale turbulence limits the maximum energy of particles to values below 100 TeV, hence G1.9+0.3 is not a PeVatron.","R. Brose, I. Sushch, M. Pohl, K. J.

In this setup, we attempt to obtain large effective axion decay constant in two different ways: by searching for a direction in field space in which the potential is sufficiently flat and by arriving at a very explicit stringy embedding of the Kim-Nilles-Peloso (KNP) alignment mechanism.

Spatial distributions of water vapor, clouds, and surface ice are controlled by climate. In turn, water, in each of its thermodynamic phases, imposes significant modulations to thermal and reflected planetary spectra. Here we explore these characteristic spectral signals, based on 3D climate simulations of Earth-sized aquaplanets orbiting M dwarf stars near the habitable zone. By using 3D models, we can self-consistently predict surface temperatures and the location of water vapor, clouds, and surface ice in the climate system. Habitable zone planets in M dwarf systems are expected to be in synchronous rotation with their host star and thus present distinct differences in emitted and reflected energy fluxes depending on the observed hemisphere. Here we illustrate that icy, temperate, and incipient runaway greenhouse climate states exhibit phase-dependent spectral signals that enable their characterization.","E. T. Wolf, R. K. Kopparapu, J.

184,"Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact binaries, together with an associated electromagnetic counterpart, are ideal probes of cosmological models. As demonstrated with GW170817, such multimessenger observations allow one to use the source as a standard siren, analog of standard candles in conventional astronomy, in order to measure cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant. No cosmological ladder is needed to estimate the source luminosity distance from the detected gravitational waves. The error on the luminosity distance plays a crucial r\^ole in the error budget for the inference of the Hubble constant. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the statistical errors on the luminosity distance inferred from gravitational wave data as a function of the sky position and the detector network. In particular, we take into account degeneracy in the parameter space of the gravitational waveform showing that in certain conditions on the gravitational-wave detector network and the source sky position it may not be possible to estimate the luminosity distance of the source. Our analytic approximants shows a good agreement with the uncertainties measured with Bayesian samplers and simulated data. We also present implications for the estimation error on the Hubble constant.","E. Chassande-Mottin, K. Leyde, S. Mastrogiovanni, D. A.

185,"We demonstrate that planet occurrence does not depend on stellar galactocentric velocity in the Solar neighborhood. Using Gaia DR2 astrometry and radial velocity data, we calculate 3D galactocentric velocities for 197,090 Kepler field stars, 1647 of which are confirmed planet hosts. When we compare the galactocentric velocities of planet hosts to those of the entire field star sample, we observe a statistically significant (KS p-value = $10^{-70}$) distinction, with planet hosts being apparently slower than field stars by $\sim$40 km/s. We explore some potential explanations for this difference and conclude that it is not a consequence of the planet-metallicity relation or distinctions in the samples' thin/thick disk membership, but rather an artefact of Kepler's selection function. Non Kepler-host stars that have nearly identical distances, temperatures, surface gravities, and Kepler magnitudes to the confirmed planet hosts also have nearly identical velocity distributions. Using one of these identical non-host samples, we consider that the probability of a star with velocity $v_{\mathrm{tot}}$ hosting a planet can be described by an exponential function proportional to $e^{(-v_{\mathrm{tot}}/v_0)}$. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, we determine that $v_0 > $976 km/s to 99% confidence, which implies that planets in the Solar neighborhood are just as likely to form around fast stars as they are around slow stars. Our work highlights the subtle ways in which selection biases can create strong correlations without physical underpinnings.","Moiya McTier, David Kipping",Subitted to MNRAS on May 31 2019,1906.02663v1,No journal ref found,David Kipping,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02663v1,2019-06-06 16:03:12+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Not Gone with the Wind: Planet Occurrence is Independent of Stellar   Galactocentric Velocity,2019-06-06 16:03:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02663v1
186,"The EDGES collaboration reported the finding of an unexpectedly deep absorption in the radio background at 78 MHz and interpreted the dip as a first detection of redshifted 21-cm from Cosmic Dawn. We have attempted an alternate analysis, adopting a maximally smooth function approach to model the foreground. A joint fit to the spectrum using such a function together with a flattened absorption profile yields a best fit absorption amplitude of $921 \pm 35$ mK. The depth of the 21-cm absorption inferred by the EDGES analysis required invoking non-standard cosmology or new physics or new sources at Cosmic Dawn and this tension with accepted models is compounded by our analysis that suggests absorption of greater depth. Alternatively, the measured spectrum may be equally-well fit assuming that there exists a residual unmodeled systematic sinusoidal feature and we explore this possibility further by examining for any additional 21-cm signal. The data then favors an absorption with Gaussian model parameters of amplitude $133 \pm 60$ mK, best width at half-power $9 \pm 3$ MHz and center frequency $72.5 \pm 0.8$ MHz. We also examine the consistency of the measured spectrum with plausible redshifted 21-cm models: a set of 3 of the 265 profiles in the global 21-cm atlas of Cohen et al. 2017 are favored by the spectrum. We conclude that the EDGES data may be consistent with standard cosmology and astrophysics, without invoking excess radio backgrounds or baryon-dark matter interactions.","Saurabh Singh, Ravi Subrahmanyan",Accepted for publication in ApJ,1903.04540v2,No journal ref found,Ravi Subrahmanyan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04540v2,2019-03-11 18:53:27+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.IM,The redshifted 21-cm signal in the EDGES low-band spectrum,2019-06-06 15:36:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04540v2
187,"Isolated spinning neutron stars, asymmetric with respect to their rotation axis, are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves. The most sensitive searches for these sources are based on accurate matched filtering techniques, that assume the continuous wave to be phase-locked with the pulsar beamed emission. While matched filtering maximizes the search sensitivity, a significant signal-to-noise ratio loss will happen in case of a mismatch between the assumed and the true signal phase evolution. Narrow-band algorithms allow for a small mismatch in the frequency and spin-down values of the pulsar while integrating coherently the entire data set. In this paper we describe a narrow-band search using LIGO O2 data for the continuous wave emission of 33 pulsars. No evidence for a continuous wave signal has been found and upper-limits on the gravitational wave amplitude, over the analyzed frequency and spin-down volume, have been computed for each of the targets. In this search we have surpassed the spin-down limit for some of the pulsars already present in the O1 LIGO narrow-band search, such as J1400\textminus6325 J1813\textminus1246, J1833\textminus1034, J1952+3252, and for new targets such as J0940\textminus5428 and J1747\textminus2809. For J1400\textminus6325, J1833\textminus1034 and J1747\textminus2809 this is the first time the spin-down limit is surpassed.","The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, B. P.

188,"Exoplanets with substantial Hydrogen/Helium atmospheres have been discovered in abundance, many residing extremely close to their parent stars. The extreme irradiation levels these atmospheres experience causes them to undergo hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Ongoing atmospheric escape has been observed to be occurring in a few nearby exoplanet systems through transit spectroscopy both for hot Jupiters and lower-mass super-Earths/mini-Neptunes. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations that incorporate radiative transfer and ionization chemistry are now common in one-dimensional models, and multi-dimensional calculations that incorporate magnetic-fields and interactions with the interstellar environment are cutting edge. However, there remains very limited comparison between simulations and observations. While hot Jupiters experience atmospheric escape, the mass-loss rates are not high enough to affect their evolution. However, for lower mass planets atmospheric escape drives and controls their evolution, sculpting the exoplanet population we observe today.",James E.

189,"We present the detection of fullerenes C_60 and C_70 in gas of the star-forming region IC 348 of the Perseus molecular cloud. Mid-IR vibrational transitions of C_60 and C_70 in emission are found in Spitzer IRS spectra of individual stars (LRLL 1, 2, 58), in the averaged spectrum of three other cluster stars (LRLL 21, 31 and 67) and in gas spectra obtained at four interstellar locations distributed across the IC 348 region. Fullerene bands appear widely distributed in the interstellar medium of this star-forming region with higher strength in the lines of sight of stars at the core of the cluster. An estimate of fullerene abundances in the intervening gas is provided adopting literature values for the average intensity of the UV radiation field in the cluster. Emission features consistent with the three most intense bands of the C_60^+ and with one of C_60^- are also found in the spectra, if ascribed to these ionized species it would imply ionization fractions at 20 and 10 %, respectively. All the stars under consideration host protoplanetary disks, however the available data lack the spatial resolution required to disentangle the presence of fullerenes in the disks. If fullerene abundances in the cloud were representative of IC 348 protoplanetary disks, C_60, the most abundant of the two species, could host \sim 0.1 % of the total available carbon in the disks. This shall encourage dedicated searches in young disks with upcoming facilities as JWST. Fullerenes provide a reservoir of pentagonal and hexagonal carbon rings which could be important as building blocks of prebiotic molecules. Accretion of these robust molecules in early phases of planet formation may contribute to the formation of complex organic molecules in young planets.",S. Iglesias-Groth,"7 figures, 10 pages.

190,"We present the analysis of stellar binary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0060 based on observations obtained from 13 different telescopes. Intensive coverage of the anomalous parts of the light curve was achieved by automated follow-up observations from the robotic telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory. We show that, for the first time, all main features of an anomalous microlensing event are well covered by follow-up data, allowing us to estimate the physical parameters of the lens. The strong detection of second-order effects in the event light curve necessitates the inclusion of longer-baseline survey data in order to constrain the parallax vector. We find that the event was most likely caused by a stellar binary-lens with masses $M_{\star1} = 0.87 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\star2} = 0.77 \pm 0.11 M_{\odot}$.

191,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a mysterious flash phenomenon detected in radio wavelengths with a duration of only a few milliseconds, and they may also have prompt gamma-ray flashes. Here we carry out a blind search for msec-duration gamma-ray flashes using the 7-year Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) all-sky gamma-ray data. About 100 flash candidates are detected, but after removing those associated with bright steady point sources, we find no flash events at high Galactic latitude region (|b|>20 deg). Events at lower latitude regions are consistent with statistical flukes originating from the diffuse gamma-ray background. From these results, we place an upper limit on the GeV gamma-ray to radio flux ratio of FRBs as xi \equiv (nu L_nu)_gamma / (nu L_nu)_radio < 10^8, depending on the assumed FRB rate evolution. This limit is comparable with the largest value found for pulsars, though xi of pulsars is distributed in a wide range. We also compare this limit with the spectral energy distribution of the 2004 giant flare of the magnetar SGR 1806-20.","Shotaro Yamasaki, Tomonori Totani, Norita Kawanaka","Published in MNRAS, 7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",1604.03077v2,No journal ref found,Norita Kawanaka,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03077v2,2016-04-11 19:33:44+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,A Blind Search for Prompt Gamma-ray Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts   with Fermi-LAT Data,2019-06-06 14:05:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03077v2

193,"Context. The benchmark open cluster M67 is known to have solar metallicity and similar age as the Sun. It thus provides us a great opportunity to study the properties of solar twins, as well as the evolution of Sun-like stars. Aims. Previous spectroscopic studies reported to detect possible subtle changes in stellar surface abundances throughout the stellar evolutionary phase, namely the effect of atomic diffusion, in M67. In this study we attempt to confirm and quantify more precisely the effect of atomic diffusion, as well as to explore the level of chemical (in)homogeneity in M67. Methods. We presented a strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two groups of stars in M67: three turn-off stars and three sub-giants. Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained with very high precision using the Keck/HIRES spectra. Results. The sub-giants in our sample show negligible abundance variations ($\le$ 0.02 dex), which implies that M67 was born chemically homogeneous. We note there is a significant abundance difference ($\sim$ 0.1 - 0.2 dex) between sub-giants and turn-off stars, which can be interpreted as the signature of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models with diffusion agree with the observed abundance results. Some turn-off stars do not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases diffusion can be inhibited, or they might suffered some sort of mixing event related to planets. Conclusions. Our results pose additional challenges for chemical tagging when using turn-off stars. In particular, the effects of atomic diffusion, which could be as large as 0.1 - 0.2 dex, must be taken into account in order for chemical tagging to be successfully applied.","F. Liu, M. Asplund, D.

194,"Transiently accreting neutron stars (NSs) in LMXBs undergo episodes of accretion, alternated with periods of quiescence. During an accretion outburst, the NS heats up due to exothermic accretion-induced processes taking place in the crust. Most of this heat slowly diffuses into the stellar core on a thermal diffusion time scale of years. Over many accretion outburst cycles, an equilibrium state is reached when the core temperature is high enough that the heating and cooling (photon and neutrino emission) processes are in balance with each other. Here we present a parameter study to investigate how stellar characteristics and outburst properties affect the long-term temperature evolution of a transiently accreting neutron star. For the first time, not only the effects of the core, but also the crustal properties are considered, in particular that of shallow heating. We track the thermal evolution of a NS undergoing accretion outbursts over a period of $10^5$ yr using our code NSCool. The outburst sequence is based on the regular outbursts observed from the NS X-ray transient Aql X-1. We calculate for each model the time scale over which equilibrium is reached and present these along with the temperature and luminosity parameters of the equilibrium state. We find that shallow heating significant contributes to the equilibrium state. Increasing its strength raises the equilibrium core temperature, while the depth of the shallow heat has a smaller effect on the long-term equilibrium state. We find that if deep crustal heating is replaced by shallow heating alone, the core would still heat up, reaching only a 2% lower equilibrium core temperature than if the star was only heated by deep crustal heating. Deep crustal heating may therefore not be vital to the heating of the core. Additionally, shallow heating can increase the quiescence luminosity to values higher than previously expected.","L. S.

195,"Analysis of the Planck 2018 data set indicates that the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies are in excellent agreement with previous studies using the 2013 and 2015 data releases. In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several so-called ""anomalies"" on large angular scales. The novelty of the current study, however, lies in being a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales, using either maps of the Stokes parameters, $Q$ and $U$, or the $E$-mode signal derived from these using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although remarkable progress has been made in reducing the systematic effects that contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular scales, it is still the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null tests applied to the maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the analysis on intermediate and large angular scales (i.e., $\ell \lesssim 400$). In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological non-Gaussianity, or of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably, the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of temperature hot and cold spots exhibits excellent agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear indication of how Planck provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and polarization on degree scales.","Planck Collaboration, Y.

197,"We report observations and analysis of the nearby gamma-ray burst GRB\,161219B (redshift $z=0.1475$) and the associated Type Ic supernova (SN) 2016jca. GRB\,161219B had an isotropic gamma-ray energy of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{50}$\,erg. Its afterglow is likely refreshed at an epoch preceding the first photometric points (0.6\,d), which slows down the decay rates. Combined analysis of the SN light curve and multiwavelength observations of the afterglow suggest that the GRB jet was broad during the afterglow phase (full opening angle $\sim 42^\circ \pm 3^\circ$). Our spectral series shows broad absorption lines typical of GRB supernovae (SNe), which testify to the presence of material with velocities up to $\sim 0.25$c. The spectrum at 3.73\,d allows for the very early identification of a SN associated with a GRB. Reproducing it requires a large photospheric velocity ($35,000 \pm 7000$\,\kms). The kinetic energy of the SN is estimated through models to be \KE $\approx 4 \times 10^{52}$\,erg in spherical symmetry. The ejected mass in the explosion was \Mej $\approx 6.5 \pm 1.5$\,\Msun, much less than that of other GRB-SNe, demonstrating diversity among these events. The total amount of \Nifs\ in the explosion was $0.27 \pm 0.05$\,\Msun. The observed spectra require the presence of freshly synthesised \Nifs\ at the highest velocities, at least 3 times more than a standard GRB-SN. We also find evidence for a decreasing \Nifs\ abundance as a function of decreasing velocity. This suggests that SN\,2016jca was a highly aspherical explosion viewed close to on-axis, powered by a compact remnant. Applying a typical correction for asymmetry, the energy of SN\,2016jca was $\sim$ (1--3) $\times 10^{52}$\,erg, confirming that most of the energy produced by GRB-SNe goes into the kinetic energy of the SN ejecta.","C.

198,"On July 25 2017 a multi-step Forbush decrease (FD) with the remarkable total amplitude of more than 15\% was observed by MSL/RAD at Mars. We find that these particle signatures are related to very pronounced plasma and magnetic field signatures detected in situ by STEREO-A on July 24 2017, with a higher than average total magnetic field strength reaching more than 60 nT. In the observed time period STEREO-A was at a relatively small longitudinal separation (46 degrees) to Mars and both were located at the back side of the Sun as viewed from Earth. We analyse a number of multi-spacecraft and multi-instrument (both in situ and remote-sensing) observations, and employ modelling to understand these signatures. We find that the solar sources are two CMEs which erupted on July 23 2017 from the same source region on the back side of the Sun as viewed from Earth. Moreover, we find that the two CMEs interact non-uniformly, inhibiting the expansion of one of the CMEs in STEREO-A direction, whereas allowing it to expand more freely in the Mars direction. The interaction of the two CMEs with the ambient solar wind adds up to the complexity of the event, resulting in a long, sub-structured interplanetary disturbance at Mars, where different sub-structures correspond to different steps of the FD, adding-up to a globally large-amplitude FD.","Mateja Dumbovic, Jingnan Guo, Manuela Temmer, M.

Stellar mass twin configurations are obtained if a strong first-order phase transition occurs in the interior of a compact star. In the mass-radius diagram of compact stars, this will lead to a third branch of gravitationally stable stars with features that are very distinctive from those of white dwarfs and neutron stars. We discuss rotating hybrid star sequences in the slow rotation approximation and in full general relativity and draw conclusions for an upper limit on the maximum mass of nonrotating compact stars that has recently be deduced from the observation of the merger event GW170817.","David Blaschke, David Edwin Alvarez-Castillo, Alexander Ayriyan, Hovik Grigorian, Noshad Khosravi Lagarni, Fridolin Weber","47 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables, chapter in ""Topics in Strong Gravity:

200,"We examine the potential multi-messenger role of BL Lac objects emitting at high energy (so-called HBL) focusing on the limits on the energy density of soft radiation in the jet frame, a critical parameter which regulates the proton cooling and the fragmentation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei possibly accelerated in the jet. We show that (under the assumption that the high-energy emission bump is dominated by inverse Compton emission) the energy density of any external soft radiation field (e.g. produced by a layer surrounding the jet or in the accretion flow) cannot be larger than few times that associated to the observed synchrotron radiation produced in the emission region. Quite interestingly, the constraint that we derive is generally stronger than the limit obtained from the condition that the source is transparent to very-high energy $\gamma$-rays. Using this constraint we can derive a robust upper limit for the efficiency of the photopion reaction leading to the emission of PeV neutrinos, $f_{\pi}\lesssim 10^{-5}$, which makes HBL quite inefficient neutrino sources. For the photodisintegration of nuclei the results are more dependent on the spectral properties of the radiation field. The photodisintegration efficiency is safely below 1 (and nuclei can escape intact) for a `canonical' spectrum of the soft radiation field $\propto \nu^{-0.5}$.

201,"Transitional millisecond pulsars provide a unique set of observational data for understanding accretion at low rates onto magnetized neutron stars. In particular, PSR~J1023+0038 exhibits a remarkable bimodality of the X-ray luminosity (low and high modes), pulsations extending from the X-ray to the optical band, GeV emission, and occasional X-ray flares. We discuss a scenario for the pulsar interaction with the accretion disk capable of explaining the observed behavior. We suggest that during the high mode the disk is truncated outside the light cylinder, allowing the pulsar wind to develop near the equatorial plane and strike the disk. The dissipative wind-disk collision energizes the disk particles and generates synchrotron emission, which peaks in the X-ray band and extends down to the optical band. The emission is modulated by the pulsar wind rotation, resulting in a pulse profile with two peaks 180\degr\ apart. This picture explains the high-mode luminosity, spectrum, and pulse profile (X-ray and optical) of PSR J1023+0038. It may also explain the X-ray flares as events of sudden increase in the effective disk cross section intercepting the wind. In contrast to previously proposed models, we suggest that the disk penetrates the light cylinder only during the low X-ray mode. This penetration suppresses the dissipation caused by the pulsar wind-disk collision, and the system enters the propeller regime. The small duty cycle of the propeller explains the low spindown rate of the pulsar.","Alexandra Veledina, Joonas Nättilä, Andrei M.

We show that CR can reach the Hillas (1984) energy even if the magnetised turbulence in the flux tube is not sufficiently strong for Bohm diffusion to apply. First-order Fermi acceleration by successive weak shocks in a hydromagnetic flux tube is shown to be equivalent to second-order Fermi acceleration by strong turbulence.,"Anthony Bell, James Matthews, Katherine Blundell, Anabella Araudo","Accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal

This issue can be resolved by removing any existing degeneracy present in such theories. We consider a model involving at most second order derivatives of scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature terms. Here we perform (3+1) decomposition of Lagrangian to separate second order time derivative form the rest. This is useful to check the degeneracy hidden in the Lagrangian will help us to find conditions under which Ostrogradsky instability do not appear.

204,"In the context of the upcoming SRG/eROSITA survey, we present an N-body simulation-based mock catalogue for X-ray selected AGN samples. The model reproduces the observed hard X-ray AGN luminosity function (XLF) and the soft X-ray logN-logS from redshift 0 to 6. The XLF is reproduced to within $\pm5\%$ and the logN-logS to within $\pm20\%$. We develop a joint X-ray -- optical extinction and classification model. We adopt a set of empirical spectral energy distributions to predict observed magnitudes in the UV, optical and NIR. With the latest eROSITA all sky survey sensitivity model, we create a high-fidelity full-sky mock catalogue of X-ray AGN. It predicts their distributions in right ascension, declination, redshift and fluxes. Using empirical medium resolution optical spectral templates and an exposure time calculator, we find that $1.1\times10^6$ ($4\times10^5$) fiber-hours are needed to follow-up spectroscopically from the ground the detected X-ray AGN with an optical magnitude $21<r<22.8$ ($22.8<r<25$) with a 4-m (8-m) class multi-object spectroscopic facility. We find that future clustering studies will measure the AGN bias to the percent level at redshift $z<1.2$ and should discriminate possible scenarios of galaxy-AGN co-evolution. We predict the accuracy to which the baryon acoustic oscillation standard ruler will be measured using X-ray AGN: better than 3\% for AGN between redshift 0.5 to 3 and better than 1\% using the Ly$\alpha$ forest of X-ray QSOs discovered between redshift 2 and 3. eROSITA will provide an outstanding set of targets for future galaxy evolution and cosmological studies.","J.

205,"Cosmic reionization was driven by the imbalance between early sources and sinks of ionizing radiation, both of which were dominated by small-scale structure and are thus usually treated in cosmological reionization simulations by subgrid modelling. The recombination rate of intergalactic hydrogen is customarily boosted by a subgrid clumping factor, ${\left<n^2\right>/\left<n\right>^2}$, which corrects for unresolved fluctuations in gas density ${n}$ on scales below the grid-spacing of coarse-grained simulations. We investigate in detail the impact of this inhomogeneous subgrid clumping on reionization and its observables, as follows: (1) Previous attempts generally underestimated the clumping factor because of insufficient mass resolution. We perform a high-resolution $N$-body simulation that resolves haloes down to the pre-reionization Jeans mass to derive the time-dependent, spatially-varying local clumping factor and a fitting formula for its correlation with local overdensity. (2) We then perform a large-scale $N$-body and radiative transfer simulation that accounts for this inhomogeneous subgrid clumping by applying this clumping factor-overdensity correlation. Boosting recombination significantly slows the expansion of ionized regions, which delays completion of reionization and suppresses 21 cm power spectra on large scales in the later stages of reionization. (3) We also consider a simplified prescription in which the globally-averaged, time-evolving clumping factor from the same high-resolution $N$-body simulation is applied uniformly to all cells in the reionization simulation, instead. Observables computed with this model agree fairly well with those from the inhomogeneous clumping model, e.g. predicting 21 cm power spectra to within 20% error, suggesting it may be a useful approximation.","Yi Mao, Jun Koda, Paul R.

206,"High inclination black hole X-ray binaries exhibit blueshifted ionized absorption lines from disk winds, whose launching mechanism is still in debate. The lines are predominantly observed in the high/soft state and disappear in the low/hard state. We have tested if the thermal winds, which are driven by the irradiation of the outer disk by the X-rays from the inner disk, can explain these observed properties, by comparing the model developed by Done et al. (2018) and actual X-ray data of H 1743-322 in previous outbursts. Applying the model to the broad-band X-ray continuum profiles determined with the data from RXTE monitoring, we have calculated observable quantities of thermal winds (the column density and the ionization parameter) over the outburst periods. We performed spectral simulations using these quantities, to predict the absorption feature at the epochs of Chandra high resolution spectroscopy in the high/soft state and the low/hard state. The model was found to well reproduce the observed lines in the high/soft state, and also successfully predicted their disappearance in the low/hard state. These results indicate that the evolution of observed wind properties during outbursts can be explained by the thermal wind model.","M. Shidatsu, C.

207,"Complex radiative transfer (RT) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons poses a theoretical challenge to galaxy surveys which infer the large-scale structure with Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Guided by RT simulations, prior studies investigated the impact of RT on the large-scale LAE clustering, and claimed that RT induces a selection effect which results in an anisotropic distortion even in real space but in an otherwise negligible effect in redshift space. However, our previous study, which relies on a full radiative transfer code run on the Illustris simulations, shows that the anisotropic selection effect was drastically reduced with higher spatial resolution. Adopting the same simulation framework, we further study the impact of RT on the LAE clustering in redshift space. Since we measure LAE's radial position through a spectral peak of a Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, the frequency shift due to RT contaminates the redshift measurement and hence the inferred radial position in redshift space. We demonstrate that this additional RT offset suppresses the LAE clustering along the line of sight, which can be interpreted as a novel Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect. To assess the FoG effect, we develop a theoretical framework with particular emphasis on its connection with the underlying one-point velocity distribution which simultaneously takes into account the RT offset as well as the peculiar velocity that is commonly studied in the context of the Redshift Space Distortion (RSD). Although our findings strongly encourage a more careful RSD modeling in LAE surveys, we also seek a method to mitigate the additional FoG effect due to RT by making use of other information in a Lyman-$\alpha$ spectrum.","Chris Byrohl, Shun Saito, Christoph Behrens",No comment found,1906.02173v2,No journal ref found,Christoph Behrens,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02173v2,2019-06-05 17:59:12+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Radiative Transfer Distortions of Lyman-$α$ Emitters: a New   Fingers-of-God Damping in the Clustering in Redshift Space,2019-06-06 08:10:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02173v2

We demonstrate that, with such approach, accurate multi-band photometry allows to estimate reliable SFRs. We also investigate how the use of photometric rather than spectroscopic redshifts, affects the accuracy of derived global SFRs.

210,"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a European Space Agency mission that aims to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz range. Laser frequency noise enters the interferometric measurements and dominates the expected gravitational signals by many orders of magnitude. Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a technique that reduces this laser noise by synthesizing virtual equal-arm interferometric measurements. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have confirmed that this reduction is sufficient to meet the scientific goals of the mission in proof-of-concept setups. In this paper, we show that the on-board antialiasing filters play an important role in TDI's performance when the flexing of the constellation is accounted for. This coupling was neglected in previous studies. To reach an optimal reduction level, filters with vanishing group delays must be used on board or synthesized off-line. We propose a theoretical model of the residual laser noise including this flexing-filtering coupling. We also use two independent simulators to produce realistic measurement signals and compute the corresponding TDI Michelson variables. We show that our theoretical model agrees with the simulated data with exquisite precision. Using these two complementary approaches, we confirm TDI's ability to reduce laser frequency noise in a more realistic mission setup. The theoretical model provides insight on filter design and implementation.","Jean-Baptiste Bayle, Marc Lilley, Antoine Petiteau, Hubert Halloin","15 pages, 7 figures",1811.01575v5,No journal ref found,Hubert Halloin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01575v5,2018-11-05 09:51:57+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM,Effect of filters on the time-delay interferometry residual laser noise   for LISA,2019-06-06 07:11:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01575v5
211,"We examine the effects of dark energy dynamics and spatial curvature on cosmic reionization by studying reionization in tilted spatially-flat and untilted non-flat XCDM and $\phi$CDM dynamical dark energy inflation models that best fit the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and a large compilation of non-CMB data. We carry out a detailed statistical study, based on a principal component analysis and a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of a compilation of lower-redshift reionization data, to estimate the uncertainties in the cosmological model reionization histories. We find that, irrespective of the nature of dark energy, there are significant differences between the reionization histories of the spatially-flat and non-flat models. Although both the flat and non-flat models can accurately match the low-redshift ($z\lesssim6$) reionization observations, there is a clear discrepancy between high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter data and the predictions from non-flat models. This is solely due to the fact that the non-flat models have a significantly larger electron scattering optical depth, $\tau_{\rm el}$, compared to the flat models, which requires an extended and much earlier reionization scenario supported by more high-redshift ionizing sources in the non-flat models. Non-flat models also require strong redshift evolution in the photon escape fraction, that can become unrealistically high ($\gtrsim1$) at some redshifts. However, $\tau_{\rm el}$ is about 0.9-$\sigma$ lower in the tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model when the new Planck 2018 data are used and this reduction will partially alleviate the tension between the non-flat model predictions and the data.","Sourav Mitra, Chan-Gyung Park, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Bharat Ratra","12 pages, MNRAS, accepted",1901.09927v2,No journal ref found,Bharat Ratra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09927v2,2019-01-28 19:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph|hep-th,First study of reionization in tilted flat and untilted non-flat   dynamical dark energy inflation models,2019-06-06 04:09:56+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09927v2

We statistically validate EPIC 246865365b by calculating a false positive probability rate of 0.01%.

213,"With the increasing number of observed magnetic white dwarfs (WDs), the role of magnetic field of the WD in both single and binary evolutions should draw more attentions. In this study, we investigate the WD/main-sequence star binary evolution with the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA code), by considering WDs with non-, intermediate and high magnetic field strength. We mainly focus on how the strong magnetic field of the WD (in a polar-like system) affects the binary evolution towards type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The accreted matter goes along the magnetic field lines and falls down onto polar caps, and it can be confined by the strong magnetic field of the WD, so that the enhanced isotropic pole-mass transfer rate can let the WD grow in mass even with a low mass donor with the low Roche-lobe overflow mass transfer rate. The results under the magnetic confinement model show that both initial parameter space for SNe Ia and characteristics of the donors after SNe Ia are quite distinguishable from those found in pervious SNe Ia progenitor models. The predicted natures of the donors are compatible with the non-detection of a companion in several SN remnants and nearby SNe.","Iminhaji Ablimit, Keiichi Maeda",Published in ApJ,1902.02036v2,No journal ref found,Keiichi Maeda,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02036v2,2019-02-06 06:07:05+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Evolution of Magnetized White Dwarf Binaries to Type Ia Supernovae,2019-06-06 01:54:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02036v2

We present SOFIA far-IR spectrometer FIFI-LS observations of CO-rich knots in Cas A which cover a ~1 square arc minute area of the northern shell, in the [O III] 52 and 88 micron and [O I] 63 micron lines. The FIFI-LS spectra reveal that the line profiles of [O III] and [O I] are similar to those of the Herschel PACS [O III] and CO lines. We find that the [O III] maps show very different morphology than the [O I] map. The [O III] maps reveal diffuse, large-scale structures and the ratio of the two [O III] lines imply the presence of gas with a range of density 500 - 10,000 per cm^3 within the mapped region. In contrast, the [O I] map shows bright emission associated with the dense CO-rich knots. The 63 micron [O I] line traces cooled, dense post-shocked gas of ejecta.

215,"Large-scale convective flows called giant cells were once thought to transport the Sun's luminosity in the solar convection zone, but recent observations have called their existence into question. In place of large-scale flows, some authors have suggested the solar luminosity may instead be transported by small droplets of rapidly falling, low entropy fluid. This ""entropy rain"" could propagate as dense vortex rings, analogous to rising buoyant thermals in the Earth's atmosphere. In this work, we develop an analytical theory describing the evolution of dense, negatively buoyant thermals. We verify the theory with 2D and 3D simulations of laminar, axisymmetric thermals in highly stratified atmospheres. Our results show that dense thermals fall in two categories: a stalling regime in which the droplets slow down and expand, and a falling regime in which the droplets accelerate and shrink as they propagate downwards. We estimate that solar downflows are in the falling regime and maintain their entropy perturbation against diffusion until they reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that entropy rain may be an effective nonlocal mechanism for transporting the solar luminosity.","Evan H. Anders, Daniel Lecoanet, Benjamin P.

216,"Morphological classification is a key piece of information to define samples of galaxies aiming to study the large-scale structure of the universe. In essence, the challenge is to build up a robust methodology to perform a reliable morphological estimate from galaxy images. Here, we investigate how to substantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by mimicking human classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. We propose two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one based on non-parametric morphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another based on Deep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine learning methodology, we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel non-parametric approach to study galaxy morphology. The main datasets employed comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7). We also discuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of each model is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic validation with astrophysical parameters is also provided for Decision Tree models to assess the quality of our morphological classification. In all of our samples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5% OA to classify galaxies in two classes (elliptical and spiral). We compare our classification with state-of-the-art morphological classification from literature. Considering only two classes separation, we achieve 99% of overall accuracy in average when using our deep learning models, and 82% when using three classes.

The mass profile shape is quantified by the sparsity, the ratio of M500 to M2500, the masses at density contrast 500 and 2500, respectively. We study the correlations between the various parameters and their dependence on redshift. We confirm that SZ-selected samples, thought to reflect most closely the underlying cluster population, are dominated by disturbed and non-cool core objects at all z. There is no significant evolution or mass dependence of either the cool core fraction or the centroid shift parameter. The M parameter evolves slightly with z, having a correlation coefficient of rho= -0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 and a null hypothesis p-value of 0.01. In the high mass regime considered here, the sparsity evolves minimally with redshift, increasing by 10% between z<0.2 and z>0.55, an effect significant at less than 2 sigma. In contrast, the dependence of the sparsity on dynamical state is much stronger, increasing by a factor of $\sim$60% from the 1/3 most relaxed to the 1/3 most disturbed objects, an effect significant at more than 3 sigma. This is the first observational evidence that the shape of the integrated total mass profile in massive clusters is principally governed by the dynamical state, and is only mildly dependent on redshift. We discuss the consequences for the comparison between observations and theoretical predictions.","I. Bartalucci, M. Arnaud, G. W. Pratt, J. Démoclès, L.

218,"We study the propagation and dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a set of numerical models that each include a solar--like stratified atmosphere and a magnetic field with a null point. All simulations have the same magnetic field configuration but different transition region heights. Compressive wave packets introduced in the photospheric portion of the simulations refract towards the null and collapse it into a current sheet, which then undergoes reconnection. The collapsed null forms a current sheet due to a strong magnetic pressure gradient caused by the inability of magnetic perturbations to cross the null. Although the null current sheet undergoes multiple reconnection episodes due to repeated reflections off the lower boundary, we find no evidence of oscillatory reconnection arising from the dynamics of the null itself. Wave mode conversion around the null generates a series of slow mode shocks localized near each separatrix. The shock strength is asymmetric across each separatrix, and subsequent shock damping therefore creates a tangential discontinuity across each separatrix, with long--lived current densities. A parameter study of the injected wave energy to reach the null confirms our previous WKB estimates. Finally, using current estimates of the photospheric acoustic power, we estimate that the shock and Ohmic heating we describe may account for $\approx1-10\%$ of the radiative losses from coronal bright points with similar topologies, and are similarly insufficient to account for losses from larger structures such as ephemeral regions. At the same time, the dynamics are comparable to proposed mechanisms for generating type--II spicules.","Lucas A. Tarr, Mark Linton","24 pages, 20 figures.

The measured beam size, aperture efficiency, and main-beam efficiency are derived for the range of observing frequencies (66--116 GHz) within the 3mm atmospheric window. The telescope performs well even at the highest frequencies (>100 GHz). The amount of power in the error pattern of the antenna beam is estimated. Approximately 95% of the total antenna power is contained within 1 degree of the pointed direction. The calibration derived using small sources follows theoretical expectations based on the Ruze equation.

These ratios are similar to those observed in local (U)LIRGs, possibly indicating similarities in their interstellar medium. At the extremes, we find individual sub-millimetre galaxies with L$_{[C II]}$ /L$_{[N II]}$ low enough to suggest a large contribution from ionized gas to the [C II] flux and high enough to suggest strongly photon or X-ray region dominated flux.

221,"We examine the relationship between a number of long gamma-ray burst (lGRB) properties (isotropic emitted energy, luminosity, intrinsic duration, jet opening angle) and redshift. We find that even when accounting for conservative detector flux limits, there appears to be a significant correlation between isotropic equivalent energy and redshift, suggesting cosmological evolution of the lGRB progenitor. Analyzing a sub-sample of lGRBs with jet opening angle estimates, we find the beaming-corrected lGRB emitted energy does not correlate with redshift, but jet opening angle does. Additionally, we find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the intrinsic prompt duration and redshift, even when accounting for potential selection effects. We also find that - for a given redshift - isotropic energy is positively correlated with intrinsic prompt duration. None of these GRB properties appear to be correlated with galactic offset. From our selection-effect-corrected redshift distribution, we estimate a co-moving rate density for lGRBs, and compare this to the global cosmic star formation rate (SFR). We find the lGRB rate mildly exceeds the global star formation rate between a redshift of 3 and 5, and declines rapidly at redshifts above this (although we cannot constrain the lGRB rate above a redshift of about 6 due to sample incompleteness). We find the lGRB rate diverges significantly from the SFR at lower redshifts. We discuss both the correlations and lGRB rate density in terms of various lGRB progenitor models and their apparent preference for low-metallicity environments.","Nicole M.

In the case of a zero-pressure gas the solution exhibits hydrodynamic similarity and is universal: it is a lattice of integrable density singularities coinciding with maxima of the gravitational potential. With finite pressure effects included, there exists critical matter density that separates two regimes of behavior. If the average density is below the critical, the solution is a density wave which is in phase with the wave of the gravitational potential. If the average density is above the critical, the waves of the density and potential are out of phase. Traveling plane gravitostatic waves are also predicted and their properties elucidated.

223,"The dark matter halo sparsity provides a direct observational proxy of the halo mass profile, characterizing halos in terms of the ratio of masses within radii which enclose two different overdensities. Previous numerical simulation analyses have shown that at a given redshift the halo sparsity carries cosmological information encoded in the halo mass profile. Moreover, its ensemble averaged value can be inferred from prior knowledge of the halo mass function at the overdensities of interest. Here, we present a detailed study of the ensemble average properties of the halo sparsity. In particular, using halo catalogs from high-resolution N-body simulations, we show that its ensemble average value can be estimated from the ratio of the averages of the inverse halo masses as well as the ratio of the averages of the halo masses at the overdensity of interests. This can be relevant for galaxy clusters data analyses. As an example, we have estimated the average sparsity properties of galaxy clusters from the LoCuSS and HIFLUGCS datasets respectively. The results suggest that the expected consistency of the different average sparsity estimates can provide a test of the robustness of mass measurements in galaxy cluster samples.","Pier Stefano Corasaniti, Yann Rasera","11 pages, 6 figures.

224,"We report on a detailed analysis of the radio emission during the different modes of the pulsar J0826+2637 (B0823+26), observed using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 306-339 MHz observing frequencies. The pulsar profile has a postcursor and interpulse emission in addition to the main pulse. The single pulses showed the presence of nulling, periodic fluctuation in the emission as well as two prominent modes. In addition the pulsar also showed the presence of a null state where no emission was seen for roughly an hour which was immediately followed by a short duration ($\sim$5 minutes) bright state termed the Q-bright state. The nulling varied significantly in the two modes, from a few percent nulls in B-mode to more than 90 percent nulling during the Q-mode. Additionally, the pulsar showed the presence of low level emission in both the interpulse and postcursor components when the main pulse nulled in B-mode. We detected periodic fluctuations in both the main pulse and postcursor during B-mode which were most likely a form of periodic amplitude modulation unrelated to subpulse drifting. We have also detected the appearance of periodicity during the transitions from the null to the burst states in the Q-mode, which was longer than the B-mode modulations. Our analysis further revealed a significant increase in the main pulse and post-cursor intensity during the transition from the Q-mode to the short duration Q-bright mode. On the other hand no commensurate variation was visible in the interpulse intensity.","Rahul Basu, Dipanjan Mitra","14 pages, 13 figures, 6 Tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1906.02255v1,No journal ref found,Dipanjan Mitra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02255v1,2019-06-05 19:03:53+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Radio emission features in different modes of PSR J0826+2637 (B0823+26),2019-06-05 19:03:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02255v1
225,"Cassini/UVIS FUV observations of stellar occultations at Titan are well suited for probing its atmospheric composition and structure. However, due to instrument pointing motion, only five out of tens of observations have been analyzed. We present an innovative retrieval method that corrects for the effect of pointing motion by forward modeling the Cassini/UVIS instrument response function with the pointing motion value obtained from the SPICE C-kernel along the spectral dimension. To illustrate the methodology, an occultation observation made during flyby T52 is analyzed, when the Cassini spacecraft had insufficient attitude control. A high-resolution stellar model and an instrument response simulator that includes the position of the point source on the detector are used for the analysis of the pointing motion. The Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method is used to retrieve the line-of-sight abundance profiles of eleven species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, C6H6, HCN, C2N2, HC3N, C6N2 and haze particles) in the spectral vector fitting process. We obtain tight constraints on all of the species aside from C2H6, C2N2 and C6N2, for which we only retrieved upper limits. This is the first time that the T52 occultation was used to derive abundances of major hydrocarbon and nitrile species in Titan's upper and middle atmosphere, as pointing motion prohibited prior analysis. With this new method, nearly all of the occultations obtained over the entire Cassini mission could yield reliable profiles of atmospheric composition, allowing exploration of Titan's upper atmosphere over seasons, latitudes, and longitudes.","Siteng Fan, Donald E.

226,"In some Seyfert Galaxies, the hard X-rays that produce fluorescent emission lines are thought to be generated in a hot corona that is compact and located at only a few gravitational radii above the supermassive black hole. We consider the possibility that this X-ray source may be powered by small scale magnetic flux tubes attached to the accretion disk near the black hole. We use three dimensional, time dependent force-free simulations in a simplified setting to study the dynamics of such flux tubes as they get continuously twisted by the central compact star/black hole. We find that, the dynamical evolution of the flux tubes connecting the central compact object and the accretion disk is strongly influenced by the confinement of the surrounding field. Although differential rotation between the central object and the disk tends to inflate the flux tubes, strong confinement from surrounding field quenches the formation of a jet-like outflow, as the inflated flux tube becomes kink unstable and dissipates most of the extracted rotational energy relatively close to the central object. Such a process may be able to heat up the plasma and produce strong X-ray emission. We estimate the energy dissipation rate and discuss its astrophysical implications.","Yajie Yuan, Anatoly Spitkovsky, Roger D. Blandford, Dan R. Wilkins","16 pages, 17 figures.

This is far higher than is accessible at man-made accelerators, where the highest energy neutrino beam reached only 500 GeV.

228,"The main science driver for the coming generation of cosmological surveys is understanding dark energy which relies on testing General Relativity on the largest scales. Once we move beyond the simplest explanation for dark energy of a cosmological constant, the space of possible theories becomes both vast and extremely hard to compute realistic observables. A key discriminator of a cosmological constant, however, is that the growth of structure is scale-invariant on large scales. By carefully weighting observables derived from distributions of numbers of galaxies and a dipole pattern in their apparent sizes, we construct a null test which vanishes for any model of gravity or dark energy where the growth of structure is scale-independent. It relies only on very few assumptions about cosmology, and does not require any modelling of the growth of structure at late times. We show that with a survey like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument a scale-dependence of the order of 10-20 percent can be detected with 3 standard deviations with the null test, which will drop by a factor of 2 for a survey with a larger number of galaxies and volume, like the Square Kilometre Array will be capable of. We also show that the null test is very insensitive to typical uncertainties in other cosmological parameters including massive neutrinos and scale-dependent bias, making this a key null test for the cosmological constant.","Felipe Oliveira Franco, Camille Bonvin, Chris Clarkson","6 pages, 3 figures",1906.02217v1,No journal ref found,Chris Clarkson,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02217v1,2019-06-05 18:01:32+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,A null test to probe the scale-dependence of the growth of structure as   a test of General Relativity,2019-06-05 18:01:32+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02217v1

230,"The number and properties of observed gravitational microlensing events depend on the distribution and kinematics of stars and other compact objects along the line of sight. In particular, precise measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge enable strict tests of competing models of the Milky Way. Previous estimates, based on samples of up to a few hundred events, gave larger values than expected from the Galactic models and were difficult to reconcile with other constraints on the Galactic structure. Here, we used long-term photometric observations of the Galactic bulge by the OGLE survey to select a homogeneous sample of 8,000 gravitational microlensing events. We created the largest and the most accurate microlensing optical depth and event rate maps of the Galactic bulge. The new maps ease the tension between the previous measurements and Galactic models. They are consistent with some earlier calculations based on bright stars and are systematically 30% smaller than the other estimates based on ""all-source"" samples of microlensing events. The difference is caused by the careful estimation of the source star population. The new maps agree well with predictions based on the Besancon model of the Galaxy. Apart from testing the Milky Way models, our maps may have numerous other applications, such as the measurement of the initial mass function or constraining the dark matter content in the Milky Way center. The new maps will also inform planning of the future space-based microlensing experiments by revising the expected number of events.","P. Mroz, A. Udalski, J. Skowron, M. K. Szymanski, I.

231,"We perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis for a sample of 69 early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the CALIFA integral field spectroscopic survey, including 48 ellipticals and 21 S0's. We generate and quantitatively characterize profiles of light-weighted mean stellar age and metallicity within $\lesssim 2\text{R}_\text{eff}$, as a function of radius and stellar-mass surface density $\mu_*$. We study in detail the dependence of profiles on galaxies' global properties, including velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, stellar mass, morphology. ETGs are universally characterized by strong, negative metallicity gradients ($\sim -0.3\,\text{dex}$ per $\text{R}_\text{eff}$) within $1\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, which flatten out moving towards larger radii. A quasi-universal local $\mu_*$-metallicity relation emerges, which displays a residual systematic dependence on $\sigma_e$, whereby higher $\sigma_e$ implies higher metallicity at fixed $\mu_*$. Age profiles are typically U-shaped, with minimum around $0.4\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, asymptotic increase to maximum ages beyond $\sim 1.5\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, and an increase towards the centre. The depth of the minimum and the central increase anti-correlate with $\sigma_e$. We qualitatively interpret these observations in a two-phase scenario for the formation of ETGs. The region within $1\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$ mainly results from the competing effects of dissipative collapse, by which star formation proceeds outside-in and the negative metallicity gradient is established, and of AGN feedback, resulting in an inside-out quenching that is more effective for larger $\sigma_e$ (due to the black-hole mass vs. $\sigma$ relation). The flatter stellar population profiles in the outer regions likely result from the increasing contribution of accreted satellites, that are quenched and low-metallicity.","Stefano Zibetti, Anna R.

232,"We give a physical interpretation of the formalism intrinsic degeneracies of the gravitational lensing formalism that we derived on a mathematical basis in part IV of this series. We find that all degeneracies occur due to the partition of the mass density along the line of sight. Usually, it is partitioned into a background (cosmic) density and a foreground deflecting object. The latter can be further partitioned into a main deflecting object and perturbers. Weak deflecting objects along the line of sight are also added, either to the deflecting object or as a correction of the angular diameter distances, perturbing the cosmological background density. A priori, this is an arbitrary choice of reference frame and partition. They can be redefined without changing the lensing observables which are sensitive to the integrated deflecting mass density along the entire line of sight. Reformulating the time delay equation such that this interpretation of the degeneracies becomes easily visible, we note that the source can be eliminated from this formulation, which simplifies reconstructions of the deflecting mass distribution or the inference of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Subsequently, we list necessary conditions to break the formalism intrinsic degeneracies and discuss ways to break them by model choices or including non-lensing observables like velocity dispersions along the line of sight with their advantages and disadvantages. We conclude with a systematic summary of all formalism intrinsic degeneracies and possibilities to break them.",Jenny Wagner,"13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, comments very

A 95% confidence level limit for new physics is established at an event rate of 40 times the one expected from the standard model at this energy scale. The results presented here provide a new window to the low-energy neutrino physics, which allows one to explore for the first time the lowest energies accessible through the CE$\nu$NS with antineutrinos from nuclear reactors.","Alexis Aguilar-Arevalo, Xavier Bertou, Carla Bonifazi, Gustavo Cancelo, Alejandro Castañeda, Brenda Cervantes Vergara, Claudio Chavez, Juan C.

234,"We have modelled the near-infrared to radio images of the Crab Nebula with a Bayesian SED model to simultaneously fit its synchrotron, interstellar and supernova dust emission. We infer an interstellar dust extinction map with an average $A_{\text{V}}$=1.08$\pm$0.38 mag, consistent with a small contribution (<22%) to the Crab's overall infrared emission. The Crab's supernova dust mass is estimated to be between 0.032 and 0.049 M$_{\odot}$ (for amorphous carbon grains) with an average dust temperature $T_{\text{dust}}$=41$\pm$3K, corresponding to a dust condensation efficiency of 8-12%. This revised dust mass is up to an order of magnitude lower than some previous estimates, which can be attributed to our different interstellar dust corrections, lower SPIRE flux densities, and higher dust temperature than were used in previous studies. The dust within the Crab is predominantly found in dense filaments south of the pulsar, with an average V-band dust extinction of $A_{\text{V}}$=0.20-0.39 mag, consistent with recent optical dust extinction studies. The modelled synchrotron power-law spectrum is consistent with a radio spectral index $\alpha_{\text{radio}}$=0.297$\pm$0.009 and an infrared spectral index $\alpha_{\text{IR}}$=0.429$\pm$0.021. We have identified a millimetre excess emission in the Crab's central regions, and argue that it most likely results from two distinct populations of synchrotron emitting particles. We conclude that the Crab's efficient dust condensation (8-12%) provides further evidence for a scenario where supernovae can provide substantial contributions to the interstellar dust budgets in galaxies.","I.

235,"Five-dimensional braneworld constructions in anti-de Sitter space naturally lead to dark sector scenarios in which parts of the dark sector vanish at high 4d momentum or temperature. In the language of modified gravity, such feature implies a new mechanism for hiding light scalars, as well as the possibility of UV-completing chameleon-like effective theories. In the language of dark matter phenomenology, the high-energy behaviour of the mediator sector changes dark matter observational complementarity. A multitude of signatures---including exotic ones---are present from laboratory to cosmologic scales, including long-range forces with non-integer behaviour, periodic signals at colliders, `soft bombs' events well-known from conformal theories, as well as a dark phase transition and a typically small amount of dark radiation.","Philippe Brax, Sylvain Fichet, Philip Tanedo","6+12 pages, 3 figures",1906.02199v1,No journal ref found,Philip Tanedo,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02199v1,2019-06-05 18:00:00+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,The Warped Dark Sector,2019-06-05 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02199v1
236,"TESS has begun fulfilling its promise of delivering thousands of new transiting planets orbiting nearby bright stars. The mission's legacy will fuel exoplanet science for many years to come, but much of this science relies on precisely predicted transit times that are needed for many follow-up characterization studies. We investigate the severity of ephemeris deterioration for TESS planets, and find that most will have uncertainties greater than 1 hour just one year after their TESS observations. It is the mission's relatively short observing baseline that drives this fast deterioration. We identify the parameters that have the strongest impact on this deterioration. We recommend that one or two follow-up transits be observed three and/or nine months after the end of a planet's TESS observations, in order to refresh its ephemeris for two years past the follow-up observations. We find that the longer the baseline between the TESS and the follow-up observations, the longer the ephemerides will stay fresh, facilitating the scheduling of future observations with expensive facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, the ELTs, and Ariel.","Diana Dragomir, Mallory Harris, Joshua Pepper, Thomas Barclay, Steven Villanueva Jr","11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to AAS Journals",1906.02197v1,No journal ref found,Steven Villanueva Jr,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02197v1,2019-06-05 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Securing the legacy of TESS through the care and maintenance of TESS   planet ephemerides,2019-06-05 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02197v1
237,"Persistent excesses in the spectra of gamma rays from the galactic center and cosmic ray antiprotons can be explained by dark matter of mass 50-65 GeV annihilating into $b$ quarks, but this is typically hard to reconcile with direct detection constraints. We resolve this tension using a simple class of models, where dark matter is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, having naturally momentum-suppressed couplings to nuclei. Exploring the parameter space of the model, we find that it can explain the cosmic ray anomalies while remaining compatible with constraints from the relic abundance and annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In certain regions of parameter space, the Higgs-dark matter coupling can help stabilize the Higgs potential up to the Planck scale. The scalar partner of the dark matter is an extra Higgs boson, that can explain a tentative diphoton excess observed by CMS, and an excess of $b\bar{b}$ signal from LEP, if its mass is around 96 GeV and the model is extended to include a heavy scalar quark. This extended model predicts a monochromatic gamma-ray line near 64 GeV, at a level close to current experimental sensitivity, from dark matter annihilations in the galaxy.","James M.

238,"We model molecular outflows produced by the time dependent interaction between a stellar wind and a rotating cloud envelope in gravitational collapse, studied by Ulrich. We consider spherical and anisotropic stellar winds. We assume that the bipolar outflow is a thin shocked shell, with axial symmetry around the cloud rotation axis and obtain the mass and momentum fluxes into the shell. We solve numerically a set of partial differential equations in space and time, and obtain the shape of the shell, the mass surface density, the velocity field, and the angular momentum of the material in the shell. We find that there is a critical value of the ratio between the wind and the accretion flow momentum rates $\beta$ that allows the shell to expand. As expected, the elongation of the shells increase with the stellar wind anisotropy. In our models, the rotation velocity of the shell is the order to 0.1 - 0.2 km s$^{-1}$, a factor of 5-10 lower than the values measured in several sources. We compare our models with those of Wilkin and Stahler for early evolutionary times and find that our shells have the same sizes at the pole, although we use different boundary conditions at the equator.","J.

240,"Hilltop inflation models are often described by potentials $V = V_{0}(1-{\phi^{n}\over m^{n}}+...)$. The omitted terms indicated by ellipsis do not affect inflation for $m \lesssim 1$, but the most popular models with $n =2$ and $4$ for $m \lesssim 1$ are ruled out observationally. Meanwhile in the large $m$ limit the results of the calculations of the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ in the models with $V = V_{0}(1-{\phi^{n}\over m^{n}})$, for all $n$, converge to $r= 4/N \lesssim 0.07$, as in chaotic inflation with $V \sim \phi$, suggesting a reasonably good fit to the Planck data. We show, however, that this is an artifact related to the inconsistency of the model $V = V_{0}(1-{\phi^{n}\over m^{n}})$ at $\phi > m$. Consistent generalizations of this model in the large $m$ limit typically lead to a much greater value $r= 8/N$, which negatively affects the observational status of hilltop inflation. Similar results are valid for D-brane inflation with $V = V_{0}(1-{m^{n}\over \phi^{n}})$, but consistent generalizations of D-brane inflation models may successfully complement $\alpha$-attractors in describing most of the area in the ($n_{s}$, $r$) space favored by Planck 2018.","Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde","16pages, 8 figure",1906.02156v1,No journal ref found,Andrei Linde,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02156v1,2019-06-05 17:28:19+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph,On hilltop and brane inflation after Planck,2019-06-05 17:28:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02156v1

We lay out a critical observational path for the study of nearby debris disks that focuses on defining an empirical relationship between scattered light and thermal emission from a disk, probing the dynamics and properties of debris disks, and directly determining the influence of planets on disks.

242,"We show that a black hole surrounded by scalar dark matter develops scalar hair. This is the generalization of a phenomenon pointed out by Jacobson, that a minimally coupled scalar with a non-trivial time dependence far away from the black hole would endow the black hole with hair. In our case, the time dependence arises from the oscillation of a scalar field with a non-zero mass. We systematically explore the scalar profile around the black hole for different scalar masses. In the small mass limit, the scalar field has a $1/r$ component at large radius $r$, consistent with Jacobson's result. In the large mass limit (with the Compton wavelength of order of the horizon or smaller), the scalar field has a $1/r^{3/4}$ profile yielding a pile-up close to the horizon, while distinctive nodes occur for intermediate masses. Thus, the dark matter profile around a black hole, while challenging to measure, contains information about the dark matter particle mass. As an application, we consider the case of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, recently imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope. Its horizon size is roughly the Compton wavelength of a scalar particle of mass $10^{-20}$ eV. We consider the implications of the expected scalar pile-up close to the horizon, for fuzzy dark matter at a mass of $10^{-20}$ eV or below.","Lam Hui, Daniel Kabat, Xinyu Li, Luca Santoni, Sam S. C.

243,"We explore the general question of correlations among different waveband luminosities in a flux-limited multiband observational data set. Such correlations, often observed for astronomical sources, may either be intrinsic or induced by the redshift evolution of the luminosities and the data truncation due to the flux limits. We first address this question analytically. We then use simulated flux-limited data with three different known intrinsic luminosity correlations, and prescribed luminosity functions and evolution similar to the ones expected for quasars. We explore how the intrinsic nature of luminosity correlations can be deduced, including exploring the efficacy of partial correlation analysis with redshift binning in determining whether luminosity correlations are intrinsic and finding the form of the intrinsic correlation. By applying methods that we have developed in recent works, we show that we can recover the true cosmological evolution of the luminosity functions and the intrinsic correlations between the luminosities. Finally, we demonstrate the methods for determining intrinsic luminosity correlations on actual observed samples of quasars with mid-infrared, radio, and optical fluxes and redshifts, finding that the luminosity-luminosity correlation is significantly stronger between mid-infrared and optical than that between radio and optical luminosities, supporting the canonical jet-launching and heating model of active galaxies.","J.

245,"The Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) provided an unprecedented volume of precise astrometric and excellent photometric data. In terms of data mining the Gaia catalogue, machine learning methods have shown to be a powerful tool, for instance in the search for unknown stellar structures. Particularly, supervised and unsupervised learning methods combined together significantly improves the detection rate of open clusters. We systematically scan Gaia DR2 in a region covering the Galactic anticentre and the Perseus arm $(120 \leq l \leq 205$ and $-10 \leq b \leq 10)$, with the goal of finding any open clusters that may exist in this region, and fine tuning a previously proposed methodology successfully applied to TGAS data, adapting it to different density regions. Our methodology uses an unsupervised, density-based, clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, that identifies overdensities in the five-dimensional astrometric parameter space $(l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_{\delta})$ that may correspond to physical clusters. The overdensities are separated into physical clusters (open clusters) or random statistical clusters using an artificial neural network to recognise the isochrone pattern that open clusters show in a colour magnitude diagram. The method is able to recover more than 75% of the open clusters confirmed in the search area. Moreover, we detected 53 open clusters unknown previous to Gaia DR2, which represents an increase of more than 22% with respect to the already catalogued clusters in this region. We find that the census of nearby open clusters is not complete. Different machine learning methodologies for a blind search of open clusters are complementary to each other; no single method is able to detect 100% of the existing groups. Our methodology has shown to be a reliable tool for the automatic detection of open clusters, designed to be applied to the full Gaia DR2 catalogue.","A. Castro-Ginard, C. Jordi, X. Luri, T.

246,"The main outburst of the candidate black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH LMXB) MAXI J1535-571 ended in 2018 May and was followed by at least five episodes of re-brightenings. We have monitored this re-brightening phenomenon at X-ray and radio wavelengths using the {\it Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and Australia Telescope Compact Array, respectively. The first two re-brightenings exhibited a high peak X-ray luminosity (implying a high mass accretion rate) and were observed to transition from the hard to the soft state. However, unlike the main outburst, these re-brightenings did not exhibit clear hysteresis. During the re-brightenings, when MAXI J1535-571 was in the hard state, we observed the brightening of a compact radio jet which was subsequently quenched when the source transitioned to a similar soft state as was observed during the main outburst. We report on the first investigation of disk-jet coupling over multiple rapidly evolving re-brightenings in a BH LMXB. We find that the accretion flow properties and the accompanying compact jet evolve on a similarly rapid time scale of ~days rather than the typical value of ~weeks as observed for most other BH LMXBs during their main outburst events.","A.

Our search for the strongest linear correlation between S_K and i-band absolute magnitudes favors the common K ~ 0.5, though the range 0.3 - 0.8 is statistically acceptable.

The empirical phase shifts of neutron-neutron (nn), proton-proton (pp) and neutron-proton (np) interactions up to $k = 2$ ${\rm fm}^{-1}$ are described by multi-rank separable potentials.

250,"MAXI J1535$-$571 is a Galactic black hole candidate X-ray binary that was discovered going into outburst in 2017 September. In this paper, we present comprehensive radio monitoring of this system using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), as well as the MeerKAT radio observatory, showing the evolution of the radio jet during its outburst. Our radio observations show the early rise and subsequent quenching of the compact jet as the outburst brightened and then evolved towards the soft state. We constrain the compact jet quenching factor to be more than 3.5 orders of magnitude. We also detected and tracked (for 303 days) a discrete, relativistically-moving jet knot that was launched from the system. From the motion of the apparently superluminal knot, we constrain the jet inclination (at the time of ejection) and speed to $\leq 41^{\circ}$ and $\geq0.73$c, respectively. Extrapolating its motion back in time, our results suggest that the jet knot was ejected close in time to the transition from the hard intermediate state to soft intermediate state. The launching event also occurred contemporaneously with a short increase in X-ray count rate, a rapid drop in the strength of the X-ray variability, and a change in the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency that occurs $>$2.7 days before the first appearance of a possible type-B QPO.","T.

Aims: This paper aims to write explicit integrals of motion and distribution functions.   Methods: We propose an analytic formulation of the integrals of motion with an explicit dependence on potential. This formulation applies to potentials with rotational symmetry or triaxial symmetry. It is exact for St\""ackel potentials and approximate for other potentials.

253,"The g'r'i' colors of seven likely and potential contact binaries in the Kuiper belt were acquired with the Magellan-Baade telescope and combined with colors from the literature to understand contact binary surfaces. The likely and potential contact binaries discovered in the dynamically Cold Classical population display very-red/ultra-red colors. Such a color is common in this sub-population and infers that the Cold Classical contact binaries were formed in-situ. The likely contact binaries found in several mean motion resonances with Neptune have colors from moderately to ultra-red suggesting different formation regions. Among the nine contact binaries discovered in resonances, five have very-red/ultra-red colors and four have moderately-red surfaces. Based on the very-red/ultra-red colors and low to moderate inclination of the contact binaries in resonances, these contact binaries are maybe escaped dynamically Cold Classicals that are now trapped in resonances. Moderately-red surfaces are common in diverse sub-populations of the Kuiper belt and thus pinpointing their origin is difficult though they are most likely captured objects formed in the giant planet area. Finally, for the contact binary population we report an anti-correlation between inclination and g'-r', as noticed in the rest of this belt. We also have hints for trends between eccentricity, perihelion distance, rotational period and g'-r', but as we are still dealing with a limited sample, additional data are required to confirm them.","Audrey Thirouin, Scott S.

254,"We have advanced the energy and flux budget (EFB) turbulence closure theory that takes into account a two-way coupling between internal gravity waves (IGW) and the shear-free stably stratified turbulence. This theory is based on the budget equation for the total (kinetic plus potential) energy of IGW, the budget equations for the kinetic and potential energies of fluid turbulence, and turbulent fluxes of potential temperature for waves and fluid flow. The waves emitted at a certain level, propagate upward, and the losses of wave energy cause the production of turbulence energy. We demonstrate that due to the nonlinear effects more intensive waves produce more strong turbulence, and this, in turns, results in strong damping of IGW. As a result, the penetration length of more intensive waves is shorter than that of less intensive IGW. The anisotropy of the turbulence produced by less intensive IGW is stronger than that caused by more intensive waves. The low amplitude IGW produce turbulence consisting up to 90 \% of turbulent potential energy. This resembles the properties of the observed high altitude tropospheric strongly anisotropic (nearly two-dimensional) turbulence.","N. Kleeorin, I. Rogachevskii, I. A. Soustova, Yu. I.

255,"We emphasize that the completeness of the partition function, that is, the use of a converged partition function at the typical temperature range of the survey, is very important to decrease the uncertainty on this quantity and thus to derive reliable interstellar molecular densities. In that context, we show how the use of different approximations for the rovibrational partition function together with some interpolation and/or extrapolation procedures may affect the estimate of the interstellar molecular column density. For that purpose, we apply the partition function calculations to astronomical observations performed with the IRAM-30m telescope towards the NGC7538-IRS1 source of two N-bearing molecules: isocyanic acid (HNCO, a quasilinear molecule) and methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN, a symmetric top molecule). The case of methyl formate (HCOOCH$_3$), which is an asymmetric top O-bearing molecule containing an internal rotor is also discussed. Our analysis shows that the use of different partition function approximations leads to relative differences in the resulting column densities in the range 9 to 43\%. Thus, we expect this work to be relevant for surveys of sources with temperatures higher than 300~K and to observations in the infrared.","Miguel Carvajal, Cécile Favre, Isabelle Kleiner, Cecilia Ceccarelli, Edwin Bergin, Davide Fedele",Accepted for publication in A&A,1906.02067v1,No journal ref found,Davide Fedele,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02067v1,2019-06-05 15:11:57+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Impact of nonconvergence and various approximations of the partition   function on the molecular column densities in the interstellar medium,2019-06-05 15:11:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02067v1
256,"The wave-particle duality of light introduces two fundamental problems to imaging, namely, the diffraction limit and the photon shot noise. Quantum information theory can tackle them both in one holistic formalism: model the light as a quantum object, consider any quantum measurement, and pick the one that gives the best statistics. While Helstrom pioneered the theory half a century ago and first applied it to incoherent imaging, it was not until recently that the approach offered a genuine surprise on the age-old topic by predicting a new class of superior imaging methods. For the resolution of two sub-Rayleigh sources, the new methods have been shown theoretically and experimentally to outperform direct imaging and approach the true quantum limits. Recent efforts to generalize the theory for an arbitrary number of sources suggest that, despite the existence of harsh quantum limits, the quantum-inspired methods can still offer significant improvements over direct imaging for subdiffraction objects, potentially benefiting many applications in astronomy as well as fluorescence microscopy.",Mankei Tsang,"21 pages, 7 figures.

257,"Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, CH stars and barium stars, among other classes of chemically peculiar stars, are thought to be products of the interaction of low- and intermediate-mass binaries which occurred when the most evolved star was in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Binary evolution models predict that if the initial orbital periods of such systems are shorter than a few thousand days, their orbits should have circularised due to tidal effects. However, observations of the progeny of AGB binaries show that many of these objects have substantial eccentricities, up to about 0.9. In this work we explore the impact of wind mass transfer on the orbits of AGB binaries by performing numerical simulations in which the AGB wind is modelled using a hydrodynamical code and the stellar dynamics is evolved using an N-body code. We find that in most models wind mass transfer contributes to the circularisation of the orbit, but on longer timescales than tidal circularisation if the eccentricity is less than about 0.4. For low initial wind velocities and pseudo-synchronisation of the donor star, we find a structure resembling wind Roche-lobe overflow near periastron. In this case, the interaction between the gas and the stars is stronger than for high initial wind velocities and the orbit shrinks while the eccentricity decreases. In one of our models wind interaction is found to pump the eccentricity on a similar timescale as tidal circularisation. Although our study is based on a small sample of models, it offers some insight into the orbital evolution of eccentric binaries interacting via winds. A larger grid of numerical models for different binary parameters is needed to test if a regime exists where hydrodynamical eccentricity pumping can effectively counteract tidal circularisation, and if this can explain the puzzling eccentricities of the descendants of AGB binaries.","M.

258,"V348 Sgr is simultaneously an active hot R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variable, a peculiar extreme helium star, and the hydrogen-deficient central star of a planetary nebula. Explaining the RCB-type variability has been difficult since the star spends much of its time at minimum light. We present new ground-based multicolour photometry covering 5 observing seasons and 80 days of continuous photometry from space. The latter demonstrate small-amplitude (< 0.01 mag.) variability at maximum light on timescales typical for strange-mode pulsation in hot helium supergiants. These could provide a trigger for frequent dust-production episodes; other mechanisms must also be considered. Multi-colour photometry probes the reddening properties of extinction events from minimum to maximum light. The latter are comparable with extinction events due to carbonaceous grains seen in cooler RCB stars. Minimal reddening at minimum light is indicative that starlight scattered from circumstellar dust into the line of sight dominates transmitted light.","C.

259,"In this work, we characterise the contributions from both ongoing star formation and the ambient radiation field in Local Group galaxy M33, as well as estimate the scale of the local dust-energy balance (i.e. the scale at which the dust is re-emitting starlight generated in that same region) in this galaxy through high-resolution radiative transfer (RT) modelling, with defined stellar and dust geometries. We have characterised the spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33 from UV to sub-mm wavelengths, at a spatial scale of 100 pc. We constructed input maps of the various stellar and dust geometries for use in the RT modelling. By modifying our dust mix (fewer very small carbon grains and a lower silicate-to-carbon ratio as compared to the Milky Way), we can much better fit the sub-mm dust continuum. Using this new dust composition, we find that we are able to well reproduce the observed SED of M33 using our adopted model. In terms of stellar attenuation by dust, we find a reasonably strong, broad UV bump, as well as significant systematic differences in the amount of dust attenuation when compared to standard SED modelling. We also find discrepancies in the residuals of the spiral arms versus the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), indicating a difference in properties between these two regimes. The dust emission is dominated by heating due to the young stellar populations at all wavelengths ($\sim$80% at 10 $\mu$m to $\sim$50% at 1 mm). We find that the local dust-energy balance is restored at spatial scales greater than around 1.5 kpc.","Thomas G. Williams, Maarten Baes, Ilse De Looze, Monica Relaño, Matthew W. L.

260,"Measurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] can probe the minor merging history of a galaxy, providing a direct way to test the hierarchical assembly paradigm. While measurements of [$\alpha$/Fe] have been made in the stellar halo of the Milky Way, little is known about detailed chemical abundances in the stellar halo of M31. To make progress with existing telescopes, we apply spectral synthesis to low-resolution DEIMOS spectroscopy (R $\sim$ 2500 at 7000 Angstroms) across a wide spectral range (4500 Angstroms $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 9100 Angstroms). By applying our technique to low-resolution spectra of 170 giant stars in 5 MW globular clusters, we demonstrate that our technique reproduces previous measurements from higher resolution spectroscopy. Based on the intrinsic dispersion in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] of individual stars in our combined cluster sample, we estimate systematic uncertainties of $\sim$0.11 dex and $\sim$0.09 dex in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], respectively. We apply our method to deep, low-resolution spectra of 11 red giant branch stars in the smooth halo of M31, resulting in higher signal-to-noise per spectral resolution element compared to DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy, given the same exposure time and conditions. We find $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$ = 0.49 $\pm$ 0.29 dex and $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = 1.59 $\pm$ 0.56 dex for our sample. This implies that---much like the Milky Way---the smooth halo of M31 is likely composed of disrupted dwarf galaxies with truncated star formation histories that were accreted early in the halo's formation.","Ivanna Escala, Evan N.

261,"The direct detection of gravitational waves now provides a new channel of testing gravity theories. Despite that the parametrized post-Einsteinian framework is a powerful tool to quantitatively investigate effects of modification of gravity theory, the gravitational waveform in this framework is still extendable. One of such extensions is to take into account the gradual activation of dipole radiation due to massive fields, which are still only very weakly constrained if their mass $m$ is greater than $10^{-16}$ eV from pulsar observations. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, are sensitive to this activation in the mass range, $10^{-14}$ eV $\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-13}$ eV. Hence, we discuss a dedicated test for dipole radiation due to a massive field using the LIGO-Virgo collaboration's open data. In addition, assuming Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) type coupling, we combine the results of the analysis of the binary black hole events to obtain the 90\% CL constraints on the coupling parameter $\alpha_{\rm EdGB}$ as $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}} \lesssim 2.6$ km for any mass less than $6 \times 10^{-14}$ eV for the first time, including $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}} \lesssim 1.9$ km in the massless limit.","Kei Yamada, Tatsuya Narikawa, Takahiro Tanaka","10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables",1905.11859v2,No journal ref found,Takahiro Tanaka,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11859v2,2019-05-28 14:45:39+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Testing massive-field modifications of gravity via gravitational waves,2019-06-05 13:13:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11859v2
262,"Massive young stellar object (MYSOs) form during the collapse of high-mass pre-stellar cores, where infalling molecular material is accreted through a centrifugally-balanced accretion disc that is subject to efficient gravitational instabilities. In the resulting fragmented accretion disc of the MYSO, gaseous clumps and low-mass stellar companions can form, which will influence the future evolution of massive protostars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We perform dust continuum radiative transfer calculations and compute synthetic images of disc structures modelled by the gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of a forming MYSO, in order to investigate the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observability of circumstellar gaseous clumps and forming multiple systems. Both spiral arms and gaseous clumps located at ~a few 100 au from the protostar can be resolved by interferometric ALMA Cycle 7 C43-8 and C43-10 observations at band 6 (1.2 mm), using a maximal 0.015"" beam angular resolution and at least 10-30 min exposure time for sources at distances of 1-2 kpc. Our study shows that substructures are observable regardless of their viewing geometry or can be inferred in the case of an edge-viewed disc. The observation probability of the clumps increases with the gradually increasing efficiency of gravitational instability at work as the disc evolves. As a consequence, large discs around MYSOs close to the zero-age-main-sequence line exhibit more substructures than at the end of the gravitational collapse. Our results motivate further observational campaigns devoted to the close surroundings of the massive protostars S255IR-NIRS3 and NGC 6334I-MM1, whose recent outbursts are a probable signature of disc fragmentation and accretion variability.","D.

263,"In this work, we investigate the relation between the radially-resolved thermodynamic quantities of the intracluster medium in the X-COP cluster sample, aiming to assess the stratification properties of the ICM. We model the relations between radius, gas temperature, density and pressure using a combination of power-laws, also evaluating the intrinsic scatter in these relations. We show that the gas pressure is remarkably well correlated to the density, with very small scatter. Also, the temperature correlates with gas density with similar scatter. The slopes of these relations have values that show a clear transition from the inner cluster regions to the outskirts. This transition occurs at the radius $r_t = 0.19(\pm0.04)R_{500}$ and electron density $n_t = (1.91\pm0.21)\cdot10^{-3} cm^{-3} E^2 (z)$. We find that above 0.2 $R_{500}$ the radial thermodynamic profiles are accurately reproduced by a well defined and physically motivated framework, where the dark matter follows the NFW potential and the gas is represented by a polytropic equation of state. By modeling the gas temperature dependence upon both the gas density and radius, we propose a new method to reconstruct the hydrostatic mass profile based only on the quite inexpensive measurement of the gas density profile.","Vittorio Ghirardini, Stefano Ettori, Dominique Eckert, Silvano Molendi","9 pages, 8 figures, accepted by A&A",1906.00977v2,No journal ref found,Silvano Molendi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00977v2,2019-06-03 18:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,The polytropic state of the intracluster medium in the X-COP cluster   sample,2019-06-05 13:11:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00977v2
264,"Uncertainties in our knowledge of the properties of dense matter near and above nuclear saturation density are among the main sources of variations in multi-messenger signatures predicted for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We construct 97 new finite-temperature equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter that obey current experimental, observational, and theoretical constraints and discuss how systematic variations in the EOS parameters affect the properties of cold nonrotating NSs and the core collapse of a $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star. The core collapse of the $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star is simulated in spherical symmetry using the general-relativistic radiation-hydrodynamics code GR1D where neutrino interactions are computed for each EOS using the NuLib library. We conclude that the effective mass of nucleons at densities above nuclear saturation density is the largest source of uncertainty in the CCSN neutrino signal and dynamics even though it plays a subdominant role in most properties of cold NS matter. Meanwhile, changes in other observables affect the properties of cold NSs, while having little effect in CCSNe. To strengthen our conclusions, we perform six octant three-dimensional CCSN simulations varying the effective mass of nucleons at nuclear saturation density. We conclude that neutrino heating and, thus, the likelihood of explosion is significantly increased for EOSs where the effective mass of nucleons at nuclear saturation density is large.","A. S.

265,"The jet photosphere has been proposed as the origin for the gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. In many such models, characteristic features in the spectra appear below the energy range of the $\textit{Fermi}$ GBM detectors, so joint fits with X-ray data are important in order to assess the photospheric scenario. Here we consider a particular photospheric model which assumes localized subphotospheric dissipation by internal shocks in a non-magnetized outflow. We investigate it using Bayesian inference and a sample of 8 GRBs with known redshifts which are observed simultaneously with $\textit{Fermi}$ GBM and $\textit{Swift}$ XRT. This provides us with an energy range of $0.3$~keV to $40$~MeV and much tighter parameter constraints. We analyze 32 spectra and find that 16 are well described by the model. We also find that the estimates of the bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, and the fireball luminosity, $L_{0,52}$, decrease while the fraction of dissipated energy, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{d}}$, increase in the joint fits compared to GBM only fits. These changes are caused by a small excess of counts in the XRT data, relative to the model predictions from fits to GBM only data. The fact that our limited implementation of the physical scenario yields 50\% accepted spectra is promising, and we discuss possible model revisions in the light of the new data. Specifically, we argue that the inclusion of significant magnetization, as well as removing the assumption of internal shocks, will provide better fits at low energies.","Björn Ahlgren, Josefin Larsson, Vlasta Valan, Daniel Mortlock, Felix Ryde, Asaf Pe'er","20 pages, 11 figures",1906.02006v1,No journal ref found,Asaf Pe'er,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02006v1,2019-06-05 12:58:18+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Investigating subphotospheric dissipation in gamma-ray bursts using   joint Fermi-Swift observations,2019-06-05 12:58:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02006v1

These transverse oscillations are not connected to any external phenomena like flares or coronal mass ejections, and show significantly lower amplitudes than the externally excited decaying oscillations. Numerical studies have managed to reproduce such decayless oscillations in the form of footpoint driven standing waves in coronal loops, and to treat them as a possible mechanism for wave heating of the solar corona. Our aim is to investigate the correlation between the observed amplitudes of the oscillations and input the energy flux from different drivers. We perform 3D MHD simulations in single, straight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes for different drivers, in the presence of gravity. Synthetic images at different spectral lines are constructed with the use of the FoMo code. The development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability leads to mixing of plasma between the flux tube and the hot corona. Once the KHI is fully developed, the amplitudes of the decayless oscillations show only a weak correlation with the driver strength. We find that low amplitude decayless kink oscillations may correspond to significant energy fluxes of the order of the radiative losses for the Quiet Sun. A clear correlation between the input energy flux and the observed amplitudes from our synthetic imaging data cannot be established. Stronger drivers lead to higher vales of the line width estimated energy fluxes. Finally, estimations of the energy fluxes by spectroscopic data are affected by the LOS angle, favoring combined analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data for single oscillating loops.","K.

267,"We explored the occurrence rate of small close-in planets among $\textit{Kepler}$ target stars as a function of the iron abundance and the stellar total velocity $V_\mathrm{tot}$. We estimated the occurrence rate of those planets by combining information from LAMOST and the California-$\textit{Kepler}$ Survey (CKS) and found that iron-poor stars exhibit an increase in the occurrence with $V_\mathrm{tot}$ from $f < 0.2$ planets per star at $ V_\mathrm{tot} < 30\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$ to $f \sim 1.2$ at $V_\mathrm{tot} > 90\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$. We suggest this planetary profusion may be a result of a higher abundance of $\alpha$ elements associated with iron-poor, high-velocity stars. Furthermore, we have identified an increase in small planet occurrence with iron abundance, particularly for the slower stars ($V_\mathrm{tot} < 30\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$), where the occurrence increased to $f \sim 1.1$ planets per star in the iron-rich domain. Our results suggest there are two regions in the $([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}],[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}])$ plane in which stars tend to form and maintain small planets. We argue that analysis of the effect of overall metal content on planet occurrence is incomplete without including information on both iron and $\alpha$ element enhancement.","Dolev Bashi, Shay Zucker","8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1906.01982v1,No journal ref found,Shay Zucker,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01982v1,2019-06-05 12:34:31+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,"Small Planets in the Galactic Context: Host Star Kinematics, Iron, and   $α$ Element Enhancement",2019-06-05 12:34:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01982v1
268,"Obtaining a faithful source intensity distribution map of the sky from noisy data demands incorporating known information of the expected signal, especially when the signal is weak compared to the noise. We introduce a widely used procedure to incorporate these priors through a Bayesian regularisation scheme in the context of map-making of the anisotropic stochastic GW background (SGWB). Specifically, we implement the quadratic form of regularizing function with varying strength of regularization and study its effect on image restoration for different types of the injected source intensity distribution in simulated LIGO data. We find that regularization significantly enhances the quality of reconstruction, especially when the intensity of the source is weak, and dramatically improves the stability of deconvolution. We further study the quality of reconstruction as a function of regularization constant. While in principle this constant is dependent on the data set, we show that the deconvolution process is robust against the choice of the constant, as long as it is chosen from a broad range of values obtained by the method presented here.","Sambit Panda, Swetha Bhagwat, Jishnu Suresh, Sanjit Mitra","14 pages, 8 figures and 1 table",1905.08276v2,No journal ref found,Sanjit Mitra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08276v2,2019-05-20 18:05:58+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.IM,Stochastic gravitational wave background mapmaking using regularised   deconvolution,2019-06-05 12:30:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08276v2
269,"The umbral oscillations of velocity are commonly observed in the chromosphere of a sunspot. Their sources are considered to be either the external p-mode driving or the internal excitation by magnetoconvection. Even though the possibility of the p-mode driving has been often considered, the internal excitation has been rarely investigated. We report the identification of the oscillation patterns that may be closely related to the events of internal excitation from the observations of velocity oscillations in the temperature minimum region of two sunspots. The velocities were determined from the spectral data of the Fe I 5435 A line, a magnetically insensitive line, taken with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph of the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. As a result, we identified 4 oscillation patterns of 2.0 * 10^3 km coherent size that were clearly identified for about 7.9 minutes with oscillation amplitude of 9.3 * 10^-2 km/s. The power of the oscillations in these centers was concentrated in the 3 minute band. All the oscillation centers were located above the umbral dots undergoing noticeable morphological and dynamical changes that may be regarded as an observable signature of small-scale magnetoconvection inside the umbrae. Our results support the notion that magnetoconvection associated with umbral dots inside sunspots can drive the 3 minute umbral oscillations.","Kyuhyoun Cho, Jongchul Chae, Eun-kyung Lim, Heesu Yang",Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal,1906.01971v1,No journal ref found,Heesu Yang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01971v1,2019-06-05 12:25:39+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,The Observational Evidence for the Internal Excitation of Sunspot   Oscillations Inferred from the Fe I 5435 A Line,2019-06-05 12:25:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01971v1
270,"Young stars exhibit variability due to changes in the gas accretion rate onto them, an effect that should be quite significant in the early stages of their formation. As protostars are embedded within their natal cloud, this variability may only be inferred through long wavelength observations. We perform radiative transfer simulations of young stellar objects (YSOs) formed in hydrodynamical simulations, varying the structure and luminosity properties in order to estimate the long-wavelength, sub-mm and mm, variations of their flux. We find that the flux increase due to an outburst event depends on the protostellar structure and is more prominent at sub-mm wavelengths than at mm wavelengths; e.g. a factor of 40 increase in the luminosity of the young protostar leads to a flux increase of a factor of 10 at 250 micron but only a factor of 2.5 at 1.3 mm. We find that the interstellar radiation field dilutes the flux increase but that this effect may be avoided if resolution permits the monitoring of the inner regions of a YSO, where the heating is primarily due to protostellar radiation. We also confirm that the bolometric temperature and luminosity of outbursting protostars may result in an incorrect classification of their evolutionary stage.","Benjamin MacFarlane, Dimitris Stamatellos, Doug Johnstone, Gregory Herczeg, Giseon Baek, Huei-Ru Vivien Chen, Sung-Ju Kang, Jeong-Eun Lee","MNRAS accepted, 8 pages, 9 figures",1906.01966v1,No journal ref found,Jeong-Eun Lee,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01966v1,2019-06-05 12:15:02+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.GA,Observational signatures of outbursting protostars -- II: Exploring a   wide range of eruptive protostars,2019-06-05 12:15:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01966v1
271,"Context: The interstellar medium (ISM) on all scales is full of structures that can be used as tracers of processes that feed turbulence. Aims: We used HI survey data to derive global properties of the angular power distribution of the local ISM. Methods: HI4PI observations on an nside = 1024 HEALPix grid and Gaussian components representing three phases, the cold, warm, and unstable lukewarm neutral medium (CNM, WNM, and LNM), were used for velocities $|v_{\mathrm{LSR}}| \leq 25$ \kms. For high latitudes $|b| > 20\deg$ we generated apodized maps. After beam deconvolution we fitted angular power spectra. Results: Power spectra for observed column densities are exceptionally well defined and straight in log-log presentation with 3D power law indices $\gamma \geq -3$ for the local gas. For intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs) we derive $\gamma = -2.6$ and for high velocity clouds (HVCs) $\gamma = -2.0$. Single-phase power distributions for the CNM, LNM, and WNM are highly correlated and shallow with $ \gamma \sim -2.5$ for multipoles $l \leq 100$. Excess power from cold filamentary structures is observed at larger multipoles. The steepest single-channel power spectra for the CNM are found at velocities with large CNM and low WNM phase fractions. Conclusions: The phase space distribution in the local ISM is configured by phase transitions and needs to be described with three distinct different phases, being highly correlated but having distributions with different properties. Phase transitions cause locally hierarchical structures in phase space. The CNM is structured on small scales and is restricted in position-velocity space. The LNM as an interface to the WNM envelops the CNM. It extends to larger scales than the CNM and covers a wider range of velocities. Correlations between the phases are self-similar in velocity.","P. M. W. Kalberla, U. Haud","23 pages, 33 figures, A&A in press",1905.08583v2,No journal ref found,U.

272,"Accretion onto protostars may occur in sharp bursts. Accretion bursts during the embedded phase of young protostars are probably most intense, but can only be inferred indirectly through long-wavelength observations. We perform radiative transfer calculations for young stellar objects (YSOs) formed in hydrodynamic simulations to predict the long wavelength, sub-mm and mm, flux responses to episodic accretion events, taking into account heating from the young protostar and from the interstellar radiation field. We find that the flux increase due to episodic accretion events is more prominent at sub-mm wavelengths than at mm wavelengths; e.g. a factor of ~570 increase in the luminosity of the young protostar leads to a flux increase of a factor of 47 at 250 micron but only a factor of 10 at 1.3 mm. Heating from the interstellar radiation field may reduce further the flux increase observed at longer wavelengths. We find that during FU Ori-type outbursts the bolometric temperature and luminosity may incorrectly classify a source as a more evolved YSO, due to a larger fraction of the radiation of the object being emitted at shorter wavelengths","Benjamin MacFarlane, Dimitris Stamatellos, Doug Johnstone, Gregory Herczeg, Giseon Baek, Huei-Ru Vivien Chen, Sung-Ju Kang, Jeong-Eun Lee","MNRAS accepted, 12 pages, 9 figures",1906.01960v1,No journal ref found,Jeong-Eun Lee,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01960v1,2019-06-05 12:01:44+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Observational signatures of outbursting protostars - I: From   hydrodynamic simulations to observations,2019-06-05 12:01:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01960v1
273,"The production of the neutron-capture isotopes beyond iron that we observe today in the solar system is the result of the combined contribution of the r-process, the s- process and possibly the i-process. Low-mass AGB (2 < M/Msun < 3) and massive (M >10 Msun ) stars have been identified as the sites of the s-process. In this work we consider the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low-mass AGB stars. We provide an update of the NuGrid Set models, adopting the same general physics assumptions but using an updated convective-boundary mixing model accounting for the contribution from internal gravity waves. The combined data set includes the initial masses Mzams/Msun = 2, 3 for Z = 0.03, 0.02, 0.01. These models are computed with the MESA stellar code and the evolution is followed up to the end of the AGB phase. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes in post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. The convective boundary mixing model leads to the formation of a 13C-pocket three times wider compared to the one obtained in the previous set of models, bringing the simulation results now in closer agreement with observations. We also discuss the potential impact of other processes inducing mixing, like rotation, adopting parametric models compatible with theory and observations.

274,"Context. Since the discovery of the first Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 in 1998, the family of these sources kept growing on. Currently, it counts 22 members. All AMXPs are transients with usually very long quiescence periods, implying that mass accretion rate in these systems is quite low and not constant. Moreover, for at least three sources, a non-conservative evolution was also proposed.   Aims. Our purpose is to study the long term averaged mass-accretion rates in all the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars discovered so far, to investigate a non-conservative mass-transfer scenario.   Methods. We calculated the expected mass-transfer rate under the hypothesis of a conservative evolution based on their orbital periods and on the (minimum) mass of the secondary (as derived from the mass function), driven by gravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking. Using this theoretical mass-transfer, we determined the expected accretion luminosity of the systems. Thus, we achieved the lower limit to the distance of the sources by comparing the computed theoretical luminosity and the observed flux averaged over a time period of 20 years. Then, the lower limit to the distance of the sources has been compared to the value of the distance reported in literature to evaluate how reasonable is the hypothesis of a conservative mass-transfer.   Results. Based on a sample of 18 sources, we found strong evidences of a non-conservative mass-transfer for five sources, for which the estimated distance lower limits are higher than their known distances. We also report hints for mass outflows in other six sources. The discrepancy can be fixed under the hypothesis of a non-conservative mass-transfer in which a fraction of the mass transferred onto the compact object is swept away from the system, likely due to the (rotating magnetic dipole) radiation pressure of the pulsar.","A.

277,"We compute the evolution of interstellar dust in a hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated disc galaxy. We newly implement the evolution of full grain size distribution by sampling 32 grid points on the axis of the grain radius. We solve it consistently with the chemical enrichment and hydrodynamic evolution of the galaxy. This enables us to theoretically investigate spatially resolved evolution of grain size distribution in a galaxy. The grain size distribution evolves from a large-grain-dominated ($\gtrsim 0.1~\mu$m) phase to a small-grain production phase, eventually converging to a power-law-like grain size distribution similar to the so-called MRN distribution. We find that the small-grain abundance is higher in the dense ISM in the early epoch ($t\lesssim 1$ Gyr) because of efficient dust growth by accretion, while coagulation makes the small-grain abundance less enhanced in the dense ISM later. This leads to steeper extinction curves in the dense ISM than in the diffuse ISM in the early phase, while they show the opposite trend later. The radial trend is also described by faster evolution in the inner part. We also confirm that the simulation reproduces the observed trend in the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, and in the radial gradients of dust-to-gas ratio and dust-to-metal ratio. Since the above change in the grain size distribution occurs at $t\sim 1$ Gyr, the age and density dependence of grain size distribution has a significant impact on the extinction curves even at high redshift.","Shohei Aoyama, Hiroyuki Hirashita, Kentaro Nagamine","Submitted to MNRAS, 14 pages, 7 figures",1906.01917v1,No journal ref found,Kentaro Nagamine,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01917v1,2019-06-05 10:11:26+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.SR,Galaxy simulation with the evolution of grain size distribution,2019-06-05 10:11:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01917v1

We also consider the intermediate case where a test particle moves in the field generated by $N$ non-interacting particles, which in turn move in a static smooth potential. We investigate the dependence on $N$ and on the softening length of the largest Lyapunov exponent both of single particle orbits and of the full $N$-body system. For single orbits we also study the dependence on the angular momentum and on the energy. Our results confirm the expectation that orbital properties of single orbits in finite-$N$ systems approach those of orbits in smooth potentials in the continuum limit $N \to \infty$ and that the largest Lyapunov exponent of the full $N$-body system does decrease with $N$, for sufficiently large systems. However, single orbits in frozen models and active self-consistent models have different largest Lyapunov exponents and the $N$-dependence of the values in non-trivial, so that the use of frozen $N$-body potentials to gain information on large-$N$ systems or on the continuum limit may be misleading in certain cases.","Pierfrancesco Di Cintio, Lapo Casetti","13 pages 16 figures.

It is important to understand how a star's magnetic axis moves with respect to the spin axis in the star's early life, as this effects both electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of viscous dissipation within the star in this process. We advance this program by additionally considering the effect of the electromagnetic torque. We find an interesting interplay between the viscous dissipation, which makes the magnetic axis orthogonalise with respect to the spin, verses magnetic torques that tend to make the magnetic axis align with the spin axis.

On the other hand, overall velocity profiles of stellar and ionized gas components of EVCC 516 show no signature of significant rotation. The occurrence of a KDC and zero rotation in the internal kinematics along with the central star formation support the scenario of gas-rich dwarf-dwarf mergers in the formation of these two dE(bc)s. Furthermore, evolution of dE(bc)s in a cluster environment into ordinary dEs with KDCs is possible based on their structural properties. We suggest that at least some of the dE(bc)s in the Virgo cluster were formed through dwarf-dwarf mergers in lower density environments before they subsequently fell into the cluster; they were then quenched by subsequent effects within the cluster environment.","Jiwon Chung, Soo-Chang Rey, Eon-Chang Sung, Suk Kim, Youngdae Lee, Woong Lee","Accepted for publication in ApJ, 21 pages, 6 figures, and 2 Tables",1906.01902v1,No journal ref found,Woong Lee,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01902v1,2019-06-05 09:21:55+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Formation of Blue-cored Dwarf Early-type Galaxies in a Cluster   Environment: a Kinematical Perspective,2019-06-05 09:21:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01902v1
282,"We derive dust masses ($M_{\rm dust}$) from the spectral energy distributions of 58 post-starburst galaxies (PSBs). There is an anticorrelation between specific dust mass ($M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\star}$) and the time elapsed since the starburst ended, indicating that dust was either destroyed, expelled, or rendered undetectable over the $\sim$1 Gyr after the burst. The $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\star}$ depletion timescale, 205$^{+58}_{-37}$ Myr, is consistent with that of the CO-traced $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$, suggesting that dust and gas are altered via the same process. Extrapolating these trends leads to the $M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$ values of early-type galaxies (ETGs) within 1-2 Gyr, a timescale consistent with the evolution of other PSB properties into ETGs. Comparing $M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}$ for PSBs yields a calibration, log $M_{\rm H_2}$ = 0.45 log $M_{\rm dust}$ + 6.02, that allows us to place 33 PSBs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane, $\Sigma \rm SFR-\Sigma M_{\rm H_2}$. Over the first $\sim$200-300 Myr, the PSBs evolve down and off of the KS relation, as their star formation rate (SFR) decreases more rapidly than $M_{\rm H_2}$. Afterwards, $M_{\rm H_2}$ continues to decline whereas the SFR levels off. These trends suggest that the star-formation efficiency bottoms out at 10$^{-11}\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and will rise to ETG levels within 0.5-1.1 Gyr afterwards. The SFR decline after the burst is likely due to the absence of gas denser than the CO-traced H$_2$. The mechanism of the $M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and$M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$ decline, whose timescale suggests active galactic nucleus (AGN) or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) feedback, may also be preventing the large CO-traced molecular gas reservoirs from collapsing and forming denser star forming clouds.","Zhihui Li, K.

283,"During solar flares, a large fraction of the released magnetic energy is carried by energetic electrons that transfer and deposit energy in the Sun's atmosphere. Electron transport is often approximated by a cold thick-target model (CTTM), assuming that electron energy is much larger than the temperature of the ambient plasma, and electron energy evolution is modeled as a systematic loss. Using kinetic modeling of electrons, we re-evaluate the transport and deposition of flare energy. Using a full collisional warm-target model (WTM), we account for electron thermalization and for the properties of the ambient coronal plasma such as its number density, temperature and spatial extent. We show that the deposition of non-thermal electron energy in the lower atmosphere is highly dependent on the properties of the flaring coronal plasma. In general, thermalization and a reduced WTM energy loss rate leads to an increase of non-thermal energy transferred to the chromosphere, and the deposition of non-thermal energy at greater depths. The simulations show that energy is deposited in the lower atmosphere initially by high energy non-thermal electrons, and later by lower energy non-thermal electrons that partially or fully thermalize in the corona, over timescales of seconds, unaccounted for in previous studies. This delayed heating may act as a diagnostic of both the injected non-thermal electron distribution and the coronal plasma, vital for constraining flare energetics.","Natasha L. S. Jeffrey, Eduard P.

284,"We report on observations of flare ribbon kernels during the 2012 August 31 filament eruption. In the 1600\,\AA{} and 304\,\AA{} channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, flare kernels were observed to move along flare ribbons at velocities $v_\parallel$ of up to $450$ km\,s$^{-1}$. Kernel velocities were found to be roughly anti-correlated with strength of the magnetic field. Apparent slipping motion of flare loops was observed in the 131\,\AA{} only for the slowest kernels moving through strong-$B$ region. In order to interpret the observed relation between $B_{\text{LOS}}$ and $v_\parallel$, we examined distribution of the norm $N$, a quantity closely related to the slippage velocity. We then calculated the norm $N$ of the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) in MHD model of a solar eruption adapted to the magnetic environment which qualitatively agrees to that of the observed event. We found that both the modelled $N$ and velocities of kernels reach their highest values in the same weak-field regions, one located in the curved part of the ribbon hook and the other in the straight part of the conjugate ribbon located close to a parasitic polarity. Oppositely, lower values of the kernel velocities are seen at the tip of the ribbon hook, where the modelled $N$ is low. Since the modelled distribution of $N$ matches the observed dynamics of kernels, this supports that the kernel motions can be interpreted as a signature of QSL reconnection during the eruption.","Juraj Lörinčík, Guillaume Aulanier, Jaroslav Dudík, Alena Zemanová, Elena Dzifčáková",No comment found,1906.01880v1,No journal ref found,Elena Dzifčáková,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01880v1,2019-06-05 08:36:43+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Velocities of flare kernels and the mapping norm of field line   connectivity,2019-06-05 08:36:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01880v1
285,"We present the discovery of a unique object, a chemically peculiar Ap-type star showing $\delta$ Scuti pulsations which is bound in an eclipsing binary system with an orbital period shorter than 3 days. HD 99458 is, therefore, a complex astrophysical laboratory opening doors for studying various, often contradictory, physical phenomena at the same time. It is the first Ap star ever discovered in an eclipsing binary. The orbital period of 2.722 days is the second shortest among all known chemically peculiar (CP2) binary stars. Pulsations of $\delta$ Scuti type are also extremely rare among CP2 stars and no unambiguously proven candidate has been reported. HD 99458 was formerly thought to be a star hosting an exoplanet, but we definitely reject this hypothesis by using photometric observations from the K2 mission and new radial velocity measurements. The companion is a low-mass red dwarf star ($M_{2}=0.45(2)$ M$_{\odot}$) on an inclined orbit ($i=73.2(6)$ degrees) that shows only grazing eclipses. The rotation and orbital periods are synchronized, while the rotation and orbital axes are misaligned. HD 99458 is an interesting system deserving of more intense investigations.","M. Skarka, P.

286,"We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics with all modifications redefined within the constitutive relations between the D,H,B and E fields. This allows the interpretation of the axion induced background bound charge, polarization current and background polarization and magnetization satisfying the charge-current continuity equation. This representation is of similar form to photon sector odd-parity Lorentz invariance violating background fields. We show that when a DC B-field is applied an oscillating background polarization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. In contrast, when DC E-field is applied, an oscillating background magnetization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. We show that these terms are equivalent to impressed source terms, analogous to the way that voltage and current sources are impressed into Maxwell's equations in circuit and antenna theory. The impressed source terms represent the conversion of external energy into electromagnetic energy, and in the case of axion modified electrodynamics this is due to the inverse Primakoff effect converting energy from axions into photons. The axion induced oscillating polarization under a DC magnetic field is analogous to a permanent polarised electret oscillating at the axion Compton frequency, which sources an electromotive force from an effective impressed magnetic current source. In particular, it is shown that the impressed electrical DC current that drives the solenoidal magnetic DC field of an electromagnet, induces an impressed magnetic current parallel to the DC electrical current, oscillating at the Compton frequency of the axion. We show that the magnetic current drives a voltage source through an electric vector potential and also defines the boundary condition of the oscillating axion induced polarization inside and outside the electromagnet.","Michael Edmund Tobar, Ben T.

287,"The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will investigate the origins of cosmic acceleration using weak gravitational lensing at near infrared wavelengths. Lensing analyses place strict constraints on the precision of size and ellipticity measurements of the point spread function. WFIRST will use hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector arrays, which must be fully characterized to inform data reduction and calibration procedures such that unbiased cosmological results can be achieved. Hirata & Choi 2019 introduces formalism to connect the cross-correlation signal of different flat field time samples to non-linear detector behaviors such as the brighter fatter effect (BFE) and non-linear inter-pixel capacitance (NL-IPC), and this paper applies that framework to a WFIRST development detector, SCA 18237. We find a residual correlation signal after accounting for classical non-linearity. This residual correlation contains a combination of the BFE and NL-IPC; however, further tests suggest that the BFE is the dominant mechanism. If interpreted as a pure BFE, it suggests that the effective area of a pixel is increased by $(2.87\pm0.03)\times 10^{-7}$ (stat.) for every electron in the 4 nearest neighbors, with a rapid $\sim r^{-5.6\pm0.2}$ fall-off of the effect for more distant neighbors. We show that the IPC inferred from hot pixels contains the same large-scale spatial variations as the IPC inferred from auto-correlations, albeit with an overall offset of $\sim 0.06\%$. The NL-IPC inferred from hot pixels is too small to explain the cross-correlation measurement, further supporting the BFE hypothesis. This work presents the first evidence for the BFE in an H4RG-10 detector, demonstrates some of the useful insights that can be gleaned from flat field statistics, and represents a significant step towards calibration of WFIRST data.","Ami Choi, Christopher M.

288,"Weak gravitational lensing studies aim to measure small distortions in the shapes of distant galaxies, and thus place very tight demands on the understanding of detector-induced systematic effects in astronomical images. The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will carry out weak lensing measurements in the near infrared using the new Teledyne H4RG-10 detector arrays, which makes the range of possible detector systematics very different from traditional weak lensing measurements using optical CCDs. One of the non-linear detector effects observed in CCDs is the brighter-fatter effect (BFE), in which charge already accumulated in a pixel alters the electric field geometry and causes new charge to be deflected away from brighter pixels. Here we describe the formalism for measuring the BFE using flat field correlation functions in infrared detector arrays. The auto-correlation of CCD flat fields is often used to measure the BFE, but because the infrared detector arrays are read out with the charge ""in place,"" the flat field correlations are dominated by capacitive cross-talk between neighboring pixels (the inter-pixel capacitance, or IPC). We show that because the infrared detector arrays can be read out non-destructively, one can compute numerous cross-correlation functions between different time slices of the same flat exposures, and that correlations due to IPC and BFE leave distinct imprints. We generate a suite of simulated flat fields and show that the underlying IPC and BFE parameters can be extracted, even when both are present in the simulation. There are some biases in the BFE coefficients up to 12%, which are likely caused by higher order terms that are dropped from this analysis. The method is applied to laboratory data in the companion Paper II.","Christopher M.

289,"Signatures of X-ray reprocessing (reflection) out of an accretion disk are commonly observed in the high-energy spectrum of accreting black holes, and can be used to probe the strong gravity region around these objects. In this paper, we extend previous work in the literature and we employ the first full emission model for relativistic reflection in non-Kerr spacetime to demonstrate an approach that tests the Kerr black hole hypothesis. We analyze a composite spectrum obtained with the proportional counter array in the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), of the stellar-mass black hole GX 339-4 in its brightest hard state. With a remarkable sensitivity of $\sim$0.1% and 40 million counts in the 3-45 keV band to capture the faint features in the reflection spectrum, we demonstrate that it is possible with existing data and an adequate model to place constraints on the black hole spin $a_*$ and the deformation parameter that quantifies the departure from the Kerr metric. Our measurement obtained with the best fit model, which should be regarded as principally a proof of concept, is $a_*=0.92^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and $\alpha_{13}=-0.76^{+0.78}_{-0.60}$ with a 90% confidence level and is consistent with the hypothesis that the compact object in GX 339-4 is a Kerr black hole. We also discuss how the physical model choice and the emissivity profile adopted could make an impact on the constraints of $\alpha_{13}$ and spin. To enable Kerr metric test using X-ray reflection spectroscopy, it is essential to improve our astrophysical understanding of the black hole system, e.g., the natures of accretion flow and corona.","Jingyi Wang, Askar B.

291,"Beam-driven instabilities are considered in a pulsar plasma assuming that both the background plasma and the beam are relativistic J\""uttner distributions. In the rest frame of the background, the only waves that can satisfy the resonance condition are in a tiny range of slightly subluminal phase speeds. The growth rate for the kinetic (or maser) version of the weak-beam instability is much smaller than has been estimated for a relativistically streaming Gaussian distribution, and the reasons for this are discussed. The growth rate for the reactive version of the weak-beam instability is treated in a conventional way. We compare the results with exact calculations, and find that the approximate solutions are not consistent with the exact results. We conclude that, for plausible parameters, there is no reactive version of the instability. The growth rate in the pulsar frame is smaller than that in the rest frame of the background plasma by a factor $2\gamma_{\rm s}$, where $\gamma_{\rm s} = 10^2 {\rm -} 10^3$ is the Lorentz factor of the bulk motion of the background plasma, placing a further constraint on effective wave growth.

292,"We present the revised and high quality CCD time series observations in 2017 and 2018 of the W UMa-type contact binary BH~Cas. The combination of our new determinations of minimum times and those collected from the literatures reveal a long-term period increase with a rate of $\textit{dP/dt}\,=\,+3.27 \times 10^{-7} \textrm{d}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, which can be accounted for by angular momentum transfer as the less-massive component loses its mass to the more massive one. One cyclical oscillation ($A'=0.00300$~days and $P'=20.09$~yrs) superimposed on the long-term period increase tendency is attributed to one additional object that orbits BH Cas. The low-resolution spectra of this source are observed at phase $\sim$0.0 and $\sim$0.5 in 2018 and 2019, and the spectral types are identified as K3V$\,\pm\,$1 and G8V$\,\pm\,$2. According to the luminosity contributions and spectra at these phases, the spectral type of the primary star is close to K3V$\,\pm\,$1. We infer a cool spot on the hotter and less-massive component to fit the asymmetry of light curves. In addition, changes in the location, temperature, and area of spots on the secondary star in different observations may indicate that the magnetic field activity of the secondary is more active than that of the primary. Such strong spot activities and optical flare are both detected at the same time from a W UMa-type star for the first time.

293,"The broadband afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A is believed to be from an off-axis structured jet. The central engine of a gamma-ray burst usually launches a pair of outflows that move oppositely, it is reasonable to consider the emission from a double-sided structured jets, with a near-jet moving toward us and a counter-jet moving away from us. Assuming that the two branches of the jet have the same physical parameters, we have calculated their radio emission. It is found that the counter-jet component will emerge in the radio light curves $\sim$ 2500 days post-merger.It typically leads to a plateau in the light curve, thus could be hopefully revealed by high accuracy radio observations. We have also considered the possibilities that both branches have different parameters, and found that if some of the physical parameters of the counter-jet are evaluated more favorably than those of the near-jet, then the counter-jet emission will be enhanced and will clearly show up as an obvious plateau or even a rebrightening. For example, when the circum-burst medium encountered by the counter-jet is assumed to be 100 times denser than that of the near-jet, a remarkable radio plateau will appear at $\sim$ 600 days. However, in X-ray bands, the counter-jet component is generally too faint to be discerned. It is argued that the late radio observations of GW170817/GRB 170817A can help determine the key parameters and diagnose the environment of the event.","Long-Biao Li, Jin-Jun Geng, Yong-Feng Huang, Bing Li","7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

294,"Observations of galaxies and primordial radiation suggest that the Universe is made mostly of non-luminous dark matter. Several types of new fundamental particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) but no definitive signal has been seen despite concerted efforts by many collaborations. One exception is the much-debated claim by the DAMA collaboration of a statistically significant annual modulation in the event rate of their experiment with a period and phase consistent with that expected from WIMP dark matter. Several groups have been working to develop experiments with the aim of reproducing DAMA's results using the same target medium. Here we report results from the initial operation of the COSINE-100 experiment. COSINE-100 uses sodium iodide as the target medium-the same medium as DAMA-and is designed to carry out a model-independent test of DAMA's claim. Initial data based on the first 59.5 days indicate that there is no excess of events over the expected background, confirming that DAMA's annual modulation signal is in severe tension with results from other experiments under the assumption of dark matter having spin independent interactions and the Standard Halo Model. COSINE-100 is now taking data to study the presence of dark matter-induced annual modulation in the event rate of the sodium iodide detectors.","Govinda Adhikari, Pushparaj Adhikari, Estella Barbosa de Souza, Nelson Carlin, Seonho Choi, Mitra Djamal, Anthony C.

295,"We studied large-scale magnetic field reversals of a galaxy based on a magnetic vector map of NGC6946. The magnetic vector map was constructed based on the polarization maps in the C and X bands after the determination of the geometrical orientation of a disk with the use of an infrared image and the velocity field, according to the trailing spiral arm assumption. We examined the azimuthal variation of the magnetic vector and found that the magnetic pitch angle changes continually as a function of the azimuthal angle in the inter-arm region. However, the direction of the magnetic field had $180^\circ$ jumps at the azimuthal angles of $20^\circ, 110^\circ, 140^\circ, 220^\circ, 280^\circ$, and $330^\circ$. These reversals seem to be related to the spiral arms since the locations of the jumps are coincident with those of the spiral arms.

296,"Small-scale ephemeral coronal holes may be a recurring feature on the solar disk, but have received comparatively little attention. These events are characterized by compact structure and short total lifetimes, substantially less than a solar disk crossing. We present a systematic search for these events, using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly EUV image data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, covering the time period 2010 - 2015. Following strict criteria, this search yielded four clear examples of the ephemeral coronal hole phenomenon. The properties of each event are characterized, including their total lifetime, growth and decay rates, and areas. The magnetic properties of these events are also determined using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager data. Based on these four events, ephemeral coronal holes experience rapid initial growth of up to 3000 Mm2/hr, while the decay phases are typically more gradual. Like conventional coronal holes, the mean magnetic field in each ephemeral coronal hole displays a consistent polarity, with mean magnetic flux densities generally < 10 G. No evidence of a corresponding signature is seen in solar wind data at 1 AU. Further study is needed to determine whether ephemeral coronal holes are under-reported events or a truly rare phenomenon.","Andrew R. Inglis, Rachel E. O'Connor, W. Dean Pesnell, Michael S.

297,"We present the evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) properties of the globular cluster (GC) populations and their host galaxies formed in the E-MOSAICS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We compute the luminosities of all clusters associated with 25 simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies, discussed in previous works, in the rest-frame UV and optical bands by combining instantaneous cluster properties (age, mass, metallicity) with simple stellar population models, from redshifts $z=0$ to 10. Due to the rapid fading of young stellar populations in the UV, most of the simulated galaxies do not host GCs bright enough to be individually identified in deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, even in highly magnified systems. The median age of the most UV-luminous GCs is $<10$ Myr (assuming no extinction), increasing to $\gtrsim 100$ Myr for red optical filters. We estimate that these GCs typically only contribute a few per cent of the total UV luminosity of their host galaxies at any epoch. We predict that the number density of UV-bright proto-GCs (or cluster clumps) will peak between redshifts $z=1-3$. In the main progenitors of Milky Way-mass galaxies, $10$-$20$ per cent of the galaxies at redshifts $1 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$ have clusters brighter than $M_{\rm UV} < -15$, and less than $10$ per cent at other epochs. The brightest cluster in the galaxy sample at $z>2$ is typically $M_{\rm UV} \sim -16$, consistent with the luminosities of observed compact, high-redshift sources.","Joel Pfeffer, Nate Bastian, Robert A.

298,"If the dark matter is composed of virialized particles with mass $\lesssim 10$ eV, it is well described as a classical bosonic field. This field is stochastic in nature, where the field oscillation amplitude fluctuates following a Rayleigh distribution. Most experimental searches have been in the regime $\gtrsim\mu$eV, where it is reasonable to assume a fixed field oscillation amplitude determined by the average local dark matter energy density. However, several direct-detection experiments are searching in the ultra-light mass regime where the dark matter field coherence time greatly exceeds the measurement time and the field oscillation amplitude is uncertain. We show that the corresponding laboratory constraints of bosonic dark matter field couplings to standard model particles are overestimated by as much as an order of magnitude.","Gary P.

299,"Using high-resolution numerical simulations we investigate the plasma heating driven by periodic two-fluid acoustic waves that originate at the bottom of the photosphere and propagate into the gravitationally stratified and partially ionized solar atmosphere. We consider ions+electrons and neutrals as separate fluids that interact between themselves via collision forces. The latter play an important role in the chromosphere, leading to significant damping of short-period waves. Long-period waves do not essentially alter the photospheric temperatures, but they exhibit the capability of depositing a part of their energy in the chromosphere. This results in up about a five times increase of ion temperature that takes place there on a time-scale of a few minutes. The most effective heating corresponds to waveperiods within the range of about 30-200 s with a peak value located at 80 s. However, we conclude that for the amplitude of the driver chosen to be equal to 0.1 km s$^{-1}$, this heating is too low to balance the radiative losses in the chromosphere.","B. Kuźma, D. Wójcik, K.

301,"Observations reveal the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBH) as early as ~700 million years after the Big Bang. Their formation path is still subject to current debate. We explore the influence of magnetic fields, which are strongly amplified via the turbulent small-scale dynamo, on the formation of SMBH seeds within the direct collapse scenario. In this study, we perform for the first time cosmological magnetohydrodynamic large eddy simulations that employ a model for unresolved, compressible MHD turbulence. In total we perform 36 simulations for 9 haloes each with two different initial magnetic field strengths, and with and without employing the unresolved turbulence model. We make use of the adaptive mesh refinement approach to achieve an effective spatial resolution of less than one proper astronomical unit. We consider a regime where cooling is regulated by atomic hydrogen and the molecular hydrogen gets dissociated by a strong radiation field. Our main finding is that the majority of the gas properties in the haloes at the final output are predominantly determined by the run-away gravitational collapse. Turbulence is supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic in all cases, and magnetic fields are amplified to an approximately dynamically relevant regime. Finally, fragmentation during the collapse is intermittent and mass accretion rates range from 0.2-3 Msun/yr. This suggests that the presence of strongly amplified magnetic fields and turbulence provides additional pressure support on small scales and make the direct collapse a viable scenario for the formation of massive objects under the required ambient conditions.","Philipp Grete, Muhammad A.

Moreover, we review current results from global oscillation analyses that include the constraints set by running reactor and atmospheric neutrino experiments. They permit to set tighter bounds on the active-sterile oscillation parameters but as yet are not able to provide a definite conclusion on the existence of eV-scale sterile neutrinos.","Sebastian Böser, Christian Buck, Carlo Giunti, Julien Lesgourgues, Livia Ludhova, Susanne Mertens, Anne Schukraft, Michael Wurm","80 pages, 35 figures, submitted to PPNP",1906.01739v1,No journal ref found,Michael Wurm,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01739v1,2019-06-04 21:56:40+00:00,hep-ex,hep-ex|astro-ph.CO|hep-ph|physics.ins-det,Status of Light Sterile Neutrino Searches,2019-06-04 21:56:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01739v1
303,"KOI-3278 is a self-lensing stellar binary consisting of a white-dwarf secondary orbiting a Sun-like primary star. Kruse and Agol (2014) noticed small periodic brightenings every 88.18 days in the Kepler photometry and interpreted these as the result of microlensing by a white dwarf with about 63$\%$ of the mass of the Sun. We obtained two sets of spectra for the primary that allowed us to derive three sets of spectroscopic estimates for its effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity for the first time. We used these values to update the Kruse and Agol (2014) Einsteinian microlensing model, resulting in a revised mass for the white dwarf of $0.539^{+0.022}_{-0.020} \, M_{\odot}$. The spectra also allowed us to determine radial velocities and derive orbital solutions, with good agreement between the two independent data sets. An independent Newtonian dynamical MCMC model of the combined velocities yielded a mass for the white dwarf of $0.5122^{+0.0057}_{-0.0058} \, M_{\odot}$. The nominal uncertainty for the Newtonian mass is about four times better than for the Einsteinian, $\pm 1.1\%$ vs. $\pm 4.1\%$ and the difference between the two mass determinations is $5.2 \%$. We then present a joint Einsteinian microlensing and Newtonian radial velocity model for KOI-3278, which yielded a mass for the white dwarf of $0.5250^{+0.0082}_{-0.0089} \, M_{\odot}$. This joint model does not rely on any white dwarf evolutionary models or assumptions on the white dwarf mass-radius relation. We discuss the benefits of a joint model of self-lensing binaries, and how future studies of these systems can provide insight into the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs.","Daniel A.

304,"We present the ALMA observations of CO isotopes and 1.3 mm continuum emission toward the N159E-Papillon Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The spatial resolution is 0.""25-0.""28 (0.06-0.07 pc), which is a factor of 3 higher than the previous ALMA observations in this region. The high resolution allowed us to resolve highly filamentary CO distributions with typical width of $\sim$0.1 pc (full width half maximum) and line mass of a few $\times$ 100 $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$. The filaments (more than ten in number) show outstanding hub-filament structure emanating from the Nebular center toward the north. We identified for the first time two massive protostellar outflows of $\sim$10$^4$ yr dynamical age along one of the most massive filaments. The observations also revealed several pillar-like CO features around the Nebula. The H II region and the pillars show complementary spatial distribution and the column density of the pillars is an order of magnitude higher than that of the pillars in the Eagle nebula (M16) in the Galaxy, suggesting an early stage of pillar formation with an age younger than $\sim$10$^5$ yrs. We suggest that a cloud-cloud collision triggered the formation of the filaments and protostar within the last $\sim$2 Myr. It is possible that the collision is more recent since part of the kpc-scale H I flows come from the tidal interaction resulting from the close encounter between the LMC and SMC $\sim$200 Myr ago as suggested for R136 by Fukui et al.

305,"We derive new constraints on the non-gravitational baryon-dark-matter scattering (BDMS) by evaluating the mass thresholds of dark matter (DM) haloes in which primordial gas can cool efficiently to form Population III (Pop III) stars, based on the timing of the observed 21-cm absorption signal. We focus on the BDMS model with interaction cross-section $\sigma=\sigma_{1}[v/(1\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}})]^{-4}$, where $v$ is the relative velocity of the encounter. Our results rule out the region in parameter space with $\sigma_{1}\gtrsim 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{cm^{2}}$ and DM particle mass $m_{\chi}c^{2}\lesssim 3\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{GeV}$, where the cosmic number density of Pop III hosts at redshift $z\sim 20$ is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than in the standard Lambda cold DM ($\Lambda$CDM) case. In these BDMS models, the formation of Pop III stars is significantly suppressed for $z\gtrsim 20$, inconsistent with the timing of the observed global 21-cm absorption signal. For the fiducial BDMS model with $m_{\chi}c^{2}=0.3$ GeV and $\sigma_{1}=8\times 10^{-20}\ \mathrm{cm^{2}}$, capable of accommodating the measured absorption depth, the number density of Pop III hosts is reduced by a factor of $3-10$ at $z\sim 15-20$, when the 21-cm signal is imprinted, compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The confluence of future detailed cosmological simulations with improved 21-cm observations promises to probe the particle-physics nature of DM at the small-scale frontier of early structure formation.","Boyuan Liu, Anna T.

306,"The first interstellar object, `Oumuamua, was discovered in the Solar System by Pan-STARRS in 2017, allowing for a calibration of the abundance of interstellar objects of its size $\sim 100\;$ m. One would expect a much higher abundance of smaller interstellar objects, with some of them colliding with Earth frequently enough to be noticeable. Based on the CNEOS catalog of bolide events, we identify the $\sim 0.45$m meteor detected at 2014-01-08 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999\% confidence. We infer that the meteor had an asymptotic speed of $v_{\infty} \sim 42.1 \pm 5.5\; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1}}$ outside of the solar system. Its origin is approximately towards R.A. $49.4 \pm 4.1^{\circ}$ and declination $11.2 \pm 1.8^{\circ}$, implying that its initial velocity vector was $58\pm6\; \mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$ away from the velocity of the Local Standard of Rest (LSR). Its high LSR speed implies a possible origin from the deep interior of a planetary system or a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy. The local number density of its population is $10^{6{^{+0.75}_{-1.5}}} \; \mathrm{AU^{-3}}$ or $9 \times 10^{21{^{+0.75}_{-1.5}}} \; \mathrm{pc^{-3}}$ (necessitating 0.2 - 20 Earth masses of material to be ejected per local star).

307,"We present a novel infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling methodology that uses likelihood-based weighting of the model fitting results to construct probabilistic H-R diagrams (pHRD) for X-ray identified, intermediate-mass (2-8 $M_{\odot}$), pre-main sequence young stellar populations. This methodology is designed specifically for application to young stellar populations suffering strong, differential extinction ($\Delta A_V > 10$ mag), typical of Galactic massive star-forming regions. We pilot this technique in the Carina Nebula Complex (CNC) by modeling the 1-8 $\mu$m SEDs of 2269 likely stellar members that exhibit no excess emission from circumstellar dust disks at 4.5 $\mu$m or shorter wavelengths. A subset of ${\sim}100$ intermediate-mass stars in the lightly-obscured Trumpler 14 and 16 clusters have available spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$, measured from the Gaia-ESO survey. We correctly identify the stellar temperature in 70% of cases, and the aggregate pHRD for all sources returns the same peak in the stellar age distribution as obtained using the spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$. The SED model parameter distributions of stellar mass and evolutionary age reveal significant variation in the duration of star formation among four large-scale stellar overdensities within the CNC and a large distributed stellar population. Star formation began ${\sim}10$ Myr ago and continues to the present day, with the star formation rate peaking ${<}3$ Myr ago when the massive Trumpler 14 and 16 clusters formed.

While the main purpose of this paper is to release the catalogues, we also perform, as a proof of concept, a brief analysis of z > 6 objects selected using drop-out method, as well as spectroscopically confirmed sources and multiple images in both clusters. While dropout methods yield a sample of high-z galaxies, the addition of longer wavelength data reveals that as expected the samples have substantial contamination at the ~30-45% level by dusty galaxies at lower redshifts. Furthermore, we show that spectroscopic redshifts are still required to unambiguously determine redshifts of multiply imaged systems. Finally, the now publicly available ASTRODEEP catalogues were combined for all HFFs and used to explore stellar properties of a large sample of 20,000 galaxies across a large photometric redshift range.

We notice that the intracluster medium is heated as a result of the merger, and we find evidence for a merger shock in the region between both subcluster haloes. X-ray observations confirm that the shocks in these systems are among the hottest known in the literature. From the ICM analysis of temperature discontinuity, the Mach numbers were determined to be $M_{\rm G036}=1.3$ and $M_{\rm G292}=1.5$ for G036 and G292, respectively. In this paper, for each cluster, we propose a hydrodynamic model for the merger as a whole, compatible with their diffuse X-ray emission and temperature maps. The simulations suggest that both clusters are observed shortly before pericentric passage. Our simulation results indicate that the merger of the G036 system is seen at an inclination of 50$^{\circ}$ (the angle between the plane of the orbit and the plane of the sky), and merely 50 Myr prior to the pericentric passage.

These objects have very accurate abundances for many elements and are generally considered as standard candles, so that their galactocentric distances are very well determined. These stars are relatively young, with ages between the main types of photoionized nebulae, namely the younger HII regions and the older planetary nebulae. In this paper we consider the O/H and Fe/H gradients based on a large sample of galactic cepheids, and compare the results with recent determinations from photoionized nebulae.","W. J. Maciel, S.

312,The violent collisions of black holes provide for excellent test-beds of Einstein's general relativity in the strong/dynamical gravity regime. We here demonstrate the resolving power one can gain upon the use of multi-band observations of gravitational waves from both ground- and space-based detectors. We find significant improvement in both generic parameterized tests of general relativity and consistency tests of inspiral-merger-ringdown parts of the waveform over single-band detections. Such multi-band observations are crucial for unprecedented probes of e.g. parity-violation in gravity.,"Zack Carson, Kent Yagi","6 pages, 4 figures; IMR consistency test updates and additional

313,"Most aspects of stellar evolution proceed far too slowly to be directly observable in a single star on human timescales. The thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch is one exception. The combination of state-of-the-art modelling techniques with data assimilated from observations collected by amateur astronomers over many decades provide, for the first time, the opportunity to identify a star occupying precisely this evolutionary stage. In this study, we show that the rapid pulsation period change and associated reduction in radius in the bright, northern variable star T Ursae Minoris are caused by the recent onset of a thermal pulse. We demonstrate that T UMi transitioned into a double-mode pulsation state, and we exploit its asteroseismic features to constrain its fundamental stellar parameters. We use evolutionary models from MESA and linear pulsation models from GYRE to track simultaneously the structural and oscillatory evolution of models with varying mass. We apply a sophisticated iterative sampling scheme to achieve time resolution $\le10$ years at the onset of the relevant thermal pulses.   We report initial mass of $2.0\pm0.15\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and an age of $1.17 \pm 0.21$ Gyr for T UMi. This is the most precise mass and age determination for a single asymptotic giant branch star ever obtained. The ultimate test of our models will be the continued observation of its evolution in real time: we predict that the pulsation periods in T UMi will continue shortening for a few decades before they rebound and begin to lengthen again, as the star expands in radius.","László Molnár, Meridith Joyce, László Kiss","18 pages, 14 figures, plus 8 pages appendix. v1: submitted version,

314,"The calculation of the characteristic function of the signal fluctuations due to clustered astrophysical sources is performed in this paper. For the typical case of power-law differential number counts and two-point angular correlation function, we present an extension of Zolotarev's theorem that allows us to compute the cumulants of the logarithm of the absolute value of the intensity. As a test, simulations based on recent observations of radio galaxies are then carried out, showing that these cumulants can be very useful for determining the fundamental parameters defining the number counts and the correlation. If the angular correlation scale of the observed source population is known, the method presented here is able to obtain estimators of the amplitude and slope of the power-law number counts with mean absolute errors that are one order of magnitude better than previous techniques, that did not take into account the correlation. Even if the scale of correlation is not well known, the method is able to estimate it and still performs much better than if the effect of correlations is not considered.","Francisco Argüeso, Diego Herranz, Luigi Toffolatti, Joaquín González-Nuevo","16 pages, 2 figures.

In this work, after some introductory comments on nuclear forces, nuclear ab initio theory, and nuclear phenomenology, we employ two techniques, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and Density Functional Theory, to practically handle an extended system composed of strongly interacting neutrons. We start by summarizing work on the static response of neutron matter, which considers the impact of external influences on the time-independent system. We then proceed to discuss new results of the energy of quasiparticle excitations in neutron matter, including QMC calculations with chiral or phenomenological nucleon-nucleon interactions.

316,"If the early universe is dominated by an energy density which evolves other than radiation-like the normal Hubble-temperature relation $H\propto T^2$ is broken and dark matter relic density calculations in this era can be significantly different. We first highlight that for a population of states $\phi$ sourcing an initial expansion rate of the form $H\propto T^{2+n/2}$ for $n\geq-4$, during the period of appreciable $\phi$ decays the evolution transitions to $H\propto T^4$. The decays of $\phi$ imply a source of entropy production in the thermal bath which alters the Boltzmann equations and impacts the dark matter relic abundance. We show that the form of the initial expansion rate leaves a lasting imprint on relic densities established while $H\propto T^4$ since the value of the exponent $n$ changes the temperature evolution of the thermal bath. In particular, a dark matter relic density set via freeze-in or non-thermal production is highly sensitive to the temperature dependance of the initial expansion rate. This work generalises earlier studies which assumed initial expansion rates due to matter or kination domination.","Carlos Maldonado, James Unwin",v2. matches published version,1902.10746v2,No journal ref found,James Unwin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10746v2,2019-02-27 19:31:12+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Establishing the Dark Matter Relic Density in an Era of Particle Decays,2019-06-04 18:30:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10746v2
317,"NuRadioMC is a Monte Carlo framework designed to simulate ultra-high energy neutrino detectors that rely on the radio detection method. This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed. Comprehensive examples are used to discuss the capabilities of the code and different aspects of instrumental design decisions.","Christian Glaser, Daniel García-Fernández, Anna Nelles, Jaime Alvarez-Muñiz, Steven W.

Close to threshold, the production of nuclear bound states is preferred over the decay into individual nucleons, effectively decoupling antihelium and antiproton fluxes and allowing the former to dominate. $\phi$ can either form dark matter itself or be produced by it, and can give rise to a flux of antihelium that is large enough to explain the preliminary antihelium events reported by AMS-02.","Julian Heeck, Arvind Rajaraman",8 pages,1906.01667v1,No journal ref found,Arvind Rajaraman,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01667v1,2019-06-04 18:16:57+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,How to produce antihelium from dark matter,2019-06-04 18:16:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01667v1
319,"In this paper we study two newly discovered classes of radio sources: the highly energetic, short-lived events, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and a new category of compact sources known as Fanaroff-Riley type 0 radio galaxies (FR0s). Due to a possible catastrophic event origin for the FRBs and a previous correlation found with an FR0 in the gamma ray spectrum, it is possible that these radio sources could also emit high energy photons in the Fermi-LAT satellite energy range (20 MeV - 300GeV). Here we present an exhaustive time-dependent and spatial search of all up-to-date observed FRBs and FR0s, respectively. We perform a likelihood analysis of the radio sources by modeling the excess flux of gamma rays with a varying index power law function using data from Fermi-LAT and the 4FGL catalog. Sources with test statistic greater than 16 (corresponding to about 4{\sigma}) were further analyzed including 2 FRBs and 7 FR0s.

320,"We implement a detailed dust model into the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model which includes: injection of dust by type II and type Ia supernovae (SNe) and AGB stars; grain growth in molecular clouds; and destruction due to supernova-induced shocks, star formation, and reheating. Our grain growth model follows the dust content in molecular clouds and the inter-cloud medium separately, and allows growth only on pre-existing dust grains. At early times, this can make a significant difference to the dust growth rate. Above $z\sim8$, type II SNe are the primary source of dust, whereas below $z\sim8$, grain growth in molecular clouds dominates. However, the detailed history of galaxy formation is important for determining the dust content of any individual galaxy. We introduce a fit to the dust-to-metal (DTM) ratio as a function of metallicity and age, which can be used to deduce the DTM ratio of galaxies at any redshift. At $z\lesssim3$, we find a fairly flat mean relation between metallicity and the DTM, and a positive correlation between metallicity and the dust-to-gas (DTG) ratio, in good agreement with the shape and normalisation of the observed relations. We also match the normalisation of the observed stellar mass -- dust mass relation over a wide range of redshifts, and to the dust mass function at $z=0$. Our results are important in interpreting observations on the dust content of galaxies across cosmic time, particularly so at high redshift.","Aswin P. Vijayan, Scott J. Clay, Peter A.

321,"We present the concept of BlueMUSE, a blue-optimised, medium spectral resolution, panoramic integral field spectrograph based on the MUSE concept and proposed for the Very Large Telescope. With an optimised transmission down to 350 nm, a larger FoV (1.4 x 1.4 arcmin$^2$) and a higher spectral resolution compared to MUSE, BlueMUSE will open up a new range of galactic and extragalactic science cases allowed by its specific capabilities, beyond those possible with MUSE. For example a survey of massive stars in our galaxy and the Local Group will increase the known population of massive stars by a factor $>$100, to answer key questions about their evolution. Deep field observations with BlueMUSE will also significantly increase samples of Lyman-alpha emitters, spanning the era of Cosmic Noon. This will revolutionise the study of the distant Universe: allowing the intergalactic medium to be detected unambiguously in emission, enabling the study of the exchange of baryons between galaxies and their surroundings. By 2030, at a time when the focus of most of the new large facilities (ELT, JWST) will be on the infra-red, BlueMUSE will be a unique facility, outperforming any ELT instrument in the Blue/UV.

322,"In this first paper of the series, we present initial results of newly upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observation of European Large-Area ISO Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) at 325 MHz with 32 MHz bandwidth. Precise measurement of fluctuations in Galactic and extragalactic foreground emission as a function of frequency as well as angular scale is necessary for detecting redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from Cosmic Dawn, Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and post-reionization epoch. Here, for the first time we have statistically quantified the Galactic and extragalactic foreground sources in the ELAIS-N1 field in the form of angular power spectrum using the newly developed Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE). We have calibrated the data with and without direction-dependent calibration techniques. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of TGE against the direction dependent effects by using higher tapering of field of view (FoV). We have found that diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (DGSE) dominates the sky, after point source subtraction, across the angular multipole range $ 1115 \leqslant \mathcal{\ell} \leqslant 5083 $ and $ 1565 \leqslant \mathcal{\ell} \leqslant 4754 $ for direction-dependent and -independent calibrated visibilities respectively. The statistical fluctuations in DGSE has been quantified as a power law of the form $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{\ell}}= A \mathcal{\ell}^{-\beta} $. The best fitted values of (A, $\beta$) are ($ 62 \pm 6$ $mK^{2}$, $2.55 \pm 0.3 $) and ($ 48 \pm 4$ $mK^{2}$, $2.28 \pm 0.4 $ ) for the two different calibration approaches. For both the cases, the power law index is consistent with the previous measurements of DGSE in other parts of sky.","Arnab Chakraborty, Abhirup Datta, Samir Choudhuri, Nirupam Roy, Huib Intema, Madhurima Choudhury, Kanan K.

323,"One source of error in high-precision radial velocity measurements of exoplanet host stars is chromatic change in Earth's atmospheric transmission during observations. Mitigation of this error requires that the photon-weighted barycentric correction be applied as a function of wavelength across the stellar spectrum. We have designed a system for chromatic photon-weighted barycentric corrections with the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES) and present results from the first year of operations, based on radial velocity measurements of more than $10^3$ high-resolution stellar spectra. For observation times longer than 250 seconds, we find that if the chromatic component of the barycentric corrections is ignored, a range of radial velocity errors up to 1 m s$^{-1}$ can be incurred with cross-correlation, depending on the nightly atmospheric conditions. For this distribution of errors, the standard deviation is 8.4 cm s$^{-1}$ for G-type stars, 8.5 cm s$^{-1}$ for K-type stars, and 2.1 cm s$^{-1}$ for M-type stars. This error is reduced to well-below the instrumental and photon-noise limited floor by frequent flux sampling of the observed star with a low-resolution exposure meter spectrograph.","Ryan Blackman, Joel Ong, Debra Fischer","11 pages, 7 figures, accepted to AJ",1906.01653v1,No journal ref found,Debra Fischer,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01653v1,2019-06-04 18:00:15+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.IM,The Measured Impact of Chromatic Atmospheric Effects on Barycentric   Corrections: Results from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph,2019-06-04 18:00:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01653v1

We thus use existing lower energy data and X-ray variability measurements in the context of a basic synchro-Compton model to predict the X-ray polarization level and the probability of detection success for individual sources, listing the most attractive candidates for an IXPE campaign. We find that, as expected, several high-peak blazars such as Mrk 421 can be easily measured in 100 ksec exposures. Most low peak sources should only be accessible to triggered campaigns during bright flares.

325,"The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a well-established standard candle used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The TRGB luminosity is typically measured in the I-band, where the luminosity has little dependency on stellar age or stellar metallicity. As the TRGB is brighter at wavelengths redder than the I-band, observational gains can be made if the TRGB luminosity can be robustly calibrated at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest given the infrared capabilities that will be available with the James Webb Space Telescope and an important calibration consideration for using TRGB distances as part of an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Here, we use simulated photometry to investigate the dependency of the TRGB luminosity on stellar age and metallicity as a function of wavelength (475 nm - 4.5 micron). We find intrinsic variations in the TRGB magnitude to increase from a few hundredths of a magnitude at 800-900 nm to ~0.6 mag by 1.5 micron. We show that variations at the longer infrared wavelengths can be reduced to 0.02-0.05 mag (1-2% accuracy in distance) with careful calibrations that account for changes in age and metal content. These represent the minimum uncertainties; observational uncertainties will be higher. Such calibration efforts may also provide independent constraints of the age and metallicity of stellar halos where TRGB distances are best measured. At 3.6 and 4.5 micron, the TRGB magnitude is predicted to vary up to ~0.15 mag even after corrections for stellar age and metallicity, making these wavelengths less suitable for precision distances.","Kristen.

We have performed stellar population analysis using MUSE optical spectra of the spiral galaxy NGC 628 and find that current maximum star formation in spatially resolved regions is regulated according to the level of star formation in the recent past. We propose a model based on the self-regulator or ""bathtub"" models, but for spatially resolved regions of the galaxy. We name it the ""resolved self-regulator model"" and show that the predictions of this model are in agreement with the presented observations. We observe star formation self-regulation and estimate the mass-loading factor, $\eta=2.5 \pm 0.5$, consistent with values predicted by galaxy formation models. The method described here will help provide better constraints on those models.","Javier Zaragoza-Cardiel, Jacopo Fritz, Itziar Aretxaga, Divakara Mayya, Daniel Rosa-González, John E.

327,"The clumpiness of dark matter on sub-kpc scales is highly sensitive to the tidal evolution and survival of subhaloes. In agreement with previous studies, we show that N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the scale of the resolution limit of the simulation. These density cores drive the artificial tidal disruption of subhaloes. We run controlled simulations of the tidal evolution of a single subhalo where we repeatedly reconstruct the density cusp, preventing artificial disruption. This allows us to follow the evolution of the subhalo for arbitrarily large fractions of tidally stripped mass. Based on this numerical evidence in combination with simple dynamical arguments, we argue that cuspy dark matter subhaloes cannot be completely disrupted by smooth tidal fields. Modelling stars as collisionless tracers of the underlying potential, we furthermore study the tidal evolution of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using a model of the Tucana III dwarf as an example, we show that tides can strip dwarf galaxies down to sub-solar luminosities. The remnant 'micro-galaxies' would appear as co-moving groups of metal-poor, low-mass stars of similar age, embedded in sub-kpc dark matter subhaloes.","Raphaël Errani, Jorge Peñarrubia","submitted to MNRAS. 10 pages, 9 figures. comments welcome",1906.01642v1,No journal ref found,Jorge Peñarrubia,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01642v1,2019-06-04 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Can tides disrupt cold dark matter subhaloes?,2019-06-04 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01642v1
328,"We measure differences in the emission line flux from the circumgalactic medium, CGM, of galaxies in different environments. Such differences could be a critical clue in explaining a range of galaxy properties that depend on environment. Using large samples of stacked archival spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the H$\alpha$ + [N {\small II}] emission line flux from the CGM within 50 kpc of $\sim$ L$^*$ galaxies is lower both for galaxies that lie within a projected distance of $\sim$ 500 kpc from a massive ($M_*>10^{11} M_\odot$) galaxy and for galaxies in richer/denser environments. The environmental differences are statistically significant even after we control for galaxy mass and morphology. We interpret these observations as a direct signature of environmentally-caused strangulation. We present a simple, heuristic model for the effect of a massive parent galaxy. In this model, the CGM cool gas fraction within 50 kpc is significantly decreased for galaxies that lie within 700 kpc of a massive galaxy, with about 80\% of the cool gas removed even when the galaxy is at a distance of 500 kpc from its massive parent. However, we discuss alternative physical causes for the observed behavior and discuss ways forward in addressing open questions.","Huanian Zhang, Dennis Zaritsky, Peter Behroozi, Jessica Werk","11 pages, 10 figures",1906.01643v1,No journal ref found,Jessica Werk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01643v1,2019-06-04 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,On The Effect of Environment on Line Emission from the Circumgalactic   Medium,2019-06-04 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01643v1
329,"We present a detailed study of a high-redshift iron low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) quasar (SDSS1214 at $z = 1.046$), including new interferometric $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 observations, optical through far-infrared photometry, and mid-infrared spectroscopy. The CO line is well-fit by a single Gaussian centered 40 kms$^{-1}$ away from the systemic velocity and implies a total molecular gas mass of $M_\textrm{gas} = 7.3 \times 10^{10} \textrm{M}_\odot$. The infrared SED requires three components: an active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, an AGN polar dust component, and a starburst. The starburst dominates the infrared emission with a luminosity of log($L_\textrm{SB}[\textrm{L}_\odot]) = 12.91^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, implying a star formation rate of about 2000 $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest known among FeLoBAL quasars. The AGN torus and polar dust components are less luminous, at log($L_\textrm{AGN}[\textrm{L}_\odot]) = 12.36^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ and log($L_\textrm{dust}[\textrm{L}_\odot]) = 11.75^{+0.26}_{-0.46}$, respectively. If all of the molecular gas is used to fuel the ongoing star formation, then the lower limit on the subsequent duration of the starburst is 40 Myr. We do not find conclusive evidence that the AGN is affecting the CO gas reservoir. The properties of SDSS1214 are consistent with it representing the endpoint of an obscured starburst transitioning through a LoBAL phase to that of a classical quasar.","Lura K.

330,"We examine the origin of scatter in the relationship between the gas fraction and mass of dark matter haloes hosting present-day $\sim L^\star$ central galaxies in the EAGLE simulations. The scatter is uncorrelated with the accretion rate of the central galaxy's black hole (BH), but correlates strongly and negatively with the BH's mass, implicating differences in the expulsion of gas by active galactic nucleus feedback, throughout the assembly of the halo, as the main cause of scatter. Haloes whose central galaxies host undermassive BHs also tend to retain a higher gas fraction, and exhibit elevated star formation rates (SFRs). Diversity in the mass of central BHs stems primarily from diversity in the dark matter halo binding energy, as these quantities are strongly and positively correlated at fixed halo mass, such that $\sim L^\star$ galaxies hosted by haloes that are more (less) tightly-bound develop central BHs that are more (less) massive than is typical for their halo mass. Variations in the halo gas fraction at fixed halo mass are reflected in both the soft X-ray luminosity and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, suggesting that the prediction of a strong coupling between the properties of galaxies and their halo gas fractions can be tested with measurements of these diagnostics for galaxies with diverse SFRs but similar halo masses.","Jonathan J.

331,"Using Jeans modelling, we calculate the velocity dispersion profile of the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) Dragonfly 44 in MOND. For the nominal mass-to-light ratio from the literature and an isotropic profile, the agreement with the data is excellent near the center of the galaxy. However, in modified gravity, close to the cluster core, the gravitational environment should bring the galaxy back towards the Newtonian behavior. This success of the isolated MOND prediction for the central velocity dispersion could then mean that the galaxy is at large distances ($\gg5$ Mpc) from the cluster core, as hinted by the fact that close-by UDGs share similar velocities with a dispersion well below that of the cluster itself. There is however a two-sigma tension in the outer part of the UDG due to an increase of the observed dispersion profile with respect to the flat MOND prediction. This deviation could simply be a measurement error. Other possibilities could be, for a UDG far from the cluster, a higher-than-nominal baryonic mass with a tangentially anisotropic dispersion profile, or even a sign of a dark baryonic halo. If the UDG is closer to the cluster core, the deviation could be a sign that it is in the process of disruption.","Michal Bílek, Oliver Müller, Benoit Famaey","5 pages, 2 figures.

332,"We study the spin alignment of galaxies and halos with respect to filaments and walls of the cosmic web, identified with DisPerSE, using the SIMBA simulation from z=0-2. Massive halos' spins are oriented perpendicularly to their closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend to have their spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar mass-dependent spin flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal particularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting that galaxies' spins retain memory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and rotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments, while quiescent and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially perpendicular orientation; the star formation trend can be fully explained by the stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend cannot. There is a strong dependence on HI mass, such that high-HI galaxies tend to have parallel spins while low-HI galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when matching samples in stellar mass, suggesting that HI content traces anisotropic infall more faithfully than the stellar component. Finally, at fixed stellar mass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's density, with parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These findings are consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a significant correlation between galactic spin and the larger scale tides that are important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies. SIMBA allows us to rule out numerical grid locking as the cause of previously-seen low mass alignment.","Katarina Kraljic, Romeel Dave, Christophe Pichon","21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1906.01623v1,No journal ref found,Christophe Pichon,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01623v1,2019-06-04 17:56:57+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,And yet it flips: connecting galactic spin and the cosmic web,2019-06-04 17:56:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01623v1
333,"Accretion at super-Eddington rates is expected to be accompanied by strong outflows. Such outflows are observed in Galactic X-ray binaries and extragalactic Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). However, due to their large source distances, ULX outflows are challenging to detect and study in detail. Galactic neutron stars accreting from a Be-star companion at super-Eddington rates show many similarities to ULX pulsars, and therefore offer an alternative approach to study outflows in this accretion regime. Here, we present Chandra high-resolution spectroscopy of such a super-Eddington accreting neutron star, Swift J0243.6+6124, to search for wind outflow signatures during the peak of its 2017/2018 giant outburst. We detect narrow emission features at rest from Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe. In addition, we detect a collection of absorption features which can be identified in two ways: either as all Fe transitions at rest (with a possible contribution from Mg), or a combination of three blue-shifted Ne and Mg lines at $\sim 0.22c$, while the remaining lines are at rest. The second scenario would imply an outflow with a velocity similar to those seen in ULXs, including the ULX pulsar NGC 300 ULX-1. This result would also imply that Swift J0243.6+6124 launches both a jet, detected in radio and reported previously, and an ultra-fast wind outflow simultaneously at super-Eddington accretion rates.","J. van den Eijnden, N.

334,"Modifications of General Relativity leave their imprint both on the cosmic expansion history through a non-trivial dark energy equation of state, and on the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the scalar and in the tensor sectors. In particular, the modification in the tensor sector gives rise to a notion of gravitational-wave (GW) luminosity distance, different from the standard electromagnetic luminosity distance, that can be studied with standard sirens at GW detectors such as LISA or third-generation ground based experiments. We discuss the predictions for modified GW propagation from some of the best studied theories of modified gravity, such as Horndeski or the more general degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories, non-local infrared modifications of gravity, bigravity theories and the corresponding phenomenon of GW oscillation, as well as theories with extra or varying dimensions. We show that modified GW propagation is a completely generic phenomenon in modified gravity. We then use a simple parametrization of the effect in terms of two parameters $(\Xi_0,n)$, that is shown to fit well the results from a large class of models, to study the prospects of observing modified GW propagation using supermassive black hole binaries as standard sirens with LISA. We construct mock source catalogs and perform detailed Markov Chain Monte Carlo studies of the likelihood obtained from LISA standard sirens alone, as well as by combining them with CMB, BAO and SNe data to reduce the degeneracies between cosmological parameters. We find that the combination of LISA with the other cosmological datasets allows one to measure the parameter $\Xi_0$ that characterizes modified GW propagation to the percent level accuracy, sufficient to test several modified gravity theories.

We detect compact (r=8-10 pc), luminous, mm continuum emission in the core of IC 860, with brightness temperatures $T_{\rm B}>$ 280 K. The 45 GHz continuum is equally compact, but fainter in flux. We suggest that the 3 to 0.8 mm continuum is opaque at mm-wavelengths, implying a very large H$_2$ column density $N$(H$_2$) of 1e26 cm-2, and that it emerges from hot dust with temperature $T_{\rm d} \sim 280$ K. Vibrationally excited lines of HCN $\nu_2$=1f J=4-3 and 3-2 (HCN-VIB) are seen in emission and resolved on scales of 40-50 pc. The HCN-VIB emission reveals a north-south nuclear velocity gradient with projected rotation velocities of v=100 kms$^{-1}$ at r=10 pc. The brightest HCN-VIB emission is oriented perpendicular to the velocity gradient. Ground state lines of HCN 3-2, 4-3, HC$^{15}$N 4-3, HCO$^+$ 3-2, 4-3 and CS 7-6, show complex line absorption and emission features. HCN and HCO$^+$ have red-shifted, reversed P-Cygni profiles consistent with gas inflows of $\sim$50 kms$^{-1}$. The absorption features can be traced from the north-east into the nucleus. In contrast, CS 7-6 shows blue-shifted line wings extending to -180 kms$^{-1}$. We suggest that a dense and slow outflow is hidden behind a foreground layer of inflowing gas.   It appears that the centre of IC 860 is in a phase of rapid evolution where an inflow is building up the nuclear column density of gas. A slow, dense outflow may be signalling the onset of feedback. The inner, r=10 pc, IR luminosity can be powered by an accreting black hole and/or a compact starburst with a top-heavy initial mass function.","S. Aalto, S. Muller, S. König, N. Falstad, J.

336,"The Alfv\'en wave energy flux in the corona can be explored using the electron density and velocity amplitude of the waves. The velocity amplitude of Alfv\'en waves can be obtained from the non-thermal velocity of the spectral line profiles. Previous calculations of the Alfv\'en wave energy flux with height in active regions and polar coronal holes have provided evidence for the damping of Alfv\'en waves with height. We present off-limb Hinode EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS) observations of a long coronal loop up to 1.4~R$_\odot$. We have obtained the electron density along the loop and found the loop to be almost in hydrostatic equilibrium. We obtained the temperature using the EM-loci method and found the loop to be isothermal across, as well as along, the loop with a temperature of about 1.37 MK. We significantly improve the estimate of non-thermal velocities over previous studies by using the estimated ion (equal to electron) temperature. Estimates of electron densities are improved using the significant updates of the CHIANTI v.8 atomic data. More accurate measurements of propagating Alfv\'en wave energy along the coronal loop and its damping are presented up to distances of 1.4 R$_\odot$, further than have been previously explored. The Alfv\'en wave energy flux obtained could contribute to a significant part of the coronal losses due to radiation along the loop.","Girjesh R. Gupta, G. Del Zanna, H. E.

337,"We use 25 simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project to define and characterize a variety of kinematic stellar structures: thin and thick discs, large scale single discs, classical and pseudo bulges, spheroids, inner discs, and stellar haloes. These structures have masses, spins, shapes and rotational support in good agreement with theoretical expectations and observational data. Above a dark matter halo mass of $2.5\times10^{\rm~11}M_{\rm\odot}$, all galaxies have a classical bulge and 70\% have a thin and thick disc. The kinematic (thin) discs follow a power-law relation between angular momentum and stellar mass $J_{\rm *}=3.4M_{\rm *}^{\rm1.26\pm0.06}$, in very good agreement with the prediction based on the empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation in the same mass range, and show a strong correlation between maximum `observed' rotation velocity and dark matter halo circular velocity $v_{\rm c}=6.4v_{\rm max}^{0.64\pm0.04}$. Tracing back in time these structures' progenitors, we find all to lose a fraction $1-f_j$ of their maximum angular momentum. Thin discs are significantly better at retaining their high-redshift spins ($f_j\sim0.70$) than thick ones ($f_j\sim0.40$).

Comparisons between astronomical observations of these cooling transients and model calculations of neutron star crust cooling have frequently been used to constrain neutron star properties such as the mass, radius, crust composition, and presence of nuclear pasta. These calculations often use a fixed pressure at which the crust-core transition happens, though this quantity depends on the dense matter equation of state. We demonstrate that varying the crust-core transition pressure in a manner consistent with adopting various equations of state results in modest changes to the crust cooling light curve. This validates the approach adopted in most crust cooling studies to date, where the neutron star mass and radius are varied while leaving the crust-core transition pressure constant.","Sudhanva Lalit, Zach Meisel, Edward F.

339,"Context. Stellar magnetic fields are one of the candidates often invoked to explain the missing transport of angular momentum observed in the models of stellar interiors. However, the properties of an internal magnetic field and the consequences of its presence on stellar evolution are largely unknown.   Aims. We study the effect of an axisymmetric internal magnetic field on the frequency of gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars to check whether gravity modes can be used to detect and probe such a field.   Methods. Rotation is taken into account using the traditional approximation of rotation and the effect of the magnetic field is computed using a perturbative approach. As a proof of concept, we compute frequency shifts due to a mixed (i.e. with both poloidal and toroidal components) fossil magnetic field for a representative model of a known magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly pulsating B-type star, namely HD 43317.   Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field scale with the square of its amplitude. A magnetic field with a near-core strength of order 150 kG (which is consistent with the observed surface field strength of order 1 kG) leads to signatures that are detectable in period spacings for high-radial-order gravity modes.   Conclusions. The predicted frequency shifts can be used to constrain internal magnetic fields and offers the potential for a significant step forward in our interpretation of the observed structure of gravity-mode period spacing patterns in rapidly rotating stars.","V.

Small uncertainties in the characterisation of instrument properties such as the spectral filters can lead to a leakage of the intensity signal to polarisation and can possibly bias any measurement of a primordial signal. In this paper we discuss methods for avoiding and correcting for the intensity to polarisation leakage due to bandpass mismatch among detector sets. We develop a template fitting map-maker to obtain an unbiased estimate of the leakage signal and subtract it out of the total signal. Using simulations we show how such a method can reduce the bias on the observed B-mode signal by up to $3$ orders of magnitude in power.,"Ranajoy Banerji, Guillaume Patanchon, Jacques Delabrouille, Masashi Hazumi, Duc Thuong Hoang, Hirokazu Ishino, Tomotake Matsumura",No comment found,1902.00569v3,No journal ref found,Tomotake Matsumura,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00569v3,2019-02-01 21:48:25+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.CO,Bandpass mismatch error for satellite CMB experiments II: Correcting for   the spurious signal,2019-06-04 15:42:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00569v3

342,"Multimessenger observations may hold the key to learn about the most energetic sources in the universe. The recent construction of large scale observatories opened new possibilities in testing non thermal cosmic processes with alternative probes, such as high energy neutrinos and gravitational waves. We propose to combine information from gravitational wave detections, neutrino observations and electromagnetic signals to obtain a comprehensive picture of some of the most extreme cosmic processes. Gravitational waves are indicative of source dynamics, such as the formation, evolution and interaction of compact objects. These compact objects can play an important role in astrophysical particle acceleration, and are interesting candidates for neutrino and in general high-energy astroparticle studies. In particular we will concentrate on the most promising gravitational wave emitter sources: compact stellar remnants. The merger of binary black holes, binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries are abundant gravitational wave sources and will likely make up the majority of detections. However, stellar core collapse with rapidly rotating core may also be significant gravitational wave emitter, while slower rotating cores may be detectable only at closer distances. The joint detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from these sources will probe the physics of the sources and will be a smoking gun of the presence of hadrons in these objects which is still an open question. Conversely, the non-detection of neutrinos or gravitational waves from these sources will be fundamental to constrain the hadronic content.",Dafne Guetta,"Published in EPJ Web Conf.

343,"We study the coronal dimming caused by the fast halo CME (deprojected speed v =1250 km s $^{-1})$ associated with the C3.7 two-ribbon flare on 2012 September 27, using Hinode/EIS spectroscopy and SDO/AIA Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis. The event reveals bipolar core dimmings encompassed by hook-shaped flare ribbons located at the ends of the flare-related polarity inversion line, and marking the footpoints of the erupting filament. In coronal emission lines of $\log T \, [{\rm K}] = 5.8-6.3$, distinct double component spectra indicative of the superposition of a stationary and a fast up-flowing plasma component with velocities up to 130 km s$^{-1}$ are observed at regions, which were mapped by the scanning EIS slit close in time of their impulsive dimming onset. The outflowing plasma component is found to be of the same order and even dominant over the stationary one, with electron densities in the upflowing component of $2\times 10^{9}$cm$^{-3}$ at $\log T \, [{\rm K}] = 6.2$. The density evolution in core dimming regions derived from SDO/AIA DEM analysis reveals impulsive reductions by $40 - 50\%$ within $\lesssim$10 min, and remains at these reduced levels for hours. The mass loss rate derived from the EIS spectroscopy in the dimming regions is of the same order than the mass increase rate observed in the associated white light CME ($1 \times 10^{12} {\rm \; g \; s}^{-1}$), indicative that the CME mass increase in the coronagraphic field-of-view results from plasma flows from below and not from material piled-up ahead of the outward moving and expanding CME front.","Astrid M.

344,"The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a known mechanism for penetration of solar wind matter into the magnetosphere. Using three-dimensional, resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, the double mid-latitude reconnection (DMLR) process was shown to efficiently exchange solar wind matter into the magnetosphere, through mixing and reconnection. Here, we compute test particle orbits through DMLR configurations. In the instantaneous electromagnetic fields, charged particle trajectories are integrated using the guiding centre approximation. The mechanisms involved in the electron particle orbits and their kinetic energy evolutions are studied in detail, to identify specific signatures of the DMLR through particle characteristics. The charged particle orbits are influenced mainly by magnetic curvature drifts. We identify complex, temporarily trapped, trajectories where the combined (parallel) electric field and (reconnected) magnetic field variations realize local cavities where particles gain energy before escaping. We do this in various representative stages during the DMLR development.","Matthieu Leroy, Bart Ripperda, Rony Keppens",manuscript submitted to JGR: Space Physics,1810.04324v2,No journal ref found,Rony Keppens,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04324v2,2018-10-10 01:35:50+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|physics.plasm-ph,Particle orbits at the magnetopause: Kelvin-Helmholtz induced trapping,2019-06-04 15:20:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04324v2
345,"Newly forming proto-planets are expected to create cavities and substructures in young, gas-rich proto-planetary disks, but they are difficult to detect as they could be confused with disk features affected by advanced image-analysis techniques. Recently, a planet was discovered inside the gap of the transitional disk of the T-Tauri star PDS 70. Here we report on the detection of strong H-alpha emission from two distinct locations in the PDS 70 system, one corresponding to the previously discovered planet PDS 70 b, which confirms the earlier H$\alpha$ detection, and another located close to the outer-edge of the gap, coinciding with a previously identified bright dust spot in the disk and with a small opening in a ring of molecular emission. We identify this second H$\alpha$ peak as a second proto-planet in the PDS 70 system. The H$\alpha$ emission spectra of both proto-planets indicate ongoing accretion onto the proto-planets, which appear to be near a 2:1 mean motion resonance. Our observations show that adaptive-optics-assisted, medium-resolution, integral-field spectroscopy with MUSE targeting accretion signatures will be a powerful way to trace ongoing planet formation in transitional disks at different stages of their evolution. Finding more young planetary systems in mean motion resonance would give credibility to the Grand Tack hypothesis in which Jupiter and Saturn migrated in a resonance orbit during the early formation period of our Solar System.","S.

346,"A new formula for predicting solar cycles based on the current theoretical understanding of the solar cycle from flux transport dynamo is presented. Two important processes---fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and variations in the meridional circulation, which are believed to be responsible for irregularities of the solar cycle---are constrained by using observational data. We take the polar field near minima of the cycle as a measure of the randomness in the Babcock-Leighton process, and the decay rate near the minima as a consequence of the change in meridional circulation. We couple these two observationally derived quantities into a single formula to predict the amplitude of the future solar cycle. Our new formula suggests that the cycle 25 would be a moderate cycle. Whether this formula for predicting the future solar cycle can be justified theoretically is also discussed using simulations from the flux transport dynamo model.","Gopal Hazra, Arnab Rai Choudhuri","12 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ",1811.01363v2,No journal ref found,Arnab Rai Choudhuri,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01363v2,2018-11-04 12:55:35+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,A New Formula for Predicting Solar Cycles,2019-06-04 14:45:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01363v2
347,"The amount of water vapor in the terrestrial atmosphere is highly variable both spatially and temporally. In the tropics it sometimes constitutes 4-5% of the atmosphere. At the same time collisional broadening of spectral lines by water vapor is much larger than that by nitrogen and oxygen. Therefore, in order to accurately characterize and model spectra of the atmospheres with significant amounts of water vapor, the line-shape parameters for spectral lines broadened by water vapor are required. In this work, the line-broadening coefficients (and their temperature dependence exponents) due to the pressure of water vapor for lines of CO2, N2O, CO, CH4, O2, NH3, and H2S from both experimental and theoretical studies were collected and carefully reviewed.

348,"Tight constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes can be deduced across a vast range of masses, with the exception of those light enough to fully evaporate before nucleosynthesis. This hypothetical population is almost entirely unconstrained, to the point where the early Universe could pass through a matter-dominated phase with primordial black holes as the primary component. The only obvious relic of this phase would be Hawking radiated gravitons which would constitute a stochastic gravitational wave background in the present-day Universe, albeit at frequencies far beyond the scope of any planned detector technology. This paper explores the effects of classical mergers in such a matter dominated phase. For certain ranges of parameters, a significant fraction of the black holes merge, providing an additional, classical source of primordial gravitational waves. The resulting stochastic background typically has a lower amplitude than the Hawking background and lies at less extreme frequencies, but is unlikely to be easily detectable, with a maximal present day density of $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-12}$ and frequencies between $10^{15} - 10^{19}$ Hz. We also asses the impact of radiation accretion on the lifetimes of such primordial black holes and find that it increases the black hole mass by $\sim 14 \%$ and the lifetimes by about $50 \%$. However, this does not qualitatively change any of our conclusions.","J. Luna Zagorac, Richard Easther, Nikhil Padmanabhan","17 pages, 5 figures; added references, comments on uniform mass

349,"The intrinsic strength of the Ly$\alpha$ line in young, star-forming systems makes it a special tool for studying high-redshift galaxies. However, interpreting observations remains challenging due to the complex radiative transfer involved. Here, we combine state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of 'Althaea', a prototypical Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG, stellar mass $M_{\star}$$\simeq$ $10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot})$ at $z=7.2$, with detailed radiative transfer computations of dust/continuum, [CII] 158 $\mu$m, and Ly$\alpha$ to clarify the relation between the galaxy properties and its Ly$\alpha$ emission. Althaea exhibits low ($f_\alpha< 1\%$) Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions and Equivalent Widths, EW $\lesssim 6$ Angstrom for the simulated lines of sight, with a large scatter. The correlation between escape fraction and inclination is weak, as a result of the rather chaotic structure of high-redshift galaxies. Low $f_\alpha$ values persist even if we artificially remove neutral gas around star forming regions to mimick the presence of HII regions. The high attenuation is primarily caused by dust clumps co-located with young stellar clusters. We can turn Althaea into a Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) only if we artificially remove dust from the clumps, yielding EWs up to $22$ Angstrom. Our study suggests that the LBG-LAE duty-cycle required by recent clustering measurements poses the challenging problem of a dynamically changing dust attenuation. Finally, we find an anti-correlation between the magnitude of Ly$\alpha$-[CII] line velocity shift and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity.","Christoph Behrens, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara, Simona Gallerani, Livia Vallini",published in MNRAS,1903.06185v2,No journal ref found,Livia Vallini,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06185v2,2019-03-14 18:00:45+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Lyα emission from galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization,2019-06-04 13:46:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06185v2
350,"It has recently been proposed that global or local turbulence models can be used to simulate core-collapse supernova explosions in spherical symmetry (1D) more consistently than with traditional approaches for parameterised 1D models. However, a closer analysis of the proposed schemes reveals important consistency problems. Most notably, they systematically violate energy conservation as they do not balance buoyant energy generation with terms that reduce potential energy, thus failing to account for the physical source of energy that buoyant convection feeds on. We also point out other non-trivial consistency requirements for viable turbulence models. The model of Kuhfuss (1986) proves more consistent than the newly proposed approaches for supernovae, but still cannot account naturally for all the relevant physics for predicting explosion properties. We perform numerical simulations for a $20 M_\odot$ progenitor to further illustrate problems of 1D turbulence models. If the buoyant driving term is formulated in a conservative manner, the explosion energy of $\mathord{\sim}2\times 10^{51}\, \mathrm{erg}$ for the corresponding non-conservative turbulence model is reduced to $<10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$ even though the shock expands continuously. This demonstrates that the conservation problem cannot be ignored. Although plausible energies can be reached using an energy-conserving model when turbulent viscosity is included, it is doubtful whether the energy budget of the explosion is regulated by the same mechanism as in multi-dimensional models. We conclude that 1D turbulence models based on a spherical Reynolds decomposition cannot provide a more consistent approach to supernova explosion and remnant properties than other phenomenological approaches before some fundamental problems are addressed.",Bernhard Müller,"15 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS.

351,"In a star cluster with a sufficiently large escape velocity, black holes (BHs) that are produced by BH mergers can be retained, dynamically form new BH binaries, and merge again. This process can repeat several times and lead to significant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH that can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine how its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt an analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in the cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body relaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the hardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global properties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial escape velocity $\gtrsim 300\rm km\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\gtrsim 10^5\ M_\odot\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the mass range $100-10^5 \,M_\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by pair-instability supernovae. This result is independent of cluster metallicity and the initial BH spin distribution. We show that about $10\%$ of the present-day nuclear star clusters meet these extreme conditions, and estimate that BH binary mergers with total mass $\gtrsim 100\,M _\odot$ should be produced in these systems at a maximum rate $\approx 0.05 \,\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$, corresponding to one detectable event every few years with Advanced LIGO/VIRGO at design sensitivity. The contribution of globular clusters is likely to be negligible instead because the first BH merger remnant escapes following the relativistic kick. A possible connection of our results to the formation of massive BH seeds in galaxy nuclei and globular clusters is discussed.","Fabio Antonini, Mark Gieles, Alessia Gualandris","14 pages, 10 figures.

352,"There are growing amount of very high-resolution polarized scattered light images of circumstellar disks. Naturally, the question arises whether the circumplanetary disk forming around nascent planets can be detected with the same technique. Here we created scattered light mock observations at 1.2 and 1.6 microns for instruments like SPHERE and GPI, for various planetary masses and disk inclinations. We found that the detection of a circumplanetary disk is significantly favored if the planet is massive ($\geq 5 \rm{M_{Jup}}$) and the system is nearly face-on ($\leq 30^\circ$). Its detection is hindered by the neighboring circumstellar disk that also provides a strong polarized flux.

353,"One puzzling question in solar physics is the difference between elemental abundances in the photosphere and the corona. Elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) can be overabundant in the corona compared to the photosphere under certain circumstances. The same phenomenon has been observed on a handful of stars, while a few of them show the inverse effect. But not all the stars in the original sample had precise photospheric abundances derived from optical spectra, so for some the solar values were adopted. In this work we make homogeneous abundance measurements from optical spectroscopy.

355,"Context. The interaction between low-mass companions and the debris discs they reside in is still not fully understood. A debris disc can evolve due to self-stirring, a process in which planetesimals can excite their neighbours to the point of destructive collisions. In addition, the presence of a companion could further stir the disc (companion-stirring). Additional information is necessary to understand this fundamental step in the formation and evolution of a planetary system, and at the moment of writing only a handful of systems are known where a companion and a debris disc have both been detected and studied at the same time.   Aims. Our primary goal is to augment the sample of these systems and to understand the relative importance between self-stirring and companion-stirring.   Methods. In the course of the VLT/NaCo Imaging Survey for Planets around Young stars (ISPY), we observed HD 193571, an A0 debris disc hosting star at a distance of 68 pc with an age between 60 and 170 Myr. We obtained two sets of observations in L' band and a third epoch in H band using the GPI instrument at Gemini-South.   Results. A companion was detected in all three epochs at a projected separation of 11 au (0.17 arcsec), and co-motion was confirmed through proper motion analysis. Given the inferred disc size of 120 au, the companion appears to reside within the gap between the host star and the disc. Comparison between the L' and H band magnitude and evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of 0.31 - 0.39 solar masses .   Conclusions. We discovered a previously unknown M-dwarf companion around HD 193571, making it the third low-mass stellar object discovered within a debris disc. A comparison to self- and companion-stirring models suggests that the companion is likely responsible for the stirring of the disc.","Arianna Musso Barcucci, Ralf Launhardt, Grant M.

356,"There remain many open questions relating to the depletion of elements into dust, e.g., exactly how are C and O incorporated into dust in dense clouds and, in particular, what drives the disappearance of oxygen in the denser interstellar medium? This work is, in part, an attempt to explain the apparently anomalous incorporation of O atoms into dust in dense clouds. We re-visit the question of the depletion of the elements incorporated into the carbonaceous component of interstellar dust, i.e., C, H, O, N and S, in the light of recent analyses of the organics in comets, meteorites and interplanetary dust particles. We find that oxygen could be combined with ~ 10 to 20 % of the carbon in the dust in dense regions in the form of a difficult to observe, organic carbonate, which could explain the unaccounted for 170-255 ppm oxygen depletion. We conclude that, while C, O and N atoms are depleted into an amorphous a-C:H:O:N phase, we posit that a significant fraction of C and O atoms could be sequestered into an organic carbonate, which provides a viable solution to the oxygen depletion problem. Further, the thermal or photolytic decomposition of this carbonate may have a bearing on the formation of CO_2 in the ISM.","A. P. Jones, N.

357,"We present the results of an XMM-Newton observation of the slowly rotating ($P = 3.4$ s), highly magnetized ($B \approx 3 \times 10^{13}$ G) radio pulsar PSR J0726-2612. A previous X-ray observation with the Chandra satellite showed that some of the properties of PSR J0726-2612 are similar to those of the X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINSs), a small class of nearby slow pulsars characterized by purely thermal X-ray spectra and undetected in the radio band. We confirm the thermal nature of the X-ray emission of PSR J0726-2612, which can be fit by the sum of two blackbodies with temperatures $kT_1 = 0.074_{-0.011}^{+0.006}$ keV and $kT_2 = 0.14_{-0.02}^{+0.04}$ keV and emitting radii $R_1 = 10.4_{-2.8}^{+10.8}$ km and $R_2 = 0.5_{-0.3}^{+0.9}$ km, respectively (assuming a distance of 1 kpc). A broad absorption line modeled with a Gaussian profile centred at $0.39_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ keV is required in the fit. The pulse profile of PSR J0726-2612 is characterized by two peaks with similar intensity separated by two unequal minima, a shape and pulsed fraction that cannot be reproduced without invoking magnetic beaming of the X-ray emission. The presence of a single radio pulse suggests that in PSR J0726-2612 the angles that the dipole axis and the line of sight make with the rotation axis, $\xi$ and $\chi$ respectively, are similar. This geometry differs from that of the two radio-silent XDINSs with a double peaked pulse profile similar to that of PSR J0726-2612, for which $\xi \sim 90^\circ$ and $\chi \sim 45^\circ$ have been recently estimated. These results strengthen the similarity between PSR J0726-2612 and the XDINSs and support the possibility that the lack of radio emission from the latter might simply be due to an unfavourable viewing geometry.","Michela Rigoselli, Sandro Mereghetti, Valery Suleimanov, Alexander Y.

The two short and intermediate duration groups differ mostly in the peak flux. Therefore, the reanalysis of the BATSE data finds similar group structures than previously.

359,"We analyse in this work the propagation and geoeffectiveness of four successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that erupted from the Sun during 21--23 May 2013 and that were detected in interplanetary space by the Wind and/or STEREO-A spacecraft. All these CMEs featured critical aspects for understanding so-called ""problem space weather storms"" at Earth. In the first three events a limb CMEs resulted in moderately geoeffective in-situ structures at their target location in terms of the disturbance storm time (Dst) index (either measured or estimated). The fourth CME, which also caused a moderate geomagnetic response, erupted from close to the disc centre as seen from Earth, but it was not visible in coronagraph images from the spacecraft along the Sun--Earth line and appeared narrow and faint from off-angle viewpoints. Making the correct connection between CMEs at the Sun and their in-situ counterparts is often difficult for problem storms. We investigate these four CMEs using multiwavelength and multipoint remote-sensing observations (extreme ultraviolet, white light, and radio), aided by 3D heliospheric modelling, in order to follow their propagation in the corona and in interplanetary space and to assess their impact at 1 AU. Finally, we emphasise the difficulties in forecasting moderate space weather effects provoked by problematic and ambiguous events and the importance of multispacecraft data for observing and modelling problem storms.","Erika Palmerio, Camilla Scolini, David Barnes, Jasmina Magdalenić, Matthew J.

360,"A fundamental quantity in signal analysis is the metric $g_{ab}$ on parameter space, which quantifies the fractional ""mismatch"" $m$ between two (time- or frequency-domain) waveforms. When searching for weak gravitational-wave or electromagnetic signals from sources with unknown parameters $\lambda$ (masses, sky locations, frequencies, etc.) the metric can be used to create and/or characterize ""template banks"". These are grids of points in parameter space; the metric is used to ensure that the points are correctly separated from one another. For small coordinate separations $d\lambda^a$ between two points in parameter space, the traditional ansatz for the mismatch is a quadratic form $m=g_{ab} d\lambda^a d\lambda^b$. This is a good approximation for small separations but at large separations it diverges, whereas the actual mismatch is bounded. Here we introduce and discuss a simple ""spherical"" ansatz for the mismatch $m=\sin^2(\sqrt{g_{ab} d\lambda^a d\lambda^b})$. This agrees with the metric ansatz for small separations, but we show that in simple cases it provides a better (and bounded) approximation for large separations, and argue that this is also true in the generic case. This ansatz should provide a more accurate approximation of the mismatch for semi-coherent searches, and may also be of use when creating grids for hierarchical searches that (in some stages) operate at relatively large mismatch.",Bruce Allen,"8 pages, 2 figures, will be submitted to PRD",1906.01352v1,No journal ref found,Bruce Allen,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01352v1,2019-06-04 11:34:18+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.IM,Spherical ansatz for parameter-space metrics,2019-06-04 11:34:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01352v1
361,"We present 41 bursts from the first repeating fast radio burst discovered (FRB 121102). A deep search has allowed us to probe unprecedentedly low burst energies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the Arecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a third of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB signals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are likely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a striking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA observations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one that was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies that vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution of burst energies yields an index $-1.8\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the previously reported value of $\sim-0.7$. The discrepancy may be evidence for a more complex energy distribution. We place constraints on the possibility that the associated persistent radio source is generated by the emission of many faint bursts ($\sim700$ ms$^{-1}$). We do not see a connection between burst fluence and wait time. The distribution of wait times follows a log-normal distribution centered around $\sim200$ s; however, some bursts have wait times below 1 s and as short as 26 ms, which is consistent with previous reports of a bimodal distribution. We caution against exclusively integrating over the full observing band during FRB searches, because this can lower signal-to-noise.","K. Gourdji, D. Michilli, L. G. Spitler, J. W. T. Hessels, A.

362,"We study the formation and the subsequent mass growth of axion stars inside axion miniclusters. Numerically solving the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations with realistic initial conditions we find that the axion stars exhibit similar properties to solitonic cores in ultralight bosonic dark matter halos in terms of their radial density profiles and large-amplitude oscillations. A merger of two axion stars confirms a previously found empirical law for the mass of the merged axion star. Monitoring the axion star masses over time, we observe a mass growth consistent with the mass increase of Bose stars in the kinetic regime reported by Levkov et al., confirming that the mass evolution of axion stars can be understood in terms of wave condensation. Based on this result, we predict a saturation of mass growth in relation to the minicluster mass consistent with the core-halo mass relation previously found for ultra-light bosonic dark matter halos.","Benedikt Eggemeier, Jens C.

363,"The population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) shows a large variety of objects in terms of physical and dynamical properties. They are subject to planetary encounters and to strong solar wind and radiation effects. Their study is also motivated by practical reasons regarding space exploration and long-term probability of impact with the Earth. We aim to spectrally characterize a significant sample of NEAs with sizes in the range of $\sim$0.25 - 5.5 km (categorized as large), and search for connections between their spectral types and the orbital parameters. Optical spectra of NEAs were obtained using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) equipped with the IDS spectrograph. These observations are analyzed using taxonomic classification and by comparison with laboratory spectra of meteorites. A total number of 76 NEAs were observed. We classified 44 of them as Q/S-complex, 16 as B/C-complex, eight as V-types, and another eight belong to the remaining taxonomic classes. Our sample contains 27 asteroids categorized as potentially hazardous and 31 possible targets for space missions including (459872) 2014 EK24, (436724) 2011 UW158, and (67367) 2000 LY27. The spectral data corresponding to (276049) 2002 CE26 and (385186) 1994 AW1 shows the 0.7 $\mu$m feature which indicates the presence of hydrated minerals on their surface. We report that Q-types have the lowest perihelia (a median value and absolute deviation of $0.797\pm0.244$ AU) and are systematically larger than the S-type asteroids observed in our sample. We explain these observational evidences by thermal fatigue fragmentation as the main process for the rejuvenation of NEA surfaces. In general terms, the taxonomic distribution of our sample is similar to the previous studies and matches the broad groups of the inner main belt asteroids. Nevertheless, we found a wide diversity of spectra compared to the standard taxonomic types.","M. Popescu, O. Vaduvescu, J. de León, R. M. Gherase, J. Licandro, I. L. Boacă, A. B. Şonka, R. P.

365,"The first stable object to develop in the low-mass star formation process has long been predicted to be the first hydrostatic core (FHSC). Despite much effort, it has still yet to be definitively observed in nature. More specific observational signatures are required to enable observers to distinguish the FHSC from young, faint, but more evolved protostars. Here we present synthetic spectral line observations for CO, SO, CS and HCO$^+$ that were calculated from radiation (magneto)hydrodynamical models, chemical modelling and Monte Carlo radiative transfer. HCO$^+$ $(1-0)$ and SO $(8_7 - 7_6)$ spectra of the FHSC show variations for observations at a low inclination which may allow a candidate FHSC to be distinguished from a more evolved object. We find that the FHSC outflow is unlikely to be detectable with ALMA, which would discount the observed sources with slow outflows that are currently identified as candidate FHSCs. We compare the results of simulated ALMA observations with observed candidate FHSCs and recommend Oph A SM1N and N6-mm as the most promising candidates to follow up.","Alison K. Young, Matthew R.

366,"A large fraction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra are very hard below the peak. Indeed, the observed distribution of sub-peak power-law indices, $\alpha$, has been used as an argument for a photospheric origin of GRB spectra. Here, we investigate what fraction of GRBs have spectra that are consistent with emission from a photopshere in a non-dissipative outflow. This is the simplest possible photospheric emission scenario. We create synthetic spectra, with a range of peak energies, by folding the theoretical predictions through the detector response of the FERMI/GBM detector. These simulated spectral data are fit with typically employed empirical models. We find that the low-energy photon indices obtain values ranging $-0.4 < \alpha < 0.0$, peaking at around $-0.1$, thus covering a non-negligible fraction of observed values. These values are significantly softer than the asymptotic value of the theoretical spectrum of $\alpha \sim 0.4$. The reason for the $\alpha$-values to be much softer than expected, is the limitation of the empirical functions to capture the true curvature of the theoretical spectrum. We conclude that more than a $1/4$ of the bursts in the GBM catalogue have at least one time-resolved spectrum, whose $\alpha$-values are consistent with a non-dissipative outflow, releasing its thermal energy at the photosphere. The fraction of spectra consistent with emission from the photosphere will increase even more if dissipation of kinetic energy in the flow occurs below the photosphere.","Zeynep Acuner, Felix Ryde, Hoi-Fung Yu",Accepted; MNRAS,1906.01318v1,No journal ref found,Hoi-Fung Yu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01318v1,2019-06-04 10:19:12+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Non-dissipative photospheres in GRBs: Spectral appearance in the   Fermi/GBM catalogue,2019-06-04 10:19:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01318v1

369,"The mapping of galaxy clustering from real space to redshift space introduces the anisotropic property to the measured galaxy density power spectrum in redshift space, known as the redshift space distortion (RSD) effect. The mapping formula is intrinsically non-linear, which is complicated by the higher order polynomials due to indefinite orders of cross correlations between density and velocity fields, and the Finger--of--God (FoG) effect due to the randomness of the galaxy peculiar velocity field. In previous works, we have verified the robustness of advanced TNS mapping formula in our hybrid RSD model in dark matter case, where the halo bias models are not taken into account for the halo mapping formula in redshift space. Using 100 realizations of halo catalogs in N-body simulations, we find that our halo RSD model with the known halo bias model and the effective FoG function accurately predicts the halo power spectrum measurements, within 1$\sim$2% accuracy up to $k\sim 0.2h$/Mpc, depending on different halo masses and redshifts.","Yi Zheng, Yong-Seon Song, Minji Oh","33 pages, 12 figures.

370,"When a star gets too close to a supermassive black hole, it is torn apart by the tidal forces. Roughly half of the stellar mass becomes unbound and flies away at tremendous velocities - around $10^4$ km/s. In this work we explore the idea that the shock produced by the interaction of the unbound debris with the ambient medium gives rise to the synchrotron radio emission observed in several TDEs. We use a moving mesh numerical simulation to study the evolution of the unbound debris and the bow shock around it. We find that as the periapse distance of the star decreases, the outflow becomes faster and wider. A tidal disruption event whose periapse distance is a factor of 7 smaller than the tidal radius can account for the radio emission observed in ASASSN-14li. This model also allows us to obtain a more accurate estimate for the gas density around the centre of the host galaxy of ASASSN-14li.","Almog Yalinewich, Elad Steinberg, Tsvi Piran, Julian H.

371,"I present the mean metallicity distribution of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy based on photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I utilize an empirically calibrated set of stellar isochrones developed in previous work to estimate the metallicities of individual stars to a precision of $0.2$ dex for reasonably bright stars across the survey area. I also obtain more precise metallicity estimates using priors from the $Gaia$ parallaxes for relatively nearby stars. Close to the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|<2$ kpc), a mean metallicity map reveals deviations from the mirror symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres, displaying wave-like oscillations. The observed metallicity asymmetry structure is almost parallel to the Galactic mid-plane, and coincides with the previously known asymmetry in the stellar number density distribution. This result reinforces the previous notion of the plane-parallel vertical waves propagating through the disk, in which a local metallicity perturbation from the mean vertical metallicity gradient is induced by the phase-space wrapping of stars in the $Z$-$V_Z$ plane. The maximum amplitude of the metallicity asymmetry ($\Delta$[Fe/H]$\sim0.05$) implies that these stars have been pulled away from the Galactic mid-plane by an order of $\Delta|Z|\sim80$ pc as a massive halo substructure such as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy plunged through the Milky Way.

We find a total molecular gas mass of 1.6$\times$10$^9$ $M_\odot$ and we reveal the presence of filamentary components more extended than previously seen, up to a radius of 4 kpc. We find that the global star formation rate is $\sim$1 \Msol yr$^{-1}$, which yields a star formation efficiency (SFE) of 0.6 Gyr$^{-1}$ (depletion time $\tau =$1.5 Gyr), similar to those in disk galaxies. We show the most detailed view to date (40\,pc resolution) of the relation between molecular gas and star formation within the stellar component of an elliptical galaxy, from several kpc scale to the circumnuclear region close to the powerful radio jet. Although on average the SFEs are similar to those of spiral galaxies, the circumnuclear disk (CND) presents SFEs of 0.3 Gyr$^{-1}$, lower by a factor of 4 than the outer disk. The low SFE in the CND is in contrast to the high SFEs found in the literature for the circumnuclear regions of some nearby disk galaxies with nuclear activity, probably as a result of larger shear motions and longer AGN feedback. The higher SFEs in the outer disk suggests that only central molecular gas or filaments with sufficient density and strong shear motions will remain in $\sim$1 Gyr, which will later result in the compact molecular distributions and low SFEs usually seen in other giant ellipticals with cold gas.","D.

Both the temperature of background plasma ($T_0$) and the energy of energetic electrons ($v_e$) are considered to be important to the variation of the maximum growth rate ($\gamma_{max}$). Here we present a detailed parameter study on the effect of $T_0$ and $v_e$, within a regime of the frequency ratio ($10 \leq \frac{\omega_{pe}}{\Omega_{ce}} \leq 30$). In addition to $\gamma_{max}$, we also analyze the effect on the corresponding wave frequency ($\omega^r_{max}$) and propagation angle ($\theta_{max}$). We find that (1) $\gamma_{max}$ in-general decreases with increasing $v_e$, while its variation with $T_0$ is more complex depending on the exact value of $v_e$; (2) with increasing $T_0$ and $v_e$, $\omega^r_{max}$ presents step-wise profiles with jumps separated by gradual or very-weak variations, and due to the warm-plasma effect on the wave dispersion relation $\omega^r_{max}$ can vary within the hybrid band (the harmonic band containing the upper hybrid frequency) and the band higher; (3) the propagation is either perpendicular or quasi-perpendicular, and $\theta_{max}$ presents variations in line with those of $\omega^r_{max}$, as constrained by the resonance condition. We also examine the profiles of $\gamma_{max}$ with $\frac{\omega_{pe}}{\Omega_{ce}}$ for different combinations of $T_0$ and $v_e$ to clarify some earlier calculations which show inconsistent results.","Chuanyang Li, Yao Chen, Xiangliang Kong, M.

374,"Second only to initial mass, the rate of wind-driven mass loss determines the final mass of a massive star and the nature of its remnant. Motivated by the need to reconcile observational values and theory, we use a recently vetted technique to analyze the mass-loss rates in a sample of OB stars that generate bowshock nebulae. We measure peculiar velocities from new Gaia parallax and proper motion data and their spectral types from new optical and infrared spectroscopy. For our sample of 67 central stars in morphologically selected bowshocks nebulae, 67 are OB stars. The median peculiar velocity is 11 km/s, significantly smaller than classical `runaway star' velocities. Mass-loss rates for these O and early B stars agree with recently lowered theoretical predictions, ranging from ~10^-7 Msun/yr for mid-O dwarfs to 10^-9 Msun/yr for late-O dwarfs---a factor of about 2.7 lower than the often-used Vink et al. (2001) formulation. Our results provide the first observational mass-loss rates for B0--B3 dwarfs and giants---10^-9 to 10^-8 Msun/yr. We find evidence for an increase in the mass-loss rates below a critical effective temperature, consistent with predictions of the bi-stability phenomenon in the range Teff=19,000--27,000 K. The sample exhibits a correlation between modified wind momentum and luminosity, consistent in slope but lower by 0.43 dex in magnitude compared to canonical wind-luminosity relations. We identify a small subset of objects deviating most significantly from theoretical expectations as probable radiation-driven bow wave nebulae by virtue of their low stellar-to-nebular luminosity ratios. For these, the inferred mass-loss rates must be regarded as upper limits.","Henry A. Kobulnicky, William T. Chick, Matthew S.

375,"The Hubble constant problem is the discrepancy between different measurements of the Hubble constant in different scales. We show that this problem can be resolved within the general relativistic framework of the perturbation theory in the inhomogeneous universe, with the help of spatial averaging procedure over a finite local domain in the $t=\mbox{const.}$ hypersurface. The idea presented in this paper is unique in the sense that it has all of the following properties. a) It is based on the general relativistic perturbation theory, with ordinary dust matter only. No strange matter nor energy components are required. b) The employment of the spatially invariant averaging procedure on the finite domain is essential. c) The key is the first-order effect of the inhomogeneities in the linear perturbation theory. No non-linear effects are required.","Masumi Kasai, Toshifumi Futamase",No comment found,1904.09689v2,No journal ref found,Toshifumi Futamase,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09689v2,2019-04-22 01:17:51+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,A possible solution to the Hubble constant discrepancy -- Cosmology   where the local volume expansion is driven by the domain average density,2019-06-04 05:00:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09689v2
376,"The determination of the speed of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is usually done by tracking brighter features (such as the CME front and core) in visible light coronagraphic images and by deriving unidimensional profiles of the CME speed as a function of altitude or time. Nevertheless, CMEs are usually characterized by the presence of significant density inhomogeneities propagating outward with different radial and latitudinal projected speeds, resulting in a complex evolution eventually forming the Interplanetary CME. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time how coronagraphic image sequences can be analyzed with cross-correlation technique to derive 2D maps of the almost instantaneous plasma speed distribution within the body of CMEs. The technique is first tested with the analysis of synthetic data, and then applied to real observations. Results from this work allow to characterize the distribution and time evolution of kinetic energy inside CMEs, as well as the mechanical energy (combined with the kinetic and potential energy) partition between the core and front of the CME. In the future, CMEs will be observed by two channels (VL and UV Ly-$\alpha$) coronagraphs, such as Metis on-board ESA Solar Orbiter mission as well as Ly-$\alpha$ Solar Telescope (LST) on-board Chinese Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission. Our results will help the analysis of these future observations, helping in particular to take into account the 2D distribution of Ly-$\alpha$ Doppler dimming effect.","Beili Ying, Alessandro Bemporad, Silvio Giordano, Paolo Pagano, Li Feng, Lei Lu, Hui Li, Weiqun Gan",Accepted,1905.11772v2,No journal ref found,Weiqun Gan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11772v2,2019-05-28 12:37:06+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,First Determination of 2D Speed Distribution within the Bodies of   Coronal Mass Ejections with Cross-Correlation Analysis,2019-06-04 04:28:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11772v2
377,"Previous work has demonstrated that at a given stellar mass, quiescent galaxies are more strongly clustered than star-forming galaxies. The contribution to this signal from central, as opposed to satellite, galaxies is not known, which has strong implications for galaxy evolution models. To investigate the contribution from central galaxies, here we present measurements of the clustering of isolated primary (IP) galaxies, used as a proxy for central galaxies, at ${0.2<z<0.9}$ with data from the PRIMUS galaxy redshift survey. Using a sample of spectroscopic redshifts for $\sim60,000$ galaxies with ${M_*\gtrsim10^9~M_\odot}$ covering 5 deg$^2$ on the sky, we define IP galaxies using isolation cuts in spatial proximity and stellar mass of nearby galaxies. We find that at fixed stellar mass, quiescent IP galaxies are more strongly clustered than star-forming IP galaxies at $z\sim0.35$ $(10\sigma)$. Using mock galaxy catalogs based on recent halo occupation models of Behroozi et al. (2018) and designed to replicate the parameters of the PRIMUS survey dataset, we find that these clustering differences are due in part to quiescent central galaxies being more strongly clustered than star-forming central galaxies. This is consistent with either distinct stellar-to-halo mass relations for quiescent and star-forming central galaxies, and/or central galaxy assembly bias. We additionally use mock catalogs to assess the dependence of both incompleteness and satellite galaxy contamination in the IP galaxy samples on redshift, galaxy type, and stellar mass, and demonstrate how isolation criteria yield biased subsamples of central galaxies via {\it environmental incompleteness}, or the preferential exclusion of central galaxies in overdense environments.","Angela M.

378,"An over-dense wake is created by a gravitating object moving through a gaseous medium, and this wake pulls back on the object and slows it down. This is conventional dynamical friction in a gaseous medium. We argue that if the object drives a sufficiently powerful outflow, the wake is destroyed and instead an extended under-dense region is created behind the object. In this case the overall gravitational force is applied in the direction of the object's motion, producing a negative dynamical friction (NDF). Black holes in dense gas drive powerful outflows and may experience the NDF, although extensive numerical work is probably needed to demonstrate or refute this conclusively. NDF may be important for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars inside `common envelopes' in binary systems, for stellar mass black holes inside AGN discs, or for massive black holes growing through super-Eddington accretion in early Universe.","Andrei Gruzinov, Yuri Levin, Christopher D.

379,"In this paper, we investigate the energy function, formation rate and environment of fast radio bursts (FRBs) using Parkes sample and Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) sample. For the first time, the metallicity effect on the formation rate is considered. If FRBs are produced by the mergers of compact binaries, the formation rate of FRBs should have a time delay relative to cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). We get the time delay is about 3-5 Gyr and the index of differential energy function $\gamma$ ($dN/dE\propto E^{-\gamma}$) is between 1.6 and 2.0 from redshift cumulative distribution. The value of $\gamma$ is similar to that of FRB 121102, which indicates single bursts may share the same physical mechanism with the repeaters. In another case, if the formation rate of FRB is proportional to the SFR without time delay, the index $\gamma$ is about 2.3. In both cases, we find that FRBs may prefer to occur in low-metallicity environment with $ 12 +\log(\rm{O/H}) \simeq 8.40$, which is similar to those of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I).","G.

Using recent ALMA observations, we study star formation in the galaxy nucleus and an off-center star-forming clump and measure a median star formation rate (SFR) surface density of $\Sigma^{\mathrm{nucleus}}_{\mathrm{SFR}} = 270\pm54$ and $\Sigma^{\mathrm{sfclump}}_{\mathrm{SFR}} = 170\pm38\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$, respectively. Following the analysis by Sharda et al. (2018), we estimate the molecular gas mass, freefall time and turbulent Mach number in these regions to predict $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ from three star formation relations in the literature. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (Kennicutt 1998, KS) relation, which is based on the gas surface density, underestimates the $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ in these regions by a factor 2-3. The $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ we calculate from the single-freefall model of Krumholz et al. 2012 (KDM) is consistent with the measured $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ in the nucleus and the star-forming clump within the uncertainties. The turbulence-regulated star formation relation by Salim et al. 2015 (SFK) agrees slightly better with the observations than the KDM relation. Our analysis reveals that an interplay between turbulence and gravity can help sustain high SFRs in high-redshift starbursts. It can also be extended to other high- and low-redshift galaxies thanks to the high angular resolution and sensitivity of ALMA observations.","Piyush Sharda, Elisabete da Cunha, Christoph Federrath, Emily Wisnioski, Enrico di Teodoro, Ken-ichi Tadaki, Min Yun, Itziar Aretxaga, Ryohei Kawabe","9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1906.01173v1,No journal ref found,Ryohei Kawabe,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01173v1,2019-06-04 03:00:07+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Testing Star Formation Laws on Spatially Resolved Regions in a $z   \approx 4.3$ Starburst Galaxy,2019-06-04 03:00:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01173v1

383,"PKS B1322-110 is a radio quasar that is located only 8.5' in angular separation from the bright B star Spica. It exhibits intra-day variability in its flux density at GHz frequencies attributed to scintillations from plasma inhomogeneities. We have tracked the rate of scintillation of this source for over a year with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, recording a strong annual cycle that includes a near-standstill in August and another in December. The cycle is consistent with scattering by highly anisotropic plasma microstructure, and we fit our data to that model in order to determine the kinematic parameters of the plasma. Because of the low ecliptic latitude of PKS B1322-110, the orientation of the plasma microstructure is poorly constrained. Nonetheless at each possible orientation our data single out a narrow range of the corresponding velocity component, leading to a one-dimensional constraint in a two-dimensional parameter space. The constrained region is consistent with a published model in which the scattering material is associated with Spica and consists of filaments that are radially oriented around the star.

384,"Sub-Saturns straddle the boundary between gas-rich Jupiters and gas-poor super-Earths/sub-Neptunes. Their large radii (4--8$R_\oplus$) suggest that their gas-to-core mass ratios range $\sim$0.1--1.0. With their envelopes as massive as their cores, sub-Saturns are just on the verge of runaway gas accretion; they are expected to be significantly less populous than gas giants. Yet, the observed occurrence rates of sub-Saturns and Jupiters are comparable within $\sim$100 days. We show that in these inner regions of planetary systems, the growth of sub-Saturns/Jupiters is ultimately limited by local and global hydrodynamic flows---runaway accretion terminates and the formation of gas giants is suppressed. We derive a simple analytic formula for the local hydrodynamic accretion rate---an expression that has been previously reported only as an empirical fit to numerical simulations. Evolving simultaneously the background disk gas and the gas accretion onto planetary cores, we find that both the ubiquity of super-Earths/sub-Neptunes and the rarity of gas-rich planets are best explained if an underlying core mass distribution is peaked at $\sim$4.3$M_\oplus$. Within a finite disk lifetime $\sim$10 Myrs, massive cores ($\gtrsim 10M_\oplus$) can become either gas-poor or gas-rich depending on when they assemble but smaller cores ($\lesssim 10M_\oplus$) can only become gas-poor. This wider range of possible outcomes afforded by more massive cores may explain why metal-rich stars harbor a more diverse set of planets.",Eve J. Lee,"ApJ in press.

386,"We present a sample of galaxies with the Dark Energy Survey (DES) photometry that replicates the properties of the BOSS CMASS sample. The CMASS galaxy sample has been well characterized by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration and was used to obtain the most powerful redshift-space galaxy clustering measurements to date. A joint analysis of redshift-space distortions (such as those probed by CMASS from SDSS) and a galaxy-galaxy lensing measurement for an equivalent sample from DES can provide powerful cosmological constraints. Unfortunately, the DES and SDSS-BOSS footprints have only minimal overlap, primarily on the celestial equator near the SDSS Stripe 82 region. Using this overlap, we build a robust Bayesian model to select CMASS-like galaxies in the remainder of the DES footprint. The newly defined DES-CMASS (DMASS) sample consists of 117,293 effective galaxies covering $1,244 {\rm deg}^2$. Through various validation tests, we show that the DMASS sample selected by this model matches well with the BOSS CMASS sample, specifically in the South Galactic cap (SGC) region that includes Stripe 82. Combining measurements of the angular correlation function and the clustering-z distribution of DMASS, we constrain the difference in mean galaxy bias and mean redshift between the BOSS CMASS and DMASS samples to be $\Delta b = 0.010^{+0.045}_{-0.052}$ and $\Delta z = \left( 3.46^{+5.48}_{-5.55} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ for the SGC portion of CMASS, and $\Delta b = 0.044^{+0.044}_{-0.043} $ and $\Delta z= ( 3.51^{+4.93}_{-5.91}) \times 10^{-3}$ for the full CMASS sample.

387,"Recent observations with ALMA have revealed evidence for non-thermal synchrotron emission from the core regions of two nearby Seyfert galaxies. This suggests that the coronae of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be conducive to the acceleration of non-thermal electrons, in addition to the hot, thermal electrons responsible for their X-ray emission through thermal Comptonization. Here we investigate the mechanism of such particle acceleration, based on observationally inferred parameters for AGN disk coronae. One possibility to account for the observed non-thermal electrons is diffusive shock acceleration, as long as the gyrofactor $\eta_g$ does not exceed $\sim10^6$. These non-thermal electrons can generate gamma rays via inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, which can appear in the MeV band, while those with energies above $\sim100$ MeV would be attenuated via internal $\gamma\gamma$ pair production. The integrated emission from all AGNs with thermal and non-thermal Comptonization can reproduce the observed cosmic background radiation in X-rays as well as gamma-rays up to $\sim 10$ MeV. Furthermore, if protons are accelerated in the same conditions as electrons and $\eta_g\sim30$, our observationally motivated model is also able to account for the diffuse neutrino flux at energies below 100-300 TeV. The next generation of MeV gamma-ray and neutrino facilities can test these expectations by searching for signals from bright, nearby Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151 and IC 4329A.","Yoshiyuki Inoue, Dmitry Khangulyan, Susumu Inoue, Akihiro Doi","24 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1904.00554v2,No journal ref found,Akihiro Doi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00554v2,2019-04-01 04:13:53+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,On high-energy particles in accretion disk coronae of supermassive black   holes: implications for MeV gamma rays and high-energy neutrinos from AGN   cores,2019-06-04 00:12:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00554v2
388,"Inspired by the swampland distance conjecture and the high-slope conjecture, we present two families of multi-field inflationary potentials compatible with the conjectures along the trajectory. One family is a helix-type potential that satisfies the conjectures only locally. This family inflates with $\epsilon_V\gg\epsilon_H$ and produces Planck-compatible scalar perturbations, but a too-high tensor power. Our other family of potentials globally satisfies the swampland conjectures and is in negatively-curved field space. It balances the potential gradient against the geometry to generate high turning rates. Due to the form of the potential, this model has exactly massless entropic perturbations and a light adiabatic mode. In the superhorizon limit, the entropic mode freezes out, which sources linear growth of the adiabatic mode. In contrast to hyperinflation, both families remain under perturbative control.","Vikas Aragam, Sonia Paban, Robert Rosati","27 pages, 5 figures. updated section 4 and appendix B to properly

391,"The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life regulates its environment to be favorable for its own survival. Most planets experience numerous perturbations throughout their lifetimes such as asteroid impacts, volcanism, and the evolution of a star's luminosity. For the Gaia hypothesis to be viable, life must be able to keep the conditions of its host planet habitable, even in the face of these challenges. ExoGaia, a model created to investigate the Gaia hypothesis, has been previously used to demonstrate that a randomly mutating biosphere is in some cases capable of maintaining planetary habitability. However, those model scenarios assumed that all non-biological planetary parameters were static, neglecting the inevitable perturbations that real planets would experience. To see how life responds to climate perturbations to its host planet, we created three climate perturbations in ExoGaia: one rapid cooling of a planet and two heating events, one rapid and one gradual. The planets on which Gaian feedbacks emerge without climate perturbations are the same planets on which life is most likely to survive each of our perturbation scenarios. Biospheres experiencing gradual changes to the environment are able to survive changes of larger magnitude than those experiencing rapid perturbations, and the magnitude of change matters more than the sign. These findings suggest that if the Gaia hypothesis is correct, then typical perturbations that a planet would experience may be unlikely to disrupt it.","Olivia D. N.

One of these pulsates with periods around 4.7 min, making it the shortest period roAp star known to date. Four out of the five new roAp stars are multiperiodic. Three of these, and the singly-periodic one show the presence of rotational mode splitting. Individual frequencies are provided in all cases. In addition, seven previously known roAp stars are analysed. Additional modes of oscillation are found in some stars, while in others we are able to distinguish the true pulsations from possible aliases present in the ground-based data. We find that the pulsation amplitude in the TESS filter is typically a factor 6 smaller than that in the $B$ filter which is usually used for ground-based observations. For four roAp stars we set constraints on the inclination angle and magnetic obliquity, through the application of the oblique pulsator model. We also confirm the absence of roAp-type pulsations down to amplitude limits of 6 and 13 micromag, respectively, in two of the best characterised non-oscillating Ap (noAp) stars. We announce 27 new rotational variables along with their rotation periods, and provide different rotation periods for seven other stars. Finally, we discuss how these results challenge state-of-the-art pulsation models for roAp stars.","M. S. Cunha, V. Antoci, D. L. Holdsworth, D. W. Kurtz, L. A. Balona, Zs. Bognár, D. M. Bowman, Z.

394,"Because of the complex physics that governs the formation of chromospheric lines, interpretation of solar chromospheric observations is difficult. The origin and characteristics of many chromospheric features are, because of this, unresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long fibrils and flare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region which self-consistently reproduces both of them. We model the H$\alpha$, Mg II k, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines using the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code Multi3D.   This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span between the opposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in all lines due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\alpha$, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic field lines are aligned with the H$\alpha$ fibrils, but the latter holds to a lesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line.   The simulation shows structures in the H$\alpha$ line core that look like flare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a dense chromosphere and a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all chromospheric lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. In some pixels, broad asymmetric profiles with a single emission peak are produced, similar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are caused by a deep onset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients.   The simulation produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations. It also produces structures similar to flare ribbons despite the lack of non-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests that thermal conduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the chromosphere in addition to non-thermal electrons.","Johan P.

395,"Wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma is discussed emphasizing the relevance of different inertial frames, notably the plasma rest frame ${\cal K}$ and the pulsar frame ${\cal K}'$ in which the plasma is streaming with speed $\beta_{\rm s}$. The effect of a Lorentz transformation on both subluminal, $|z|<1$, and superluminal, $|z|>1$, waves is discussed. It is argued that the preferred choice for a relativistically streaming distribution should be a Lorentz-transformed J\""uttner distribution; such a distribution is compared with other choices including a relativistically streaming Gaussian distribution. A Lorentz transformation of the dielectric tensor is written down, and used to derive an explicit relation between the relativistic plasma dispersion functions in ${\cal K}$ and ${\cal K}'$. It is shown that the dispersion equation can be written in an invariant form, implying a one-to-one correspondence between wave modes in any two inertial frames. Although there are only three modes in the plasma rest frame, it is possible for backward-propagating or negative-frequency solutions in ${\cal K}$ to transform into additional forward-propagating, positive-frequency solutions in ${\cal K}'$ that may be regarded as additional modes.","M.

398,"We report on a first measurement with a sensitive opto-mechanical force sensor designed for the direct detection of coupling of real chameleons to matter. These dark energy candidates could be produced in the Sun and stream unimpeded to Earth. The KWISP detector installed on the CAST axion search experiment at CERN looks for tiny displacements of a thin membrane caused by the mechanical effect of solar chameleons. The displacements are detected by a Michelson interferometer with a homodyne readout scheme. The sensor benefits from the focusing action of the ABRIXAS X-ray telescope installed at CAST, which increases the chameleon flux on the membrane. A mechanical chopper placed between the telescope output and the detector modulates the incoming chameleon stream. We present the results of the solar chameleon measurements taken at CAST in July 2017, setting an upper bound on the force acting on the membrane of $80$~pN at 95\% confidence level. The detector is sensitive for direct coupling to matter $10^4 \leq\beta_m \leq 10^8$, where the coupling to photons is locally bound to $\beta_\gamma \leq 10^{11}$.","S. Arguedas Cuendis, J.

At high redshift ($z\gtrsim{}4$) the host galaxies of BHBs, NSBHs and DNSs are very similar and are predominantly low-mass galaxies (stellar mass $M<10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). If $z\gtrsim{}4$ most compact objects form and merge in the same galaxy, with a short delay time. At low redshift ($z\leq{}2$), the host galaxy populations of DNSs differ significantly from the host galaxies of both BHBs and NSBHs. DNSs merging at low redshift tend to form and merge in the same galaxy, with relatively short delay time. The stellar mass of DNS hosts peaks around $\sim{}10^{10}-10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. In contrast, BHBs and NSBHs merging at low redshift tend to form in rather small galaxies at high redshift and then to merge in larger galaxies with long delay times.

Recent theoretical studies indicate that some of these systems could ultimately lead to the formation of gravitational waves via black hole binary mergers through the chemically homogeneous evolution pathway. By analyzing ultraviolet-optical phase-resolved spectroscopic data, we aim to constrain atmospheric and wind properties that could be later used to confront theoretical predictions from binary evolution. In particular, surface abundances are powerful diagnostics of the evolutionary status, mass transfer and the internal mixing processes. From a set of 32 VLT/FLAMES visual and 8 HST/COS ultraviolet spectra, we used spectral disentangling to separate the primary and secondary components. Using a genetic algorithm wrapped around the NLTE model atmosphere and spectral synthesis code FASTWIND, we perform an 11-parameter optimization to derive the atmospheric and wind parameters of both components, including the surface abundances of He, C, N, O and Si. We find that both components are hotter than expected compared to single-star evolutionary models indicating that additional mixing processes may be at play. However the derived chemical abundances do not show significant indications of mixing when adopting baseline values typical for the system environment.","Michael Abdul-Masih, Hugues Sana, Jon Sundqvist, Laurent Mahy, Athira Menon, Leonardo A.

The volume of the dataset for each year is just short of 1 TiB. Towards achieving better results in the region classification of active regions and coronal holes, we improve upon the performance of a set of ten image parameters, through an in depth evaluation of various assumptions that are necessary for calculation of these image parameters. Then, where possible, a method for finding an appropriate settings for the parameter calculations was devised, as well as a validation task to show our improved results. In addition, we include comparisons of JP2 and FITS image formats using supervised classification models, by tuning the parameters specific to the format of the images from which they are extracted, and specific to each wavelength. The results of these comparisons show that utilizing JP2 images, which are significantly smaller files, is not detrimental to the region classification task that these parameters were originally intended for. Finally, we compute the tuned parameters on the AIA images and provide a public API (http://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/dmlabapi) to access the dataset.

We use one sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$) ejecta with 1.02 M$_\odot$ and one M$_{\rm Ch}$ ejecta model with 1.40 M$_\odot$. We introduce clumping factors $f=$0.33,0.25, and 0.10 which are constant throughout the ejecta and compared to the unclumped $f=1.0$ case. We find that clumping is a natural mechanism to reduce the ionization of the ejecta, reducing emission from [Fe III], [Ar III], and [S III] by a factor of a few. For decreasing values of the clumping factor $f$, the [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet became a dominant cooling line for our M$_{\rm Ch}$ model but still weak in our sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ model. Strong [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 indicates non-thermal heating in that region and may constrain explosion modelling.

406,"A challenging requirement posed by next-generation observations is a firm theoretical grasp of the impact of baryons on structure formation. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations modeling gas physics are vital in this regard. A high degree of modeling flexibility exists in this space making it important to explore a range of methods in order to gauge the accuracy of simulation predictions. We present results from the first cosmological simulation using Conservative Reproducing Kernel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (CRK-SPH). We employ two simulations: one evolved purely under gravity and the other with non-radiative hydrodynamics. Each contains 2x2304^3 cold dark matter plus baryon particles in an 800 Mpc/h box. We compare statistics to previous non-radiative simulations including power spectra, mass functions, baryon fractions, and concentration. We find self-similar radial profiles of gas temperature, entropy, and pressure and show that a simple analytic model recovers these results to better than 40% over two orders of magnitude in mass. We quantify the level of non-thermal pressure support in halos and demonstrate that hydrostatic mass estimates are biased low by 24% (10%) for halos of mass 10^15 (10^13) Msun/h. We compute angular power spectra for the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and find good agreement with the low-l Planck measurements. Finally, artificial scattering between particles of unequal mass is shown to have a large impact on the gravity-only run and we highlight the importance of better understanding this issue in hydrodynamic applications.

407,"We measure the bulk system parameters of the seismically active, rapidly-rotating $\delta$-Scuti KOI-976 and constrain the orbit geometry of its transiting binary companion using a combined approach of asteroseismology and gravity-darkening light curve analysis. KOI-976 is a $1.62\pm0.2~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ star with a measured $v\sin(i)$ of $120\pm2$ km/s and seismically-induced variable signal that varies by $\sim$ 0.6\% of the star's total photometric brightness. We take advantage of the star's oblate shape and seismic activity to perform three measurements of its obliquity angle relative to the plane of the sky. We first apply rotational splitting theory to the star's variable signal observed in short-cadence \emph{Kepler} photometry to constrain KOI-976's obliquity angle, and then subtract off variability from that dataset using the linear algorithm for significance reduction software {\tt LASR}. We perform gravity-darkened fits to \emph{Kepler} variability-subtracted short-cadence photometry and to \emph{Kepler's} phase-folded long-cadence photometry to obtain two more measurements of the star's obliquity. We find that the binary system transits in a grazing configuration with measured obliquity values of $36^\circ\pm17^\circ$, $46^\circ\pm16^\circ$, and $43^\circ\pm20^\circ$ respectively for the three measurements. We perform these analyses as a way to demonstrate overcoming the challenges high-mass stars can present to transit light curve fitting and to prepare for the large number of exoplanets \emph{TESS} will discover orbiting A/F stars.","John P.

408,"NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker) spacecraft reached its first perihelion of 35.7 solar radii on November 5th, 2018. To aid in mission planning, and in anticipation of the unprecedented measurements to be returned, in late October, we developed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solution for the solar corona and inner heliosphere, driven by the then available observations of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field. Our model incorporates a wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) model to heat the corona. Here, we present our predictions for the structure of the solar corona and the likely {\it in situ} measurements that Parker will be returning over the next few months. We infer that, in the days prior to 1st Encounter, Parker was immersed in wind emanating from a positive-polarity equatorial coronal hole. During the encounter, however, field lines from the spacecraft mapped to another, negative-polarity equatorial coronal hole. Following the encounter, Parker was magnetically connected to the large, positive-polarity northern polar coronal hole. When the Parker data become available, these model results can be used to assist in their calibration and interpretation, and, additionally, provide a global context for interpreting the localized {\it in situ} measurements. In particular, we can identify what types of solar wind Parker encountered, what the underlying magnetic structure was, and how complexities in the orbital trajectory can be interpreted within a global, inertial frame. Ultimately, the measurements returned by Parker can be used to constrain current theories for heating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind.","Pete Riley, Cooper Downs, Jon A.

409,"Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful probe of cosmology and of the dark universe. This cosmic shear technique relies on the accurate measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background galaxies and requires precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) is a forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match the target data statistically, followed by calibrations and tolerance loops. We present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the shear power spectrum $C_{\ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the background galaxy sample. The method includes maps of the systematic sources, Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and the fast estimation of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical agreement between the simulations and the DES Y1 data using an array of diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_\ell$ and $n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the systematic uncertainty. Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination of $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$, defined as $S_8D_{\rm{IA}} = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{\rm{IA}}$, where $D_{\rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{\rm{IA}}-1)$. We find $S_8D_{\rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$, where systematics are at the level of roughly 60\% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results in the context of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that this method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear measurements with future wide-field surveys.","T. Kacprzak, J. Herbel, A. Nicola, R. Sgier, F.

410,"Herbig-Haro (HH) flows exhibit a large variety of morphological and kinematical structures such as bow shocks, Mach disks, and deflection shocks. Both proper motion (PM) and radial velocity investigations are essential to understand the physical nature of such structures. We investigate the kinematics and PM of spectrally separated structures in the FS~Tau~B HH flow. Collating these data makes it possible to understand the origin of these structures and to explain the unusual behavior of the jet. On the other hand, the study of emission profiles in the associated reflection nebulae allows us to consider the source of the outflow both from edge-on and pole-on points of view. We present the observational results obtained with the 6 m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using the SCORPIO multimode focal reducer with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the FS~Tau~B region in H$\alpha$ emission (2001 and 2012) allowed us to measure the PM of the spectrally separated inner structures of the jet. In addition to already known emission structures in the FS~Tau~B system, we discover new features in the extended part of the jet and in the counter-jet. Moreover, we reveal a new HH knot in the HH~276 independent outflow system and point out its presumable source. In the terminal working surface of the jet, structures with different radial velocities have PMs of the same value. This result can be interpreted as the direct observation of bow-shock and Mach disk regions. A bar-like structure, located southwest from the source demonstrates zero PM and can be considered as one more example of deflection shock. An analysis of H$\alpha$ profiles in the reflection nebulae R1 and R3 indicates the uniqueness of this object, which can be studied in pole-on and edge-on directions simultaneously.","T. A.

411,"We analyse the CO-dark molecular gas content of simulated molecular clouds from the SILCC-Zoom project. The simulations reach a resolution of 0.1 pc and include H$_2$ and CO formation, radiative stellar feedback and magnetic fields. CO-dark gas is found in regions with local visual extinctions $A_\text{V, 3D} \sim$ 0.2 -- 1.5, number densities of 3 -- 300 cm$^{-3}$ and gas temperatures of few 10 K -- 100 K. CO-bright gas is found at number densities above 300 cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures below 50 K. The CO-dark gas fractions range from 40% to 95% and scale inversely with the amount of well-shielded gas ($A_\text{V, 3D}$ $\gtrsim$ 1.5), which is smaller in magnetised molecular clouds. We show that the density, chemical abundances and $A_\text{V, 3D}$ along a given line-of-sight cannot be properly determined from projected quantities. As an example, we show that pixels with a projected visual extinction of $A_\text{V, 2D} \simeq$ 2.5 -- 5 can be both, CO-bright and CO-dark. By producing synthetic CO(1-0) emission maps of the simulations with RADMC-3D, we show that about 15 -- 65% of the H$_2$ is in regions with CO(1-0) emission below the detection limit. The simulated clouds have $X_\text{CO}$-factors around 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ with a spread of up to a factor $\sim$ 4, implying a similar uncertainty in the derived total H$_2$ masses and even worse results for individual pixels. Based on our results, we suggest a new approach to determine the H$_2$ mass, which relies on the availability of CO(1-0) emission and $A_\text{V, 2D}$ maps. It reduces the uncertainty of the clouds' overall H$_2$ mass to a factor of $\lesssim$ 1.8 and for individual pixels, i.e. on sub-pc scales, to a factor of $\lesssim$ 3.","D. Seifried, S. Haid, S.

412,"Possible existence of extragalactic ultra-high energy cosmic ray sources giving a very small particle flux on the Earth is considered. Accretion discs around supermassive black holes where particles are accelerated in electric fields are discussed as an illustration of such sources. Due to acceleration mechanism particle injection spectra are assumed to be hard. In this case particle flux on the Earth is too low for detection. But particles produce in space a noticeable flux of diffuse gamma-ray emission via electromagnetic cascades. It should be accounted for when analyzing other source models and dark matter models. Also neutrinos are produced in cascades, and at energies E >10^19 eV cascade neutrino spectra depends on injection spectra. Therefore it is proposed to study cosmic ray sources under consideration using data on gamma-ray and neutrino emission.",A. Uryson,"8 pages, 2 figures",1906.01014v1,No journal ref found,A.

413,"We investigate the impact of dynamical streams and substructure on estimates of the local escape speed and total mass of Milky Way-mass galaxies from modelling the high velocity tail of local halo stars. We use a suite of high-resolution, magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, which resolve phase space substructure in local volumes around solar-like positions. We show that phase space structure varies significantly between positions in individual galaxies and across the suite. Substructure populates the high velocity tail unevenly and leads to discrepancies in the mass estimates. We show that a combination of streams, sample noise and truncation of the high velocity tail below the escape speed leads to a distribution of mass estimates with a median that falls below the true value by $\sim 20 \%$, and a spread of a factor of 2 across the suite. Correcting for these biases, we derive a revised value for the Milky Way mass presented in Deason et al. of $1.29 ^{+0.37}_{-0.47} \times 10^{12}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$.","Robert J. J. Grand, Alis J.

Our final BSS sample consists of 22 objects, spanning the whole color and magnitude extension of the BSS sequence in 47 Tucanae. We fitted the BSS broadband SEDs with models to derive temperature, surface gravity, radius, luminosity and mass. We show that BSSs indeed define a mass sequence, where the mass increases for increasing luminosity. Interestingly, the BSS masses estimates from the SED fitting turn out to be comparable to those derived from the projection of the stellar position in the color-magnitude diagram onto standard star evolutionary tracks. We compare our results with previous, direct mass estimates of a few BSSs in 47 Tucanae.

These models result in a non-singular bounce as in loop quantum cosmology, but with far more complex modified Friedmann dynamics with higher order than quadratic terms in energy density. For the kinetic energy dominated bounce, we obtain analytical solutions using different approximations and compare with numerical evolution for various physical variables. The relative error turns out to be less than 0.3% in the bounce regime for both of the potentials. Generic features of dynamics, shared with loop quantum cosmology, are established using analytical and numerical solutions. Detailed properties of three distinct phases in dynamics separating bounce regime, transition stage and inflationary phase are studied.

416,"Previous estimates of the annual mean surface temperature of Jupiter's moon, Europa, neglected the effect of the eccentricity of Jupiter's orbit around the Sun, the effect of the emissivity and heat capacity of Europa's ice, the effect of the eclipse of Europa (i.e., the relative time that Europa is within the shadow of Jupiter), the effect of Jupiter's radiation, and the effect of Europa's internal heating. Other studies concentrated on the diurnal cycle but neglected some of the above factors. In addition, to our knowledge, the seasonal cycle of the surface temperature of Europa was not estimated. Here we systematically estimate the diurnal, seasonal and annual mean surface temperature of Europa, when Europa's obliquity, emissivity, heat capacity, and eclipse, as well as Jupiter's radiation, internal heating, and eccentricity, are all taken into account. For a typical internal heating rate of 0.05 W m$^{-2}$, the equator, pole, and the global and mean annual mean surface temperatures are 96K, 46K, and 90K, respectively. We found that the temperature at the high latitudes is significantly affected by the internal heating, especially during the winter solstice, suggesting that measurements of high latitude surface temperatures can be used to constrain the internal heating.

417,"We study the power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations in the framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) up to three loop orders. In principle, several counter-terms may be needed to handle the short-distance sensitivity in perturbation theory. However, we show that a small number of extra coefficients are sufficient to match numerical simulations with percent accuracy when a generic renormalization prescription is implemented (allowing for running of the individual counter-terms). We show that the level of accuracy increases with respect to the two loop results, up to $k \simeq 0.4\, h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$, although the overall improvement is somewhat marginal. At the same time, we argue there is evidence that the behavior of the loop expansion in the EFTofLSS is typical of an asymptotic series, already on the brink of its maximum predictive power (at $z=0$). Hence, the inclusion of higher orders will likely deteriorate the matching to data, even at moderate values of $k$. Part of the reason for this behavior is due to large contributions to the (renormalized) power spectrum at three loop order from mildly non-linear scales, even after the UV counter-terms are included. In conclusion, the EFTofLSS to three loop orders provides the best approximation to the (deterministic part of the) power spectrum in the weakly non-linear regime at $z=0$, and higher loops are not expected to improve our level of accuracy.","Thomas Konstandin, Rafael A.

418,"We present a novel approach aimed at identifying the key chemical elements to search for the (missing) descendants of very massive first stars exploding as Pair Instability Supernovae (PISN). Our simple and general method consists in a parametric study accounting for the unknowns related to early cosmic star-formation and metal-enrichment. Our approach allow us to define the most likely [Fe/H] and abundance ratios of long-lived stars born in inter-stellar media polluted by the nucleosynthetic products of PISN at a > 90%, 70%, and 50% level. In agreement with previous works, we show that the descendants of very massive first stars can be most likely found at [Fe/H]~ -2. Further, we demonstrate that to search for an under-abundance of [(N, Cu, Zn)/Fe] < 0 is the key to identify these rare descendants. The ""killing elements"" N, Zn, and Cu are not produced by PISN, so that their sub-Solar abundance with respect to iron persists in environments polluted by further generations of normal core-collapse supernovae up to a 50% level. We show that the star BD +80 245, which has [Fe/H]= -2.2, [N/Fe]= -0.79, [Cu/Fe]=-0.75, and [Zn/Fe]= -0.12 can be the smoking gun of the chemical imprint from very massive first stars. To this end we acquired new spectra for BD +80 245 and re-analysed those available from the literature accounting for Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium corrections for Cu. We discuss how to find more of these missing descendants in ongoing and future surveys to tightly constrain the mass distribution of the first stars.","S. Salvadori, P. Bonifacio, E. Caffau, S.

The CO(1-0) line emission is observed across $\sim18\,$kpc scales with a resolution of $\sim 1\,\rm kpc$. About 78\% of the CO(1-0) luminosity traces a galaxy-size rotating disk. However, after subtracting the emission due to such rotating disk, we detect with a S/N=20 a residual emission in the central $\sim 4\,$kpc. Such residuals may trace a low velocity ($v_{max}=170\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) outflow. We compare the momentum rate and kinetic power of such putative molecular outflow with that of the X-ray UFO and find that its energetics would be consistent with a momentum-driven blast-wave feedback model with $\dot{P}_{out}/\dot{P}_{UFO}=0.3\pm0.2$. This result is at odds with the energy-conserving scenario suggested by the momentum-boosted massive molecular outflows detected in some local ULIRGs. An alternative interpretation of the residual CO emission would be a compact rotating structure, distinct from the main disk, which would be a factor of $\sim10-100$ more extended and massive than typical circumnuclear disks revealed in Seyferts. However, in both scenarios, our results rule out the hypothesis of a momentum-boosted molecular outflow in this AGN, despite the presence of a powerful X-ray UFO.

We provide analytic arguments and simulations in spherical approximation, that need to be validated by more comprehensive simulations. The above result can be important for fundamental physics, because core-collapse supernova explosions seem anthropically needed, as they spread intermediate-mass nuclei presumably necessary for `life'.

ERQs on average have [OIII] outflows velocities about 3 times larger than those of luminosity-matched blue quasar samples. We show that the faster [OIII] outflows in ERQs are strongly correlated with their extreme red colors and not with radio-loudness, larger quasar luminosities, nor higher Eddington ratios. We estimate for these objects that at least 3-5 per cent of their bolometric luminosity is being converted into the kinetic power of the observed wind.

423,"Using high-cadence observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility at low Galactic latitudes, we have discovered a new class of pulsating, hot, compact stars. We have found four candidates, exhibiting blue colors ($g-r\leq-0.1$ mag), pulsation amplitudes of $>5\%$, and pulsation periods of $200 - 475$ sec. Fourier transforms of the lightcurves show only one dominant frequency. Phase-resolved spectroscopy for three objects reveals significant radial velocity, T$_{\rm eff}$ and log(g) variations over the pulsation cycle, consistent with large amplitude radial oscillations. The mean T$_{\rm eff}$ and log(g) for these stars are consistent with hot subdwarf B (sdB) effective temperatures and surface gravities. We calculate evolutionary tracks using MESA and adiabatic pulsations using GYRE for low-mass helium-core pre-white dwarfs and low mass helium-burning stars. Comparison of low-order radial oscillation mode periods with the observed pulsation periods show better agreement with the pre-white dwarf models. Therefore, we suggest that these new pulsators and Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) could be members of the same class of pulsators, composed of young $\approx0.25-0.35$ M$_\odot$ helium-core pre-white dwarfs.","Thomas Kupfer, Evan B.

424,"The recently discovered discrepancy between galaxy mass measurements from weak lensing and predictions from abundance matching questions our understanding of cosmology, or of the galaxy-halo connection, or of both. We re-examined this tension by considering, as models, different cosmological simulations in the Illustris suite. We produced excess profiles $R\Delta\Sigma$ from subhalo snapshots at different redshifts in Illustris-1 and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG300) simulations, enabling a direct comparison with weak-lensing measurements. We separate the individual contributions of stars, dark matter and gas within $\approx1$ Mpc (comoving length), beyond which correlated two-halo terms dominate. The mismatch between measurements and predictions is more severe than in previous studies: $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles from IllustrisTNG are $\approx2$ times higher than the measured ones. Contrary to abundance matching results, the mismatch is mostly unchanged with increasing redshifts. The contribution of gas to the $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles is $5-10\%$ over the scales dominated by one-halo terms. Different procedures to link stellar and halo masses (abundance matching, cosmological simulations) are still significantly discrepant with weak lensing measurements, but their trends are different. Therefore, the change in cosmological parameters advocated through abundance-matching arguments may not resolve this tension. Also, current criteria to select isolated massive galaxies in simulations are susceptible to resolution issues and may not correspond to observational criteria. The (currently subdominant) contribution of gas is non-negligible, and even if the major discrepancy within stellar and halo masses is resolved, it will be an appreciable source of systematics in the LSST era, when uncertainties on the $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles are expected to be $\approx10$ times smaller.","Jacob Svensmark, Davide Martizzi, Adriano Agnello",Submitted to A&A,1906.00975v1,No journal ref found,Adriano Agnello,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00975v1,2019-06-03 18:00:02+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,On the mass mismatch between simulations and weak-lensing measurements,2019-06-03 18:00:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00975v1

426,"We report the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the metal rich host galaxy of superluminous supernova (SLSN) PTF10tpz, a barred spiral galaxy at z=0.03994. We find the CO(1-0) emission to be confined within the bar of the galaxy. The distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the host galaxy resemble gas flows along two lanes running from the tips of the bar towards the galaxy center. These gas lanes end in a gaseous structure in the inner region of the galaxy, likely associated with an inner Lindblad resonance. The interaction between the large-scale gas flows in the bar and the gas in the inner region plausibly leads to the formation of massive molecular clouds and consequently massive clusters. This in turn can result in formation of massive stars, and thus the likely progenitor of the SLSN in a young, massive cluster. This picture is consistent with SLSN PTF10tpz being located near the inner structure. We find the molecular gas in the vicinity of the SLSN to have high surface densities, comparable with those in interacting galaxies or starburst regions in nearby galaxies. This lends support to high densities being favorable conditions for formation of SLSNe progenitors.","M. Arabsalmani, S. Roychowdhury, F. Renaud, D. Cormier, E. Le Floc'h, E. Emsellem, D. A.

427,"We report the discovery with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) of narrow emission and absorption lines during photospheric radius expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact binary 4U 1820-30. NICER observed the source in 2017 August accumulating about 60 ks of exposure. Five thermonuclear X-ray bursts were detected of which four showed clear signs of PRE. We extracted spectra during the PRE phases and fit each to a model that includes a comptonized component to describe the accretion-driven emission, and a black body for the burst thermal radiation. The temperature and spherical emitting radius of the fitted black body are used to assess the strength of PRE in each burst. The two strongest PRE bursts (burst pair 1) had black body temperatures of approximately 0.6 keV and emitting radii of 100 km (at a distance of 8.4 kpc). The other two bursts (burst pair 2) had higher temperatures (~0.67 keV) and smaller radii (75 km). All of the PRE bursts show evidence of narrow line emission near 1 keV. By co-adding the PRE phase spectra of burst pairs 1 and, separately, 2 we find, in both co-added spectra, significant, narrow, spectral features near 1.0 (emission), 1.7 and 3.0 keV (both in absorption). Remarkably, all the fitted line centroids in the co-added spectrum of burst pair 1 appear systematically blue-shifted by a factor of $1.046 \pm 0.006$ compared to the centroids of pair 2, strongly indicative of a gravitational red-shift, a wind-induced blue-shift, or more likely some combination of both effects. The observed shifts are consistent with this scenario in that the stronger PRE bursts in pair 1 reach larger photospheric radii, and thus have weaker gravitational red-shifts, and they generate faster outflows, yielding higher blue-shifts. We discuss possible elemental identifications for the observed features in the context of recent burst-driven wind models.","T. E. Strohmayer, D. Altamirano, Z. Arzoumanian, P. M. Bult, D.

428,"The detection of transiting exoplanets in time-series photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. Due to vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99% and 94% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator.

429,Ultracompact dark matter (DM) minihalos at masses at and below $10^{-12}$ $M_\odot$ arise in axion DM models where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is broken after inflation. The minihalos arise from density perturbations that are generated from the non-trivial axion self interactions during and shortly after the collapse of the axion-string and domain-wall network. We perform high-resolution simulations of this scenario starting at the epoch before the PQ phase transition and ending at matter-radiation equality. We characterize the spectrum of primordial perturbations that are generated and comment on implications for efforts to detect axion DM. We also measure the DM density at different simulated masses and argue that the correct DM density is obtained for $m_a = 25.2 \pm 11.0$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}$.,"Malte Buschmann, Joshua W.

430,"Upcoming weak lensing surveys require a detailed theoretical understanding of the matter power spectrum in order to derive accurate and precise cosmological parameter values. While galaxy formation is known to play an important role, its precise effects are currently unknown. We present a set of 92 matter power spectra from the OWLS, cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS simulation suites, including different $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, neutrino masses, subgrid prescriptions and AGN feedback strengths. We conduct a detailed investigation of the dependence of the relative difference between the total matter power spectra in hydrodynamical and collisionless simulations on the effectiveness of stellar and AGN feedback, cosmology and redshift. The strength of AGN feedback can greatly affect the power on a range of scales, while a lack of stellar feedback can greatly increase the effectiveness of AGN feedback on large scales. We also examine differences in the initial conditions of hydrodynamic and N-body simulations that can lead to a ~1% discrepancy in the large-scale power, and furthermore show our results to be insensitive to cosmic variance. We present an empirical model capable of predicting the effect of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum at z=0 to within 1% for k<1 h/Mpc, given only the mean baryon fraction in galaxy groups. Differences in group baryon fractions can also explain the quantitative disagreement between predictions from the literature.

431,"Very light dark matter is usually taken to consist of uncharged bosons such as axion-like particles or dark photons. Here, we consider the prospect of very light, possibly even sub-eV dark matter carrying a net charge that is (approximately) conserved. By making use of the Affleck-Dine mechanism for its production, we show that a sizable fraction of the energy density can be stored in the asymmetric component. We furthermore argue that there exist regions of parameter space where the energy density contained in symmetric particle-antiparticle pairs without net charge can to some degree be depleted by considering couplings to additional fields. Finally, we make an initial foray into the phenomenology of this scenario by considering the possibility that dark matter is coupled to the visible sector via the Higgs portal.","Gonzalo Alonso-Álvarez, Julia Gehrlein, Joerg Jaeckel, Sebastian Schenk","24 pages + appendices, 4 figures",1906.00969v1,No journal ref found,Sebastian Schenk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00969v1,2019-06-03 18:00:00+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Very Light Asymmetric Dark Matter,2019-06-03 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00969v1
432,"Using almost one million galaxies from the final Data Release 12 of the SDSS's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we have obtained, albeit with low significance, a first model-independent determination of the radial BAO peak with 9% error: $\Delta z_{\rm BAO}(z_{\rm eff}=0.51)= 0.0456 \pm 0.0042$. In order to obtain this measurement, the radial correlation function was computed in 7,700 angular pixels, from which mean correlation function and covariance matrix were obtained, making the analysis completely model independent. This novel method of obtaining the covariance matrix was validated via the comparison with 500 BOSS mock catalogs. This $\Delta z_{\rm BAO}$ determination can be used to constrain the background expansion of exotic models for which the assumptions adopted in the standard analysis cannot be satisfied. Future galaxy catalogs from J-PAS, DESI and Euclid are expected to significantly increase the quality and significance of model-independent determinations of the BAO peak, possibly determined at various redshift and angular positions. We stress that it is imperative to test the standard paradigm in a model-independent way in order to test its foundations, maximize the extraction of information from the data, and look for clues regarding the poorly understood dark energy and dark matter.","Valerio Marra, Eddy G.

433,"We investigate the fundamental plane (FP) evolution of early-type galaxies in the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation (TNG100) from redshift $z=0$ to $z=2$. We find that a tight plane relation already exists as early as $z=2$. Its scatter stays as low as $\sim 0.08$ dex across this redshift range. Both slope parameters $b$ and $c$ (where $R \propto \sigma^b I^c$ with $R$, $\sigma$, and $I$ being the typical size, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness) of the plane evolve mildly since $z=2$, roughly consistent with observations. The FP residual $\rm Res$ ($\equiv\,a\,+\,b\log \sigma\,+\,c\log I\,-\,\log R$, where $a$ is the zero point of the FP) is found to strongly correlate with stellar age, indicating that stellar age can be used as a crucial fourth parameter of the FP. However, we find that $4c+b+2=\delta$, where $\delta \sim 0.8$ for FPs in TNG, rather than zero as is typically inferred from observations. This implies that a tight power-law relation between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio $M_{\rm dyn}/L$ and the dynamical mass $M_{\rm dyn}$ (where $M_{\rm dyn}\equiv 5\sigma^2R/G$, with $G$ being the gravitational constant) is not present in the TNG100 simulation. Recovering such a relation requires proper mixing between dark matter and baryons, as well as star formation occurring with correct efficiencies at the right mass scales. This represents a powerful constraint on the numerical models, which has to be satisfied in future hydrodynamical simulations.","Shengdong Lu, Dandan Xu, Yunchong Wang, Shude Mao, Junqiang Ge, Volker Springel, Yuan Wang, Mark Vogelsberger, Naiman Jill, Lars Hernquist","9 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, Submitted to MNRAS",1906.00927v1,No journal ref found,Lars Hernquist,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00927v1,2019-06-03 17:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Redshift Evolution of the Fundamental Plane Relation in the IllustrisTNG   Simulation,2019-06-03 17:00:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00927v1
434,"To obtain gravitational waveforms, results of analytical approximations for the early phase of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are `stitched' with --or calibrated against-- numerical simulations for the late phase. Each of these calculations requires external inputs and there are additional ambiguities associated with the stitching procedure. Nonetheless, the resulting waveforms have been invaluable for the initial detections by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. We are now entering an era of abundant detections, requiring greater theoretical precision both for testing general relativity and for estimating source parameters assuming general relativity (GR). The goal of this paper is to show that full non-linear GR imposes an infinite number of sharp constraints on the CBC waveforms which can be used as clear-cut measures (i) to evaluate the accuracy of any waveform in the template bank against exact GR, and (ii) to discriminate between various choices that have to be made to resolve the ambiguities.","Abhay Ashtekar, Tommaso De Lorenzo, Neev Khera","23 pages, 1 figure",1906.00913v1,No journal ref found,Neev Khera,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00913v1,2019-06-03 16:29:34+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE,Compact binary coalescences: Constraints on waveforms,2019-06-03 16:29:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00913v1

The aim of the present study is to provide accurate spectroscopic parameters for the most abundant minor isotopolog CH$_3$$^{34}$SH to support radio astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The rotational spectrum of CH$_3$$^{34}$SH, which is complicated by the large-amplitude internal rotation of the CH$_3$ group versus the $^{34}$SH frame, was investigated in the 49$-$510 GHz and 1.1$-$1.5 THz frequency ranges in natural isotopic abundance. The analysis of the spectrum was performed up to the second excited torsional state, and the obtained data were modeled with the RAM36 program. A fit within experimental accuracy was obtained with a RAM Hamiltonian model that uses 72 parameters. Predictions based on this fit are used to search for CH$_3$$^{34}$SH with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2), but blends with emission lines of other species prevent its firm identification in this source.","Olena Zakharenko, Frank Lewen, Vadim V.

436,"The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to $\sim$30\% less false transit signatures at $7.1\sigma$. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives.","V.

437,"Given the compositional diversity of asteroids, and their distribution in space, it is impossible to consider returning samples from each one to establish their origin. However, the velocity and molecular composition of primary minerals, hydrated silicates, and organic materials can be determined by in situ dust detector instruments. Such instruments could sample the cloud of micrometer-scale particles shed by asteroids to provide direct links to known meteorite groups without returning the samples to terrestrial laboratories. We extend models of the measured lunar dust cloud from LADEE to show that the abundance of detectable impact-generated microsamples around asteroids is a function of the parent body radius, heliocentric distance, flyby distance, and speed. We use monte carlo modeling to show that several tens to hundreds of particles, if randomly ejected and detected during a flyby, would be a sufficient number to classify the parent body as an ordinary chondrite, basaltic achondrite, or other class of meteorite. Encountering and measuring microsamples shed from near-earth and main-belt asteroids, coupled with complementary imaging and multispectral measurements, could accomplish a thorough characterization of small, airless bodies.","Barbara A.

438,"The presence of a bright ""photon ring"" surrounding a dark ""black hole shadow"" has been discussed as an important feature of the observational appearance of emission originating near a black hole. We clarify the meaning and relevance of these heuristics with analytic calculations and numerical toy models. The standard usage of the term ""shadow"" describes the appearance of a black hole illuminated from all directions, including from behind the observer. A backlit black hole casts a somewhat larger shadow. Neither shadow heuristic is particularly relevant to understanding the appearance of emission originating near the black hole, where the emission profile and gravitational redshift play the dominant roles in determining the observed size of the central dark area. A photon ring results from light rays that orbit near the black hole before escaping to infinity, where they arrive near a ring-shaped ""critical curve"" on the image plane. Although the brightness can become arbitrarily large near this critical curve in the case of optically thin emitting matter, we show that the enhancement is only logarithmic, and hence is of no relevance to present observations. For optically thin emission from a geometrically thin or thick disk, photons that make only a fraction of an orbit will generically give rise to a much wider ""lensing ring,"" which is a demagnified image of the back of the disk, superimposed on top of the direct emission. The lensing ring is centered at a radius ~5% larger than the photon ring and its width is ~0.5-1M. It can be relatively brighter by a factor of 2-3 and thus could provide a significant feature in high resolution images. Nevertheless, the characteristic features of the observed image are dominated by the location and properties of the emitting matter near the black hole.

439,"Rotation measure synthesis allows the estimation of Faraday dispersion via a Fourier transform and is the primary tool to probe cosmic magnetic fields. We show this can be considered mathematically equivalent to the one dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in a different Fourier space. As a result, familiar concepts in two dimensional intensity interferometry designed to correctly account for a range of instrumental conditions can be translated to the analysis of Faraday dispersion. In particular, we show how to model the effect of channel averaging during Faraday reconstruction, which has to date limited the progress of polarimetic science using wide-band measurements. Further, we simulate 1d sparse reconstruction with channel averaging for realistic frequency coverages, and show that it is possible to recover signals with large rotation measure values that were previously excluded from possible detection. This is especially important for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extended these ideas to introduce mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work, thus provides the first framework for correctly undertaking wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the provision to add data from multiple telescopes, a prospect that should vastly improve the quality and quantity of polarimetric science. This is of particular importance for extreme environments which generate high magnetic fields such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will allow such sources to be accurately used as probes of cosmological fields.","Luke Pratley, Melanie Johnston-Hollitt","16 Pages, 13 Figures.

440,"We present our results from training and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict galaxy shapes from wide-field survey images of the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR1). We use conventional shape measurements as ground truth from an overlapping, deeper survey with less sky coverage, the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We demonstrate that CNN predictions from single band DES images reproduce the results of CFHTLenS at bright magnitudes and show higher correlation with CFHTLenS at fainter magnitudes than maximum likelihood model fitting estimates in the DES Y1 im3shape catalogue. Prediction of shape parameters with a CNN is also extremely fast, it takes only 0.2 milliseconds per galaxy, improving more than 4 orders of magnitudes over forward model fitting. The CNN can also accurately predict shapes when using multiple images of the same galaxy, even in different color bands, with no additional computational overhead. The CNN is again more precise for faint objects, and the advantage of the CNN is more pronounced for blue galaxies than red ones when compared to the DES Y1 metacalibration catalogue, which fits a single Gaussian profile using riz band images. We demonstrate that CNN shape predictions within the metacalibration self-calibrating framework yield shear estimates with negligible multiplicative bias, $ m < 10^{-3}$, and no significant PSF leakage. Our proposed setup is applicable to current and next generation weak lensing surveys where higher quality ground truth shapes can be measured in dedicated deep fields.","Dezső Ribli, László Dobos, István Csabai",No comment found,1902.08161v2,No journal ref found,István Csabai,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08161v2,2019-02-21 17:51:28+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Galaxy shape measurement with convolutional neural networks,2019-06-03 15:13:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08161v2
441,"Strongly lensed supernovae can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of supernovae (Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed supernovae. Supernova samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed supernovae detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged supernova still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed supernovae found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification.   We find that the ZTF will find about 2 type Ia and 4 core-collapse lensed supernovae per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed supernovae per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed supernovae will be dominated by type IIn supernovae contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of supernovae. Revisiting the case of the lensed supernova iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2\sigma contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the iPTF survey.","Radosław Wojtak, Jens Hjorth, Christa Gall","16 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS",1903.07687v2,No journal ref found,Christa Gall,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07687v2,2019-03-18 19:31:49+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Magnified or multiply imaged? - Search strategies for gravitationally   lensed supernovae in wide-field surveys,2019-06-03 14:45:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07687v2
442,"We observe the abrupt end of solar activity cycles at the Sun's equator by combining almost 140 years of observations from ground and space. These ""terminator"" events appear to be very closely related to the onset of magnetic activity belonging to the next sunspot cycle at mid-latitudes and the polar-reversal process at high-latitudes. Using multi-scale tracers of solar activity we examine the timing of these events in relation to the excitation of new activity and find that the time taken for the solar plasma to communicate this transition is of the order of one solar rotation, but could be shorter. Utilizing uniquely comprehensive solar observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) we see that this transitional event is strongly longitudinal in nature. Combined, these characteristics imply that magnetic information is communicated through the solar interior rapidly. A range of possibilities exist to explain such behavior: the presence of magnetic reconnection in the deep interior, internal gravity waves on the solar tachocline, or that the magnetic fields present in the Sun's convection zone could be very large, with a poloidal field strengths reaching 50k - considerably larger than conventional explorations of solar and stellar dynamos estimate. Regardless of mechanism responsible, the rapid timescales demonstrated by the Sun's global magnetic field reconfiguration present strong constraints on first-principles numerical simulations of the solar interior and, by extension, other stars.","Scott W.

443,"The phase state in the intermediate density range of dense matter ($\sim1-10$ times of nuclear saturation density) is both intriguing and unclear, and could have important observable effects in the present gravitational wave era of neutron stars. Since the matter density in neutron stars is in the nonperturbative interaction region, the sound velocity is expected to approach the conformal limit ($c_s/c=1/\sqrt{3}$) at high densities, and it should also fulfill the causality limit ($c_s/c<1$). However, its detailed behavior remains a hot topic of debate. We explore the general properties of the sound velocity and the adiabatic index in hybrid stars, as well as in neutron stars and quark stars. For this purpose, the bag model, the perturbation model, the equivparticle model, and the quasiparticle model are employed for the quark phase. One representative effective field theory model is used for the hardon phase. Various conditions are employed for hadron-quark phase transition and we employ an interface tension in a preferred range of $1-50~\rm MeV$. The results are compared with various ab-initio calculations. We find a characteristic behavior of dynamical rescaling of the bag constant on the sound velocity in quark matter, which resembles that of quark deconfinement phase transition at $\sim3-7$ times of nuclear saturation density. And it leads to a much compact star with similar mass. We also propose a new class of quark star equation of states attributing the feature. The quark star equation of state model, as well as the in-medium scaling of the bag parameter, in our calculation can be tested by future high-precision radius measurements of pulsar-like objects.","Chengjun Xia, Zhenyu Zhu, Xia Zhou, Ang Li","12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",1906.00826v1,No journal ref found,Ang Li,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00826v1,2019-06-03 14:13:23+00:00,nucl-th,nucl-th|astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR|hep-ph,Sound velocity in dense stellar matter and quark star equation of state,2019-06-03 14:13:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00826v1

445,"We present the results of the monitoring campaign of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2018cnf (aka ASASSN-18mr). It was discovered about 10 days before the maximum light (on MJD = 58293.4+-5.7 in the V band, with MV = -18.13+-0.15 mag). The multiband light curves show an immediate post-peak decline with some minor luminosity fluctuations, followed by a flattening starting about 40 days after maximum. The early spectra are relatively blue and show narrow Balmer lines with P Cygni profiles. Fe II, O I, He I and Ca II are also detected. The spectra show little evolution with time, with intermediate-width features becoming progressively more prominent, indicating stronger interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium. The inspection of archival images from the Pan-STARRS survey has revealed a variable source at the SN position, with a brightest detection in December 2015 at Mr = -14.66+-0.17 mag. This was likely an eruptive phase from the massive progenitor star started at least from mid-2011, and that produced the circumstellar environment within which the star exploded as a Type IIn SN. The overall properties of SN 2018cnf closely resemble those of transients such as SN 2009ip.

446,"We present extensive data sets for a class of intermediate-luminosity optical transients known as ``luminous red novae'' (LRNe). These transients show double-peaked light curves, with a first rapid luminosity rise to a blue peak (at -13 to -15 mag), which is followed by a longer-duration red peak, that sometimes is attenuated resembling a plateau. The progenitors of three of them (NGC4490-2011OT1, M101-2015OT1 and SNhunt248), likely intermediate-mass yellow supergiants, were also observed in a pre-eruptive stage, when their luminosity was slowly increasing. Early spectra, obtained during the first peak, show a blue continuum with superposed prominent narrow Balmer lines, with P~Cygni profiles. Lines of Fe II are also clearly detected, mostly in emission. During the second peak, the spectral continuum becomes much redder, Halpha is barely detected, and a forest of narrow metal lines is observed in absorption. Very late-time spectra (~6 months after blue peak) show an extremely red spectral continuum, peaking in the infrared domain. Halpha is detected in pure emission at such late phases, along with broad absorption bands due to molecular overtones (TiO, VO). We discuss a few alternative scenarios for LRNe. Although major instabilities of single massive stars cannot be definitely ruled out, we favour a binary system scenario, with a common envelope ejection possibly ending with a final merging event. The similarity between LRNe and the outburst observed a few months before the explosion of the Type IIn SN 2011ht is also discussed.","A. Pastorello, E. Mason, S. Taubenberger, M. Fraser, G.

At peak, the object reaches an absolute magnitude of Mg=-15.46+-0.15 mag and a bolometric luminosity of 5.5x10^41 erg/s. Its light curve has the double-peak shape typical of Luminous Red Novae (LRNe), with a narrow first peak bright in the blue bands, while the second peak is longer lasting and more luminous in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. During the first peak, the spectrum shows a blue continuum with narrow emission lines of H and Fe II. During the second peak, the spectrum becomes cooler, resembling that of a K-type star, and the emission lines are replaced by a forest of narrow lines in absorption. About 5 months later, while the optical light curves are characterized by a fast linear decline, the NIR ones show a moderate rebrightening, observed until the transient disappeared in solar conjunction. At these late epochs, the spectrum becomes reminiscent of that of M-type stars, with prominent molecular absorption bands. The late-time properties suggest the formation of some dust in the expanding common envelope or an IR echo from foreground pre-existing dust.

Michael Hippke [2] has pointed out that it may be possible to use neutrinos or gravitational waves as signals. Gravitational waves demand the command of the generation of very large scale amounts of energy, Jackson and Benford [3]. This paper describes a beacon that uses beamed neutrinos as the signal. Neutrinos, like gravitational waves, have the advantage of extremely low extinction in the interstellar medium. To make use of neutrinos an advanced civilization can use a gravitational lens as a focus and amplifier. The lens can be a neutron star or a black hole. Using wave optics one can calculate the advantage of gravitational lensing for amplification of a beam and along the optical axis it is exceptionally large. Even though the amplification is very large the dimeter of the beam is quite small, less that a centimeter. This implies that a large constellation of neutrino transmitters would have to enclose the local neutron star or black hole to cover the sky.

Thanks to Swift and XMM-Newton observations covering ~5000d, we report the discovery of a regular 108d modulation in X-ray flux of unknown origin. The minimum in the high-energy flux appears due to a combination of increased absorption and decreased intrinsic emission. We examined in parallel the data from a dedicated spectroscopic and photometric monitoring in the visible and near-IR domains, complemented by archives. While a similar variation timescale is found in those data, they do not exhibit the strict regular clock found at high energies. Changes in line profiles cannot be related to binarity but rather correspond to non-radial pulsations.

451,"We present spectra and near-infrared images of a sample of faint radio sources initially selected as promising high-redshift radio galaxy (HzRG) candidates. We have determined redshifts for a total of 13 radio galaxies with redshifts ranging from $0.52\le z \le 5.72$. Our sample probes radio luminosities that are almost an order of magnitude fainter than previous large samples at the highest redshifts. We use near-infrared photometry for a subsample of these galaxies to calculate stellar masses using simple stellar population models, and find stellar masses to be in the range $10^{10.8} - 10^{11.7} M_\odot$. We then compare our faint radio galaxies with brighter radio galaxies at $z\ge2$ from the literature. We find that fainter radio galaxies have lower Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and narrower full width at half maxima compared to the bright ones, implying photoionisation by weaker AGN. We also rule out the presence of strong shocks in faint HzRGs. The stellar masses determined for faint HzRGs are lower than what has been observed for brighter ones. We find that faint HzRG population in the redshift range $2-4$ forms a bridge between star-forming and narrow-line AGN, whereas the ones at $z>4$ are dominated by star-formation, and may be building up their stellar mass through cold accretion of gas. Finally, we show that the overall redshift evolution of radio sizes at $z>2$ is fully compatible with increased inverse Compton scattering losses at high redshifts.","A. Saxena, H. J. A.

We reconstruct the subhalo mass component with robust stellar kinematics of cluster galaxies, coupled with precise strong lensing models from large samples of spectroscopically confirmed multiple images. We use VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy in the cluster cores to measure the stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of 40-60 member galaxies per cluster, covering 4-5 magnitudes to $m_{F160W}\simeq 21.5$. We test the accuracy of velocity dispersion measurements on mock spectra, thus quantifying the limiting signal-to-noise and minimum velocity ($\sigma>80$ km/s) for the depth of the spectra presented here. With these data, we determine the normalization and slope of the Faber-Jackson relation in each cluster and use it a prior for the scaling relations of the sub-halo population in the lensing mass models. Compared to our previous lens models, the inclusion of stellar kinematics yields a similar precision in the predicted positions of the multiple images. However, the inherent degeneracy between the central effective velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$, and truncation radius, $r_{cut}$, of subhalos is strongly reduced, significantly alleviating systematics in the measurements of subhalo masses. The three independent determinations of the $\sigma_0\mbox{-}r_{cut}$ relation in each cluster are fully consistent, enabling a statistical determination of subhalo sizes at given $\sigma_0$ or mass. Finally, we derive the galaxy central velocity dispersion functions of the three clusters projected within 16\% of their virial radii, finding that they are well in agreement with each other. This methodology, when applied to high-quality kinematics and strong lensing data, allows the subhalo mass functions to be determined and compared with predictions from cosmological simulations.","P.

454,"We consider models of scalar dark matter with a generic interaction potential and non-canonical kinetic terms of the K-essence type that are subleading with respect to the canonical term. We analyse the low-energy regime and derive, in the nonrelativistic limit, the effective equations of motions. In the fluid approximation they reduce to the conservation of matter and to the Euler equation for the velocity field. We focus on the case where the scalar field mass $10^{-21} \ll m \lesssim 10^{-4} \, {\rm eV}$ is much larger than for fuzzy dark matter, so that the quantum pressure is negligible on cosmological and galactic scales, while the self-interaction potential and non-canonical kinetic terms generate a significant repulsive pressure. At the level of cosmological perturbations, this provides a dark-matter density-dependent speed of sound. At the non-linear level, the hydrostatic equilibrium obtained by balancing the gravitational and scalar interactions imply that virialized structures have a solitonic core of finite size depending on the speed of sound of the dark matter fluid. For the most relevant potential in $\lambda_4 \phi^4/4$ or K-essence with a $(\partial \phi)^4$ interaction, the size of such stable cores cannot exceed 60 kpc. Structures with a density contrast larger than $10^6$ can be accommodated with a speed of sound $c_s\lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also consider the case of a cosine self-interaction, as an example of bounded non-polynomial self-interaction. This gives similar results in low-mass and low-density halos whereas solitonic cores are shown to be absent in massive halos.","Philippe Brax, Jose A. R.

457,"(Abridged) The purpose of this paper is to explore the structure of a line-rich Class I protobinary source, Oph-IRS 67, and analyse the differences and similarities with Class 0 and Class II sources. We present a systematic molecular line study of IRS 67 with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on 1 - 2"" (150 - 300 AU) scales. The wide instantaneous band-width of the SMA observations (~30 GHz) provide detections of a range of molecular transitions that trace different physics, such as CO isotopologues, sulphur-bearing species, deuterated species, and carbon-chain molecules. We see significant differences between different groups of species. For example, the CO isotopologues and sulphur-bearing species show a rotational profile and are tracing the larger-scale circumbinary disc structure, while CN, DCN, and carbon-chain molecules peak at the southern edge of the disc at blue-shifted velocities. In addition, the cold gas tracer DCO+ is seen beyond the extent of the circumbinary disc. The detected molecular transitions can be grouped into three main components: cold regions far from the system, the circumbinary disc, and a UV-irradiated region likely associated with the surface layers of the disc that are reached by the UV radiation from the sources. The different components are consistent with the temperature structure derived from the ratio of two H2CO transitions, that is, warm temperatures are seen towards the outflow direction, lukewarm temperatures are associated with the UV-radiated region, and cold temperatures are related with the circumbinary disc structure. The chemistry towards IRS 67 shares similarities with both Class 0 and Class II sources, possibly due to the high gas column density and the strong UV radiation arising from the binary system. IRS 67 is, therefore, highlighting the intermediate chemistry between deeply embedded sources and T-Tauri discs.","E. Artur de la Villarmois, L. E. Kristensen, J. K.

458,"We present CO observations of 78 spiral galaxies in local merger pairs. These galaxies representa subsample of a Ks-band selected sample consisting of 88 close major-merger pairs (HKPAIRs), 44 spiral-spiral (S+S) pairs and 44 spiral-elliptical (S+E) pairs, with separation $<20 h^{-1}$ kpc and mass ratio <2.5. For all objects, the star formation rate (SFR) and dust mass were derived from HERSCHEL PACS and SPIRE data, and the atomic gas mass, MHI, from the Green Bank Telescope HI observations. The complete data set allows us to study the relation between the gas (atomic and molecular) mass, dust mass and SFR in merger galaxies. We derive the molecular gas fraction (MH2/M*), molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio (MH2/MHI), gas-to-dust mass ratio and SFE (=SFR/MH2) and study their dependences on pair type (S+S compared to S+E), stellar mass and the presence of morphological interaction signs. We find an overall moderate enhancements (~2x) in both molecular gas fraction (MH2/M*), and molecular-to-atomic gas ratio (MH2/MHI) for star-forming galaxies in major-merger pairs compared to non-interacting comparison samples, whereas no enhancement was found for the SFE nor for the total gas mass fraction (MHI+MH2)/M*. When divided into S+S and S+E, low mass and high mass, and with and without interaction signs, there is a small difference in SFE, moderate difference in MH2/M*, and strong differences in MH2/MHI between subsamples. For MH2/MHI, the difference between S+S and S+E subsamples is 0.69+-0.16 dex and between pairs with and without interaction signs is 0.53+-0.18 dex. Together, our results suggest (1) star formation enhancement in close major-merger pairs occurs mainly in S+S pairs after the first close encounter (indicated by interaction signs) because the HI gas is compressed into star-forming molecular gas by the tidal torque; (2) this effect is much weakened in the S+E pairs.","Ute Lisenfeld, Cong Kevin Xu, Yu Gao, Donovan L.

459,"We present the results obtained with VLT/MUSE on the faint-end of the Lyman-alpha luminosity function (LF) based on deep observations of four lensing clusters. The precise aim of the present study is to further constrain the abundance of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) by taking advantage of the magnification provided by lensing clusters. We blindly selected a sample of 156 LAEs, with redshifts between $2.9 \le z \le 6.7$ and magnification-corrected luminosities in the range $ 39 \lesssim \log L_{Ly_{\alpha}}$ [erg s$^{-1}$] $\lesssim 43$. The price to pay to benefit from magnification is a reduction of the effective volume of the survey, together with a more complex analysis procedure. To properly take into account the individual differences in detection conditions (including lensing configurations, spatial and spectral morphologies) when computing the LF, a new method based on the 1/Vmax approach was implemented. The LAE LF has been obtained in four different redshift bins with constraints down to $\log L_{Ly_{\alpha}} = 40.5$. From our data only, no significant evolution of LF mean slope can be found. When performing a Schechter analysis including data from the literature to complete the present sample a steep faint-end slope was measured varying from $\alpha = -1.69^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ to $\alpha = -1.87^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ between the lowest and the highest redshift bins. The contribution of the LAE population to the star formation rate density at $z \sim 6$ is $\lesssim 50$% depending on the luminosity limit considered, which is of the same order as the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) contribution. The evolution of the LAE contribution with redshift depends on the assumed escape fraction of Lyman-alpha photons, and appears to slightly increase with increasing redshift when this fraction is conservatively set to one.

460,"Recently, seven Earth-sized planets were discovered around the M-dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. Thanks to transit-timing variations, the masses and therefore the bulk densities of the planets have been constrained, suggesting that all TRAPPIST-1 planets are consistent with water mass fractions on the order of 10%. These water fractions, as well as the similar planet masses within the system, constitute strong constraints on the origins of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In a previous work, we have outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario. In this paper we investigate this formation scenario in more detail. We use a Lagrangian smooth-particle method to model the growth and drift of pebbles and the conversion of pebbles to planetesimals through the streaming instability. We use the N-body code $\texttt{MERCURY}$ to follow the composition of planetesimals as they grow into protoplanets by merging and accreting pebbles. This code is adapted to account for pebble accretion, type-I migration, and gas drag. In this way, we model the entire planet formation process (pertaining to planet masses and compositions, not dynamical configuration). We find that planetesimals form in a single, early phase of streaming instability. The initially narrow annulus of planetesimals outside the snowline quickly broadens due to scattering. Our simulation results confirm that this formation pathway indeed leads to similarly-sized planets and is highly efficient in turning pebbles into planets. [...] The water content of planets resulting from our simulations is on the order of ten percent, and our results predict a `V-shaped' trend in the planet water fraction with orbital distance: from relatively high (innermost planets) to relatively low (intermediate planets) to relatively high (outermost planets).","Djoeke Schoonenberg, Beibei Liu, Chris W.

461,"The orbital period of compact binaries (neutron star-neutron star, neutron star-white dwarf) decay mainly due to the gravitational quadrupole radiation. The orbital period can also decay by radiation of other light particles like axions and axion like particles(ALPs). For axionic radiation to take place the orbital frequency of the quasi periodic motion of the binary system should be greater than the mass of the scalar particles which restricts the mass $m_a\ll 10^{-19}eV$. Ultra light axions $(m_a \sim 10^{-21}eV-10^{-22}eV)$ can be candidate for fuzzy dark matter (FDM). If a neutron star is immersed in the potential of axionic FDM it develops an axionic long range hair, which is radiated when the neutron star is in a binary orbit. In this paper we consider four compact binary systems: PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0737-3039, PSR J1738+0333, and PSR B1913+16 (Hulse Taylor Binary) and put constraints on axion decay constant $f_a\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{15}-10^{17}GeV)$. $f_a\sim 10^{17}GeV$ gives the correct relic dark matter density for FDM and arises naturally in string theory models.","Tanmay Kumar Poddar, Subhendra Mohanty, Soumya Jana","14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables",1906.00666v1,No journal ref found,Soumya Jana,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00666v1,2019-06-03 09:43:00+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Constraints on axion like dark matter from compact binary systems,2019-06-03 09:43:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00666v1
462,"Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in astroparticle physics experiments to detect light flashes (e.g. fluorescence or Cherenkov light) from extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by statistically rare very high energy cosmic particles when travelling through the atmosphere. Their high amplification factor (gain) allows the detection of very low photon fluxes down to single photons. At the same time this sensitivity causes the gain and signal-to-noise ratio to decrease with collected charge over the lifetime of the PMT (referred to as ""ageing""). To avoid fast ageing, many experiments limit the PMT operation to reasonably low night sky background (NSB) conditions. However, in order to collect more event statistics at the highest energies, it is desirable to extend the measurement cycle into (part of) nights with higher NSB levels. In case the signal-to-noise ratio remains large enough in the subsequent reconstruction of the EAS events, lowering the PMT gain in such conditions can be an option to avoid faster ageing. In this paper, performance studies under high NSB with Photonis XP3062 PMTs, as used in the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, are presented. The results suggest that lowering the PMT gain by a factor of 10 while increasing the NSB level by a similar factor does not significantly affect the PMT performance and ageing behaviour so that detection and offline reconstruction of EASs are still possible. Adjusting the PMT gain according to a changing NSB level throughout a night has been shown to be possible and it follows a predictable behaviour. This allows to extend the measurement cycles of experiments, based on PMTs of type Photonis XP3062 or comparable and exposed to the NSB, to enhance the sensitivity especially at the highest energies where events are very rare.","J.

Observational evidence for this mixing has been inconclusive so far however, limiting the evaluation of the impact of bars on galaxy evolution. We now use results from the MaNGA integral field spectroscopic survey to characterise radial stellar age and metallicity gradients along the bar and outside the bar in 128 strongly barred galaxies. We find that age and metallicity gradients are flatter in the barred regions of almost all barred galaxies when compared to corresponding disk regions at the same radii. Our results re-emphasize the key fact that by azimuthally averaging integral field spectroscopic data one loses important information from non-axisymmetric galaxy components such as bars and spiral arms.

465,"A previous study of the X-ray luminosity function of the X-ray sources in the field of the Draco dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy indicated the presence of a population of unknown X-ray sources in the soft energy range of 0.5-2 keV. In 2015, Draco dSph was observed again in twenty-six deep XMM-Newton, observations providing an opportunity for a new study of the yet unclassified sources. We apply the classification criteria presented in our previous multi-wavelength study of the X-ray sources of the Draco dSph to the sources detected in the combined 2009 and 2015 XMM-Newton data set. These criteria are based on X-ray studies and properties of the optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared counterparts and allows us to distinguish background active galactic nuclei~(AGNs) and galaxies from other types of X-ray sources. We present the classification of X-ray sources, for which the counterpart is identified as a stellar object based on our criteria from multi-wavelength data. We identify three new symbiotic stars in the Draco dSph with X-ray luminosities between $\sim$3.5$\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and 5.5$\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

466,"Solving the problem of fast eruptive events in magnetically dominated astrophysical plasmas requires the use of particularly well adapted numerical tools. Indeed, the central mechanism based on magnetic reconnection is determined by a complex behavior with quasi-singular forming current layers enriched by their associated small scale magnetic islands called plasmoids. A new code for the solution of two dimensional dissipative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in cartesian geometry specifically developed to this end is thus presented. A current-vorticity formulation representative of an incompressible model is chosen in order to follow the formation of the current sheets and the ensuing magnetic reconnection process. A finite element discretization using triangles with quadratic basis functions on an unstructured grid is employed, and implemented via a highly adaptive characteristic- Galerkin scheme. The adaptivity of the code is illustrated on simplified test equations and finally for magnetic reconnection associated to the non linear development of the tilt instability between two repelling current channels. Varying the Lundquist number S, has allowed to study the transition between the steady-state Sweet-Parker reconnection regime (for S < 10^4) and plasmoids dominated reconnection one (for S > 10^5).

The detected auto and cross-correlations provide a lower limit of 24 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ for the absolute sky brightness at 700-900 nm, which is consistent with previous observations. We searched for candidate objects to explain the detected large fluctuation using the catalog of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), and found that the surface number density of faint compact objects (FCOs) rapidly increases toward the faint end. Radial profiles of FCOs are indistinguishable from the PSF, and the effective radius based on de Vaucouleur's law is estimated to be smaller than 0.02 arcsec. The SEDs of FCOs follow a power law at optical wavelengths, but show greater emission and structure at $\lambda$ > 1 $\mu$m. Assuming that the FCOs are the cause of the excess brightness and fluctuations, the faint magnitude limit is 34.9 mag for the F775W band, and the surface number density reaches $2.6 \times 10^3$ (arcsec)$^{-2}$. Recent gamma-ray observations require that the redshift of FCOs must be less than 0.1, if FCOs are the origin of the excess optical and infrared background. Assuming that FCOs consist of missing baryons, the mass and luminosity of a single FCO range from $10^{2}$ to 1$0^{3}$ solar units, and mass-to-luminosity ratio is significantly lower than 1.0 solar unit. The maximum effective radius of an FCO is 4.7 pc. These results and the good correlation between near-infrared and X-ray background indicate that FCOs could be powered by the gravitational energy associated with black holes.","Toshio Matsumoto, Kohji Tsumura","37 pages, 21 figures, accepted to PASJ",1906.01443v1,No journal ref found,Kohji Tsumura,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01443v1,2019-06-03 08:14:12+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,Fluctuation of the background sky in the Hubble Extremely Deep Field   (XDF) and its origin,2019-06-03 08:14:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01443v1
469,"Age estimation techniques such as gyrochronology and magnetochronology can't be applied to stars that exchanged angular momentum with their close environment. This is especially true for massive close-in planetary companion (with a periods of few days or less), which could have been strongly impacted the rotational evolution of the host star, along the stellar evolution, through the star-planet tidal interaction.   We showed that the interaction of a close-in massive planet with its host star can strongly modify the surface rotation rate of this latter, in most of the cases associated to a planetary engulfment. In such cases, a gyrochronology analysis of the star would wrongly make it appear as ""rejuvenated"", thus preventing us to use this method with confidence. To try overcome this issue, we eventually proposed the proof of concept of a new age determination technique that we call the tidal-chronology, which is based on the observed couple $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm P_{orb}$ of a given star-planet system.   The gyrochronology technique can only be applied to isolated star or star-planet systems outside a specific range of $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm P_{orb}$. This region tends to expand for increasing stellar and planetary mass. In that forbidden region, or if any planetary engulfment is suspected, gyrochronology should be used with extreme caution while tidal-chronology could be considered. While this technique does not provide a precise age for the system yet, it is already an extension of gyrochronology and could be helpful to determine a more precise range of possible age for planetary system composed of a star between 0.3 and 1.2 $M_{\odot}$ and a planet more massive than 1 $\rm M_{jup}$ initially located at few hundredth au of the host star.","Florian Gallet, Philippe Delorme","12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A.

470,"The triple-alpha process, whereby evolved stars create carbon and oxygen, is believed to be fine-tuned to a high degree. Such fine-tuning is suggested by the unusually strong temperature dependence of the triple-alpha reaction rate at stellar temperatures. This sensitivity is due to the resonant character of the triple-alpha process, which proceeds through the so-called ""Hoyle state"" of $^{12}$C with spin-parity $0^+$. The question of fine-tuning can be studied within the {\it ab initio} framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory, which makes it possible to relate {\it ad hoc} changes in the energy of the Hoyle state to changes in the fundamental parameters of the nuclear Hamiltonian, which are the light quark mass $m_q$ and the electromagnetic fine-structure constant. Here, we update the effective field theory calculation of the sensitivity of the triple-alpha process to small changes in the fundamental parameters. In particular, we consider recent high-precision lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon axial coupling $g_A$, as well as new and more comprehensive results from stellar simulations of the production of carbon and oxygen. While the updated stellar simulations allow for much larger {\it ad hoc} shifts in the Hoyle state energy than previously thought, recent lattice QCD results for the nucleon S-wave singlet and triplet scattering lengths now disfavor the scenario of no fine-tuning in the light quark mass $m_q$.","Timo A.

472,"We study the effect of titled magnetic axis in a slowly rotating magnetar. We present our problem in a GR framework and solve it using a perturbative approach. We assume that the magnetar's rotational speed is small and had neglected rotational distortion. We consider a strong poloidal magnetic field in the star which imparts considerable distortion along the magnetic axis. The frame dragging due to the rotation of such a magnetar arises both from the $\theta$ and $\phi$ direction. We solve the Einstein equation up to 1st order perturbation in rotation and second-order perturbation in the magnetic field to obtain the equation of motion. Solving the equation of motion, we find the geodesic of a particle near the surface of the star, and we find that the path of the particle bends southwards due to the $\theta$ contribution. The bending of the path of the particle depends both on the magnetic field strength and also on the extent of misalignment of the magnetic and rotational axis.","Debojoti Kuzur, Ritam Mallick","15 pages, 9 figures",1906.00601v1,No journal ref found,Ritam Mallick,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00601v1,2019-06-03 07:02:50+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|gr-qc,Studying obliquilly rotating magnetars,2019-06-03 07:02:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00601v1

474,"The CMB observation sets stringent constraints on MeV dark matter (DM) annihilating into charged states/photons in s-wave, and the recent observation of the 21-cm absorption at the cosmic dawn reported by EDGES is also very strict for s-wave annihilations of MeV DM. The millicharged DM with p-wave dominant annihilations during the freeze-out period are considered in literatures to give an explanation about the 21-cm absorption, with photon mediated scattering cooling the hydrogen. In this paper, we focus on the annihilation of millicharged DM being s-wave dominant. To explain the 21-cm absorption and meanwhile be compatible with constraints from CMB and the 21-cm absorption, we consider the annihilation close to the resonance, with the new mediator (here is dark photon) mass being slightly above twice of the millicharged DM mass. In this case, the annihilation cross section at the temperature $T \to 0$ could be much smaller than that at $T_f$, which would be tolerated by constraints from the anomalous 21-cm absorption, avoiding the excess heating from DM s-wave annihilations to the hydrogen gas. The millicharged DM of concern could evade DM direct detection experiments, and the beam dump and lepton collider experiments can be employed to hunt for millicharged DM via the production of the invisible dark photon.","Lian-Bao Jia, Xu Liao","6 pages, 3 figures",1906.00559v1,No journal ref found,Xu Liao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00559v1,2019-06-03 04:03:59+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,A possible s-wave annihilation for MeV dark matter with the 21-cm   absorption,2019-06-03 04:03:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00559v1

Using the lattice simulation, we analyze the rescattering between the $\chi$ particles and the inflaton condensate, and the backreaction effect of the scalar metric perturbations. We find that the rescattering is an efficient mechanism promoting the growth of the $\chi$ field variance. Meanwhile, copious inflaton particles can be knocked out of the inflaton condensate by rescattering. As a result, the inflaton field can become a nonnegligible gravitational wave source, even comparable with the $\chi$ field in some parameter regions.

476,"We investigate the stability of a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF), which is expected to be formed in the gravitational collapse of a massive star or the merger of a neutron star binary, based on the variable-$\alpha$ prescription. Recent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations shows that the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is proportional to the power of the magnetic Prandtl number ${\rm Pm}=\nu/\eta$, where $\nu$ and $\eta$ are the kinematic viscosity and electric resistivity of the fluid, respectively. In the inner region of a hyperaccretion flow, the viscosity and resistivity are carried by mildly, relativistically degenerated electrons. We fit the dependence of the magnetic Prandtl number on density and temperature by a simple analytic form, and derive the condition for an NDAF to be dynamically unstable. As demonstrations we perform simple one-dimensional simulations of NDAFs with the variable-$\alpha$ and show that the mass accretion becomes highly time-variable in the unstable branch. This mechanism may account for the rapid variability observed in the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The mass ejection from a hyperaccretion flow due to viscous heating, which makes a kilonova/macronova emission in the merger of a neutron star binary, is also briefly discussed.","Norita Kawanaka, Youhei Masada","10 pages, 6 figures; revised following comments from referee",1902.08624v2,No journal ref found,Youhei Masada,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08624v2,2019-02-22 19:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows with Magnetic Prandtl   Number-Dependent MRI-driven Turbulence,2019-06-03 03:26:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08624v2

Tests with mock galaxy catalogs demonstrate that this method can successfully recover (within $\sim 1\sigma$) the intrinsic large-scale galaxy bias, as well as the HOD models and the effective photometric redshift uncertainty.

478,"We forecast the linear bias for H${\rm \alpha}$-emitting galaxies at high redshift. To simulate a Euclid-like and a WFIRST-like survey, we place galaxies into a large-volume dark matter halo lightcone by sampling a library of luminosity-dependent halo occupation distributions (HODs), which is constructed using a physically motivated galaxy formation model. We calibrate the dust attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the H{\alpha} luminosity function or the H{\alpha} cumulative number counts. The angle-averaged galaxy correlation function is computed for each survey in redshift slices of width $\Delta z = 0.2$. In each redshift bin the linear bias can be fitted with a single, scale-independent value that increases with increasing redshift. Fitting for the evolution of linear bias with redshift, we find that our Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys are both consistent within error with the relation $b(z) = 0.7z + 0.7$. Our bias forecasts are consistent with bias measurements from the HiZELS survey. We find that the Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys yield linear biases that are broadly consistent within error, most likely due to the HOD for the WFIRST-like survey having a steeper power-law slope towards larger halo masses.","Alexander Merson, Alex Smith, Andrew Benson, Yun Wang, Carlton Baugh","30 pages including 8 pages of appendices. 17 figures.

479,"The detection of gravitational waves together with their electromagnetic counterpart, in the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, marked a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the atypical behaviour of this event. Recently, it was shown that the multi-wavelength afterglow of GRB 170817A was consistent with a synchrotron forward-shock model when the outflow was viewed off-axis, decelerated in a uniform medium and parametrized through a power-law velocity distribution. Motivated by the upper limits on the very-high-energy emission, and the stratified medium in the close vicinity of a binary neutron star merger proposed to explain the gamma-ray flux in the short GRB 150101B, we extend the mechanism proposed to explain GRB 170817A to a more general scenario deriving the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and synchrotron forward-shock model when the off-axis outflow is decelerated in a uniform and stratified circumburst density. As particular cases, we show that the delayed and long-lasting afterglow emission observed in GRB 080503, GRB140903A, GRB 150101B and GRB 160821B could be interpreted by a similar scenario to the one used to describe GRB 170817A.

480,"The annihilation of cosmic positrons ($e^+$) with electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) results in the strongest persistent gamma-ray line signal in the sky. For 50 years, this 511 keV emission has puzzled observers and theoreticians. A key issue for understanding $e^+$-astrophysics is found in cosmic-ray propagation, especially at low kinetic energies (< 10 MeV). We want to shed light on how $e^+$s propagate and the resulting morphology of the emission. We approach this ""positron puzzle"" by inferring kinematic information of the 511 keV line in the inner radian of the Galaxy. This constrains propagation scenarios and source populations. By dissecting the 511 keV emission as measured with INTEGRAL/SPI, we derive spectra for individual regions in the sky. The centroid energies are converted into Doppler-shifts, representing the line-of-sight velocity along different longitudes. This results in a longitude-velocity diagram of $e^+$-annihilation. We also determine Doppler-broadenings to study annihilation conditions as they vary across the Galaxy. We find line-of-sight velocities in the 511 keV line that are consistent with zero, as well as with galactic rotation from CO measurements, and measurements of radioactive Al-26. The velocity gradient in the inner 60 deg is determined to be $4\pm6$ km/s/deg. The 511 keV line width is constant as a function of longitude at $2.43\pm0.14$ keV. The positronium fraction is found to be 1.0 along the galactic plane. The weak signals in the disk leave open the question whether $e^+$-annihilation is associated with the high velocities seen in Al-26 or rather with ordinarily rotating components of the Galaxy's ISM. We confirm previous results that $e^+$s are slowed down to the 10 eV energy scale before annihilation, and constrain bulk Doppler-broadening contributions to <1.25 keV. Consequently, the true annihilation conditions remain unclear.","Thomas Siegert, Roland M. Crocker, Roland Diehl, Martin G. H. Krause, Fiona H. Panther, Moritz M. M.

481,"Force-free pulsar magnetospheres develop a large scale poloidal electric current circuit that flows along open magnetic field lines from the neutron star to the termination shock. The electric current closes through the interior of the neutron star where it provides the torque that spins-down the star. In the present work, we study the internal electric current in an axisymmetric rotator. We evaluate the path of the electric current by requiring the minimization of internal Ohmic losses. We find that, in millisecond pulsars, the current reaches the base of the crust, while in pulsars with periods of a few seconds, the bulk of the electric current does not penetrate deeper than about $100$ m. The region of maximum spin-down torque in millisecond pulsars is the base of the crust, while in slowly spinning ones it is the outer crust. We evaluate the corresponding Maxwell stresses and find that, in typical rotation-powered radio pulsars, they are well below the critical stress that can be sustained by the crust. For magnetar-level fields, the Maxwell stresses near the surface are comparable to the critical stress and may lead to the decoupling of the crust from the rest of the stellar rotation.","V.

For a single tracer the uncertainties on $\beta$ are constrained by the uncertainties in the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum, which is limited by cosmic variance. However, for two or more tracers this limit does not apply, since taking the ratio of power spectra cosmic variance cancels out, and in the linear (Kaiser) approximation one measures directly the quantity $(1+ \beta_1 \mu^2)^2/(1+ \beta_2 \mu^2)^2$, where $\mu$ is the angle of a given mode with the line of sight. We provide analytic formulae for the Fisher matrix for one and two tracers, and quantify the signal-to-noise ratio needed to make effective use of the multiple-tracer technique.

483,"We connect two formalisms that describe deformations away from general relativity, one valid in the strong-field regime of neutrons stars and another valid in the radiative regime of gravitational waves: the post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and the parametrized-post-Einsteinian formalisms respectively. We find that post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff deformations of the exterior metric of an isolated neutron star induce deformations in the orbital binding energy of a neutron star binary. Such a modification to the binding energy then percolates into the gravitational waves emitted by such a binary, with the leading-order post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff modifications introducing a second post-Newtonian order correction to the gravitational wave phase. The lack of support in gravitational wave data for General Relativity deformations at this post-Newtonian order can then be used to place constraints post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff parameters. As an application, we use the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 to place the constraint $-2.4 \leq \chi \leq 44$ (at 90% credibility) on a combination of post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff parameters. We also explore the implications of this result to the possible deformations of the mass-radius relation of neutron stars allowed within this formalism.

484,"We have performed the first 3-dimensional simulations of strong first-order thermal phase transitions in the early Universe. For deflagrations, we find that the rotational component of the fluid velocity increases as the transition strength is increased. For detonations, however, the rotational velocity component remains constant and small. We also find that the efficiency with which kinetic energy is transferred to the fluid falls below theoretical expectations as we increase the transition strength. The probable origin of the kinetic energy deficit is the formation of reheated droplets of the metastable phase during the collision, slowing the bubble walls. The rate of increase in the gravitational wave energy density for deflagrations in strong transitions is suppressed compared to that predicted in earlier work. This is largely accounted for by the reduction in kinetic energy. Current modelling therefore substantially overestimates the gravitational wave signal for strong transitions with deflagrations, in the most extreme case by a factor of $10^{3}$. Detonations, however, are less affected.","Daniel Cutting, Mark Hindmarsh, David J. Weir","6+3 pages, 5+2 figures. Movies illustrating the physics in this paper

The value of the inflaton mass $m$ is calculated using the observational value of the power spectrum of the scalar perturbations, and the value of mass $M$, which depends on the reheating temperature, is calculated by solving the corresponding dynamical system whose initial conditions are taken at the matter-radiation equality and are obtained from three observational data: the red shift at the matter-radiation equality, the ratio of the matter energy density to the critical one at the present time and the current value of the Hubble parameter.","Jaume Haro, Jaume Amorós, Supriya Pan","28 pages; 7 captioned figures; accepted by The European Physical

486,"Wide field surveys for transiting planets are well suited to searching diverse stellar populations, enabling a better understanding of the link between the properties of planets and their parent stars. We report the discovery of HAT-P-69 b (TOI 625.01) and HAT-P-70 b (TOI 624.01), two new hot Jupiters around A stars from the HATNet survey which have also been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). HAT-P-69 b has a mass of 3.73 (+0.61/-0.59) Mjup and a radius of 1.626 (+0.032/-0.025) Rjup, and is in a prograde 4.79-day orbit around a star of mass 1.698+/-0.025 Msun and radius 1.854 (+0.043/-0.022) Rsun. HAT-P-70 b has a radius of 1.87 (+0.15/-0.10) Rjup and a mass constraint of <6.78 (3sigma) Mjup, and is in a retrograde 2.74-day orbit around a star of mass 1.890 (+0.010/-0.013) Msun and radius 1.858 (+0.119/-0.091) Rsun. We use the confirmation of these planets around relatively massive stars as an opportunity to explore the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters as a function of stellar mass. We define a sample of 47,126 main-sequence stars brighter than Tmag=10 that yields 31 giant planet candidates, including 18 confirmed planets, 3 candidates, and 10 false positives. We find a net hot Jupiter occurrence rate of 0.45+/-0.10% within this sample, consistent with the rate measured by Kepler for FGK stars. When divided into stellar mass bins, we find the occurrence rate to be 0.71+/-0.31% G stars, 0.43+/-0.15% for F stars, and 0.32+/-0.12% for A stars. Thus, at this point, we cannot discern any statistically significant trend in the occurrence of hot Jupiters with stellar mass.","G. Zhou, C. Huang, G. Bakos, J. Hartman, D. Latham, S. Quinn, K.

We have discovered a total sample of N = 630 events within an area covering 20.7 sq. deg. Using the near-IR color magnitude diagram we selected N = 291 red clump sources, allowing us to analyse the longitude dependence of microlensing across the central region of the Galactic plane. We thoroughly accounted for the photometric and sampling efficiency. The spatial distribution is homogeneous, with the number of events smoothly increasing toward the Galactic center. We find a slight asymmetry, with a larger number of events toward negative longitudes than positive longitudes, that is possibly related with the inclination of the bar along the line of sight.

488,"We investigate to which precision local magnification ratios, $\mathcal{J}$, ratios of convergences, $f$, and reduced shears, $g = (g_{1}, g_{2})$, can be determined model-independently for the five resolved multiple images of the source at $z_\mathrm{s}=1.675$ in CL0024. We also determine if a comparison to the respective results obtained by the parametric modelling program Lenstool and by the non-parametric modelling program Grale can detect biases in the lens models. For these model-based approaches we additionally analyse the influence of the number and location of the constraints from multiple images on the local lens properties determined at the positions of the five multiple images of the source at $z_\mathrm{s}=1.675$. All approaches show high agreement on the local values of $\mathcal{J}$, $f$, and $g$. We find that Lenstool obtains the tightest confidence bounds even for convergences around one using constraints from six multiple image systems, while the best Grale model is generated only using constraints from all multiple images with resolved brightness features and adding limited small-scale mass corrections. Yet, confidence bounds as large as the values themselves can occur for convergences close to one in all approaches. Our results are in agreement with previous findings, supporting the light-traces-mass assumption and the merger hypothesis for CL0024. Comparing the three different approaches allows to detect modelling biases. Given that the lens properties remain approximately constant over the extension of the image areas covered by the resolvable brightness features, the model-independent approach determines the local lens properties to a comparable precision but within less than a second.

The theoretical void size function provides an accurate description of the simulation measurements for the different dark energy models considered, within the statistical errors.

490,"India's largest size 3.6 meter Devashal optical telescope (DOT) was commissioned in the year 2016, though the idea of building it germinated way back in the year 1976. This article provides research accounts as well as glimpses of its nearly four decades of journey. After a decade of site surveys, location of Devasthal in central Himalyan region of Kumaon was identified. Thereafter, a detailed site characterization was conducted and project approvals were obtained. The telescope is designed to be a technologically advanced optical astronomy instrument. It has been demonstrated to resolve a binary star having angular separation of 0.4 arc-sec. After the technical activation of the telescope on March 30, 2016, it has been in regular use for testing various back-end instruments as well as for optical and near-infrared observations of celestial objects. Back-end instruments used for these observations are 4KX4K CCD imager, Faint object imager cum spectrograph and TIFR near-infrared camera-II. A few published science results based on the observations taken with the telescope are also presented. Furthermore, the routine observations find that for a good fraction of observing time the telescope provides sky images of sub-arc-second resolution at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This indicates that the extreme care taken in the design and construction of the telescope dome building has been rewarding since the as-built thermal mass contributes minimally so as not to degrade the natural atmospheric seeing measured at Devasthal about two decades ago during 1997-1999 using differential image motion monitor. The overall on-site performance of the telescope is found to be excellent and at par with the performance of other similar telescopes located over the globe.","Ram Sagar, Brijesh Kumar, Amitesh Omar","Accepted in Current Science on May 31, 2019; Number of pages 23;

491,"Molecular oxygen has been the subject of many observational searches as chemical models predicted it to be a reservoir of oxygen. Although it has been detected in two regions of the interstellar medium, its rarity is a challenge for astrochemical models. In this paper, we have combined the physical conditions computed with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with our full gas-grain chemical model Nautilus, to study the predicted O2 abundance in interstellar material forming cold cores. We thus follow the chemical evolution of gas and ices in parcels of material from the diffuse interstellar conditions to the cold dense cores. Most of our predicted O2 abundances are below 1e-8 (with respect to the total proton density) and the predicted column densities in simulated cold cores is at maximum a few 1e14 cm-2, in agreement with the non detection limits. This low O2 abundance can be explained by the fact that, in a large fraction of the interstellar material, the atomic oxygen is depleted onto the grain surface (and hydrogenated to form H2O) before O2 can be formed in the gas-phase and protected from UV photo-dissociations. We could achieve this result only because we took into account the full history of the evolution of the physical conditions from the diffuse medium to the cold cores.","V. Wakelam, M. Ruaud, P.

492,We present a foliation-focused critical review of the boundary conditions and dynamics of 4D gravitational theories. A general coordinate transformation introduces a new foliation and changes the hypersurface on which a natural boundary condition is imposed; in this sense gauge transformations must be viewed as changing the boundary conditions. The issue of a gauge invariant boundary condition is nontrivial and has been extensively studied in the literature. We turn around the difficulty in obtaining such a boundary condition (and subtleties observed in the main body) and take it as one of the indications of an enlarged Hilbert space so as to include the states satisfying different boundary conditions. Through the systematical reduction procedure we obtain the explicit form of the reduced Lagrangian that describes the dynamics of the physical states. We examine the new insights offered by the 3D Lagrangian on BMS-type symmetry and black hole information. In particular we confirm that the boundary dynamics is an indispensable part of the system information.,I. Y.

493,"Axion Like Particles (ALPs) are one promising kind of dark matter candidate particles that are predicted to couple with photons in the presence of magnetic fields. The oscillations between photons and ALPs travelling in the magnetic fields have been used to constrain ALP properties. In this work, we obtain some new constraints on the ALP mass $m_{\rm a}$ and the photon-ALP coupling constant $g$ with two different magnetic field models through TeV photons from PKS 2155-304. One is the discrete-$\varphi$ model that the magnetic field has the orientation angle $\varphi$ changes discretely and randomly from one coherent domain to the next, another is the linearly-continuous-$\varphi$ model that the magnetic field orientation angle $\varphi$ varies continuously across neighboring coherent domains. For the discrete-$\varphi$ model, we can obtain the best constraints on the ALP mass $m_{1}=m_{\rm a}/(1\ {\rm neV})=0.1$ and on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{11}=g/(10^{-11}\ {\rm GeV^{-1}})=5$, the reasonable range of the ALP mass $m_{1}$ is 0.08 $\thicksim$ 0.2 when $g_{11}$=5, and the only reasonable value of the photon-ALP coupling constant is $g_{11}$=5 when $m_{1}$=0.1. For the linearly-continuous-$\varphi$ model, we can obtain the best constraints on the ALP mass $m_{1}=0.1$ and on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{11}=0.7$, the reasonable range of the ALP mass $m_{1}$ is 0.05 $\thicksim$ 0.4 when $g_{11}$=0.7, and the reasonable range of the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{11}$ is 0.5 $\thicksim$ 1 when $m_{1}$=0.1.

494,"We perform analysis of the three-dimensional kinematics of Milky Way disk stars in mono-age populations. We focus on stars between Galactocentric distances of $R=6$ and 14 \,kpc, selected from the combined LAMOST DR4 red clump giant stars and Gaia DR2 proper motion catalogue. We confirm the 3D asymmetrical motions of recent works, and we provide time tagging of the Galactic outer disk asymmetrical motions near the anticenter direction out to Galactocentric distances of 14\,kpc. Radial Galactocentric motions reach values up to 10 km s$^{-1}$, depending on the age of the population, and present a north-south asymmetry in the region corresponding to density and velocity substructures that were sensitive to the perturbations in the early 6 \,Gyr. After that time, the disk stars of this structure are becoming older and kinematically hotter and not sensitive to the possible perturbations, and we find it is a low $\alpha$, metal rich, relatively younger population. With the quantitative analysis, we find stars both above and below the plane at $R\gtrsim 9$ kpc exhibit bending mode motions of which the sensitive duration is around 8 \,Gyr. Some possible scenarios for these asymmetries are discussed, including a fast rotating bar, spiral arms, minor mergers, sub-halos, warp dynamics, and streams. Although we cannot rule out other factors, for the current results, we speculate that the in-plane asymmetries might be mainly caused by gravitational attraction of overdensities in a spiral arm or monolithic collapse of isolated self-gravitating overdensities from out-of-equilibrium systems. Vertical motions might be dominated by bending and breathing modes induced by inner or external perturbers.","H. -F. Wang, Y. Huang, J. L. Carlin, M. López-Corredoira, B. -Q. Chen, C. Wang, J.

495,"Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is thought to be responsible for the diverse chemical compositions of the rocky planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. Here we present a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions of planetesimals that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the condensation and partial advection and decoupling of the dust within it. The condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium. We show that the chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. A simple model based on the 50% condensation temperatures (T_{50}) predicts compositions of resulting planetesimals that are broadly consistent with those of CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling timescale of the dust is on the order of the evolution timescale of the disc or longer. If the decoupling timescale is an order of magnitude shorter than the evolution timescale of the disc then the calculated chemical compositions of planetesimals significantly deviate from the measured values. The relative elemental abundances in the condensed dust are highly affected by the thermal history of the disc. Our model can explain the chemical compositions of some of the terrestrial planets in the solar system and may constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.","Min Li, Shichun Huang, Michail I.

496,"The center determination of a galaxy cluster from an optical cluster finding algorithm can be offset from theoretical prescriptions or $N$-body definitions of its host halo center. These offsets impact the recovered cluster statistics, affecting both richness measurements and the weak lensing shear profile around the clusters. This paper models the centering performance of the \RM~cluster finding algorithm using archival X-ray observations of \RM-selected clusters. Assuming the X-ray emission peaks as the fiducial halo centers, and through analyzing their offsets to the \RM~centers, we find that $\sim 75\pm 8 \%$ of the \RM~clusters are well centered and the mis-centered offset follows a Gamma distribution in normalized, projected distance. These mis-centering offsets cause a systematic underestimation of cluster richness relative to the well-centered clusters, for which we propose a descriptive model.

497,"The TESS spacecraft observed the asynchronous polar CD Ind at a two-minute cadence almost continuously for 28 days in 2018, covering parts of 5 consecutive cycles of the system's 7.3-day beat period. These observations provide the first uninterrupted photometry of a full spin-orbit beat cycle of an asynchronous polar. Twice per beat cycle, the accretion flow switched between magnetic poles on the white dwarf, causing the spin pulse of the white dwarf (WD) to alternate between two waveforms after each pole-switch. An analysis of the waveforms suggests that one accretion region is continuously visible when it is active, while the other region experiences lengthy self-eclipses by the white dwarf. We argue that the previously accepted periods for both the binary orbit and the WD spin have been misidentified, and while the cause of this misidentification is a subtle and easily overlooked effect, it has profound consequences for the interpretation of the system's accretion geometry and doubles the estimated time to resynchronization. Moreover, our timings of the photometric maxima do not agree with the quadratic ephemeris from Myers et al. (2017), and it is possible that the optical spin pulse might be an unreliable indicator of the white dwarf's rotation. Finally, we use Doppler tomography of archival time-resolved spectra from 2006 to study the accretion flow. While the accretion flow showed a wider azimuthal extent than is typical for synchronous polars, it was significantly less extended than in the three other asynchronous polars for which Doppler tomography has been reported.","Colin Littlefield, Peter Garnavich, Koji Mukai, Paul A.

More than 250 epochs in $VRI$-bands are used to identify and classify variables up to $V\sim 21$~mag. We present a catalogue of optical time-series photometry with periods, mean-magnitudes and classifications for 95 variable stars including 67 pre-main-sequence variables towards star-forming region IC 5070. The pre-main-sequence variables are further classified as candidate classical T Tauri and weak-line T Tauri stars based on their light curve variations and the locations on the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams using optical and infrared data together with Gaia DR2 astrometry. Classical T Tauri stars display variability amplitudes up to three times the maximum fluctuation in disk-free weak-line T Tauri stars, which show strong periodic variations. Short-term variability is missed in our photometry within single nights. Several classical T Tauri stars display long-lasting ($\geq 10$ days) single or multiple fading and brightening events up to a couple of magnitudes at optical wavelengths. The typical mass and age of the pre-main-sequence variables from the isochrone-fitting and spectral energy distributions are estimated to be $\le 1~M_\odot$ and $\sim 2$ Myr, respectively.

We combine the DES-SN sample with an external sample of 122 low-redshift ($z$<0.1) SNe Ia, resulting in a ""DES-SN3YR"" sample of 329 SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded: after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB; Planck Collaboration 2016), our uncertainties in the measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, are .042 (stat) and .059 (stat+syst) at 68% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is <1/3 the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on $w$ are only larger by 1.4$\times$, showing the impact of the DES SN Ia light curve quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization parameters of the DES SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step ( 0.007 $\pm$ 0.018 mag) as a function of host galaxy mass for the DES subset, in 2.4$\sigma$ tension with previous measurements. We also present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia inserted in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in our analysis pipelines.","D.

500,"We examine the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using constrained realization cosmological simulations. We reconstruct the initial conditions (ICs) in the large volume BlueTides (BT) hydrodynamic simulation and run them to $z=6$. We compare the constrained simulations with BT to test the accuracy of this method for reproducing the first quasars and their environments. At the high redshifts of interest, non-linear mode coupling on the scale of even small simulation box sizes is not present. This allows our re-simulations in a volume of $(15h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$ to correctly recover the evolution of large-scale structure, and the stellar and BH mass functions in the vicinity of a $\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$ halo which we identified in BT at $z\sim7$ to be hosting a $\sim10^9M_{\odot}$ SMBH. Our re-simulations confirm that only with the lowest tidal field, high-density peaks in the ICs can induce the fastest BH growth required to explain the $z>6$ quasars. We carry out three simulations with the same ICs but different BH seed masses of $5\times10^3$, $5\times10^4$, and $5\times10^5h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ (the one used in BT) while keeping the halo to BH mass ratio fixed. We find that the BH mass converges to $\sim10^9M_{\odot}$ by $z=6$ regardless of the seeding procedure while their early growth histories at $z>10$ differ. The simulations with small BH seeds lead to the emergence of a large population of BHs which merge frequently at early times (four BH mergers, with masses $10^4\sim10^6M_{\odot}$ at $z\gtrsim12$). This is also accompanied by a few major BH mergers at $z\lesssim8$ for intermediate and small BH seeds while there are no mergers in the large BH seed simulation. The increased BH merger rate for low mass BH seeds provides an exciting prospect for discriminating BH formation mechanisms with the advent of multi-messenger astrophysics and next-generation GW facilities.","Kuan-Wei Huang, Yu Feng, Tiziana Di Matteo",No comment found,1906.00242v1,No journal ref found,Tiziana Di Matteo,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00242v1,2019-06-01 15:25:14+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The early growth of supermassive black holes in cosmological   hydrodynamic simulations with constrained Gaussian realizations,2019-06-01 15:25:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00242v1
501,"We present griz light curves of 251 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the first 3 years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program's (DES-SN) spectroscopically classified sample. The photometric pipeline described in this paper produces the calibrated fluxes and associated uncertainties used in the cosmological parameter analysis (Brout et al. 2018-SYS, DES Collaboration et al. 2018) by employing a scene modeling approach that simultaneously forward models a variable transient flux and temporally constant host galaxy. We inject artificial point sources onto DECam images to test the accuracy of our photometric method. Upon comparison of input and measured artificial supernova fluxes, we find flux biases peak at 3 mmag. We require corrections to our photometric uncertainties as a function of host galaxy surface brightness at the transient location, similar to that seen by the DES Difference Imaging Pipeline used to discover transients.

502,"Following the historical observations of GW170817 and its multi-wavelength afterglow, more radio afterglows from neutron star mergers are expected in the future as counterparts to gravitational wave inspiral signals. We wish to describe these events using our current knowledge of the intrinsic population of neutron star mergers coming from gamma-ray burst science, and taking into account the sensitivities of current and future gravitational wave and radio detectors. This is done by coupling a semi-analytical model for the jet-dominated radio afterglow from a neutron star merger, an analytical simplified model for the gravitational wave signal from such events, and a population model prescribing the energetics, external density and other relevant parameters of the mergers. We report the expected distributions of observables (distance, orientation, afterglow peak time and flux, etc.) from future events and study how these can be used to further probe the population of binary neutron stars, their mergers and related outflows during future observing campaigns. In the case of the O3 run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, the radio afterglow of one third of gravitational-wave-detected mergers should be detectable--and detected if the source is localized thanks to the kilonova counterpart--by the Very Large Array, and these events should have viewing angles similar to that of GW170817. These findings confirm the radio afterglow as a powerful insight on these events, though some key afterglow-related techniques--such as Very Long Base Interferometry imaging of the merger remnant--may no longer be possible as the gravitational wave horizon increases.","Raphaël Duque, Frédéric Daigne, Robert Mochkovitch","13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to A&A",1905.04495v2,No journal ref found,Robert Mochkovitch,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04495v2,2019-05-11 10:26:57+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Predictions for radio afterglows of binary neutron star mergers: a   population study for O3 and beyond,2019-06-01 15:07:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04495v2
503,"We utilize GIZMO, coupled with newly developed sub-grid models for Population~III (Pop~III) and Population~II (Pop~II), to study the legacy of star formation in the pre-reionization Universe. We find that the Pop~II star formation rate density (SFRD), produced in our simulation ($\sim 10^{-2}\ \Msun{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\simeq 10$), matches the total SFRD inferred from observations within a factor of $<2$ at $7\lesssim z \lesssim10$. The Pop~III SFRD, however, reaches a plateau at $\sim10^{-3}\ \Msun{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ by $z\approx10$, remaining largely unaffected by the presence of Pop~II feedback. At $z$=7.5, $\sim 20\%$ of Pop~III star formation occurs in isolated haloes which have never experienced any Pop~II star formation (i.e. primordial haloes). We predict that Pop~III-only galaxies exist at magnitudes $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -11$, beyond the limits for direct detection with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}. We assess that our stellar mass function (SMF) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) agree well with the observed low mass/faint-end behavior at $z=8$ and $10$. However, beyond the current limiting magnitudes, we find that both our SMF and UVLF demonstrate a deviation/turnover from the expected power-law slope ($M_{\rm UV,turn}= -13.4\pm1.1$ at $z$=10). This could impact observational estimates of the true SFRD by a factor of $2 (10)$ when integrating to $M_{\rm UV} = -$12 ($-$8) at $z\sim 10$, depending on integration limits. Our turnover correlates well with the transition from dark matter haloes dominated by molecular cooling to those dominated by atomic cooling, for a mass $M_{\rm halo}\approx 10^{8} \Msun$ at $z\simeq 10$.","Jason Jaacks, Steven L.

504,"We present analytical exploration of novel activation functions as consequence of integration of several ideas leading to implementation and subsequent use in habitability classification of exoplanets. Neural networks, although a powerful engine in supervised methods, often require expensive tuning efforts for optimized performance. Habitability classes are hard to discriminate, especially when attributes used as hard markers of separation are removed from the data set. The solution is approached from the point of investigating analytical properties of the proposed activation functions. The theory of ordinary differential equations and fixed point are exploited to justify the ""lack of tuning efforts"" to achieve optimal performance compared to traditional activation functions. Additionally, the relationship between the proposed activation functions and the more popular ones is established through extensive analytical and empirical evidence. Finally, the activation functions have been implemented in plain vanilla feed-forward neural network to classify exoplanets.","Snehanshu Saha, Nithin Nagaraj, Archana Mathur, Rahul Yedida","41 pages, 11 figures",1906.01975v1,No journal ref found,Rahul Yedida,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01975v1,2019-06-01 11:08:49+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|cs.LG|physics.data-an|stat.ML,Evolution of Novel Activation Functions in Neural Network Training with   Applications to Classification of Exoplanets,2019-06-01 11:08:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01975v1
505,"In the standard big bang model the universe starts in a radiation dominated era, where the gravitational perturbations are described by second order differential equations, which will generally have two orthogonal set of solutions. One is the so called {\it growing(cosine)} mode and the other is the {\it decaying(sine)} mode, where the nomenclature is derived from their behaviour on super-horizon(sub-horizon) scales. The decaying mode is qualitatively different to the growing mode of adiabatic perturbations as it evolves with time on \emph{super-horizon} scales. The time dependence of this mode on super-horizon scales is analysed in both the synchronous gauge and the Newtonian gauge to understand the true gauge invariant behaviour of these modes. We then explore constraints on the amplitude of this mode on scales between $k \sim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $k \sim 10^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using the temperature and polarization anisotropies from the cosmic microwave background, by computing the Fisher information. Binning the primordial power non-parametrically into 100 bins, we find that the decaying modes are constrained at comparable variance as the growing modes on scales smaller than the horizon today using temperature anisotropies. Adding polrisation data makes the decaying mode more constrained. The decaying mode amplitude is thus constrained by $\sim 1/l$ of the growing mode. On super-horizon scales, the growing mode is poorly constrained, while the decaying mode cannot substantially exceed the scale-invariant amplitude. This interpretation differs substantially from the past literature, where the constraints were quoted in gauge-dependent variables, and resulted in illusionary tight super-horizon decaying mode constraints. The results presented here can generally be used to non-parametrically constrain any model of the early universe.","Darsh Kodwani, P.

507,"We study the dynamics and observational predictions of warm inflation within a supersymmetric distributed mass model. This dissipative mechanism is well described by the interactions between the inflaton and a tower of chiral multiplets with a mass gap, such that different bosonic and fermionic fields become light as the inflaton scans the tower during inflation. We examine inflation for various mass distributions, analyzing in detail the dynamics and observational predictions. We show, in particular, that warm inflation can be consistently realized in this scenario for a broad parametric range and in excellent agreement with the Planck legacy data. Distributed mass models can be viewed as realizations of the landscape property of string theory, with the mass distributions coming from the underlying spectra of the theory, which themselves would be affected by the vacuum of the theory. We discuss the recently proposed swampland criteria for inflation models on the landscape and analyze the conditions under which they can be met within the distributed mass warm inflation scenario. We demonstrate mass distribution models with a range of consistency with the swampland criteria including cases in excellent consistency.","Mar Bastero-Gil, Arjun Berera, Rafael Hernández-Jiménez, João G.

509,"Neutron star due to their high interior matter density are expected to be composed of a quark core, a mixed quark-hadron matter, and a layer of hadronic matter. Thus, in this paper, we compute the equation of state of these parts of neutron star to evaluate its structure properties. We use two models for describing EOS of quark matter, NJL and MIT bag models, and employ three approaches in this work. A density dependent bag constant satisfy the quark confinement in the simple MIT bag model. We also study the interaction behavior of quarks, firstly one gluon exchange within MIT bag model and the secondly dynamical mass will be held as effective interaction that roles between particles. Density dependence of quark mass is obtained from NJL self consistent model. NJL model is a effective manner for justify the chiral symmetry. Applying the Gibbs conditions the equation of state of the quarks and hadrons mixed phase is obtained. Since the hadronic matter is under the influence of strong force of nucleons, we calculate the equation of state of this phase using a powerful variational many-body technique. Finally, we calculate the mass and radius of a cold neutron star with a quark core by numerically solving the TOV equation. To check our used EOS, we compare our results with the recent observational data. Our results are in a good agreement with some observed compact objects such as $SAXJ1748.9-2021$, $4U1608-52$ and $Vela X-1$.","T. Yazdizadeh, G. H. Bordbar","18 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables Iranian J.

The survey at 150 MHz with delta > -53.5 degrees has a sky coverage of 3.6 pi steradians, i.e., 90% of the whole sky. We created subsamples by applying different total flux thresholds limit (S >> 5 sigma) for good completeness and measured the angular correlation function omega(theta) of point sources at large scales ( >= 1 degree). We find that the amplitude of angular clustering is higher for brighter subsamples, this indicates that higher threshold flux samples are hosted by massive halos and cluster strongly: this conclusions is based on the assumption that the redshift distribution of sources does not change with flux and this is supported by models of radio sources. We compare our results with other low-frequency studies of clustering of point sources and verify that the amplitude of clustering varies with the flux limit. We quantify this variation as a power law dependence of the amplitude of correlation function with the flux limit. This dependence can be used to estimate foreground contamination due to clustering of point sources for low frequency HI intensity mapping surveys for studying the epoch of reionisation.","Sandeep Rana, J.

511,"We present results of the cross-correlation Lya intensity mapping with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) ultra-deep narrowband images and Lya emitters (LAEs) at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$ in a total area of $4$ deg$^2$. Although overwhelming amount of data quality controls have been performed for the narrowband images and the LAE samples, we further conduct extensive analysis evaluating systematics of large-scale point spread function wings, sky subtractions, and unknown errors on the basis of physically uncorrelated signals and sources found in real HSC images and object catalogs, respectively. Removing the systematics, we carefully calculate cross-correlations between Lya intensity of the narrowband images and the LAEs. We identify very diffuse Lya emission with the $3\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) significance at $>150$ comoving kpc (ckpc) far from the LAEs at $z = 5.7$ ($6.6$), beyond a virial radius of star-forming galaxies with $M_\mathrm{h} \sim 10^{11} M_\odot$. The diffuse Lya emission possibly extends up to $1,000$ ckpc with the surface brightness of $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. We confirm that the small-scale ($<150$ ckpc) Lya radial profiles of LAEs in our Lya intensity maps are consistent with those obtained by recent MUSE observations (Leclercq et al. 2017). Comparisons with numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale ($\sim 150-1,000$ ckpc) Lya emission are not explained by unresolved faint sources of neighboring galaxies including satellites, but by a combination of Lya photons emitted from the central LAE and other unknown sources, such as a cold-gas stream and galactic outflow. We find no evolution in the Lya radial profiles of our LAEs from $z=5.7$ to $6.6$, where theoretical models predict a flattening of the profile slope made by cosmic reionization, albeit with our moderately large observational errors.","Ryota Kakuma, Masami Ouchi, Yuichi Harikane, Akio K Inoue, Yutaka Komiyama, Haruka Kusakabe, Chien-Hsiu Liu, Yuichi Matsuda, Yoshiki Matsuoka, Ken Mawatari, Rieko Momose, Yoshiaki Ono, Takatoshi Shibuya, Yoshiaki Taniguchi",No comment found,1906.00173v1,No journal ref found,Yoshiaki Taniguchi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00173v1,2019-06-01 07:46:40+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,SILVERRUSH.

512,"We report the radiation hardness of a p-channel CCD developed for the X-ray CCD camera onboard the XRISM satellite. This CCD has basically the same characteristics as the one used in the previous Hitomi satellite, but newly employs a notch structure of potential for signal charges by increasing the implant concentration in the channel. The new device was exposed up to approximately $7.9 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~protons~cm^{-2}}$ at 100 MeV. The charge transfer inefficiency was estimated as a function of proton fluence with an ${}^{55} \mathrm{Fe}$ source. A device without the notch structure was also examined for comparison. The result shows that the notch device has a significantly higher radiation hardness than those without the notch structure including the device adopted for Hitomi.

513,"The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is investigated for a well-selected sample composed of $23$ Seyfert 1 galaxies observed simultaneously in the optical/UV and X-ray bands with the Neil Gehrels {\it Swift} Observatory. The optical to UV continuum spectra are modeled, for the first time, with emission from an accretion disk with a generalized radial temperature profile, in order to account for the intrinsic spectra which are found to be generally redder than the model prediction of the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) ($F_\nu\propto\nu^{+1/3}$). The power-law indices of the radial temperature profile ($T_{\rm eff}(R)\propto R^{-p}$, $R$ is the radius of the accretion disk) are inferred to be $p=0.5$ -- $0.75$ (a median of $0.63$), deviating from the canonical $p=0.75$ for the SSD model as widely adopted in previous studies. A marginal correlation of a flatter radial temperature profile (a smaller $p$ value) with increasing the Eddington ratio is suggested. Such a model produces generally a lower peak of accretion disk emission and thus a smaller bolometric luminosity in some of the AGN, particularly those with high Eddington ratios, than that based on the SSD model by a factor of several. The broadband SED, the bolometric correction factors and their dependence on some of the AGN parameters are re-visited. We suggest that such non-standard SSD disks may operate in AGN and are at least partly responsible for the reddened optical/UV spectra as observed. One possible explanation for these flattened temperature profiles is the mass loss process in form of disk winds/outflows.","Huaqing Cheng, Weimin Yuan, He-Yang Liu, A. A.

514,"We present synthetic light curves of fallback-powered supernovae based on a neutrino-driven explosion of a 40 Msun zero-metallicity star with significant fallback accretion onto a black hole that was previously simulated by Chan et al. (2018) until shock breakout. Here, we investigate the light curve properties of the explosion after shock breakout for various fallback models. Without extra power from fallback accretion, the light curve is that of a Type IIP supernova with a plateau magnitude of around -14 mag and a plateau duration of 40 days. With extra power for the light curve from fallback accretion, however, we find that the transient can be significantly more luminous. The light-curve shape can be SN 1987A-like or Type IIP-like, depending on the efficiency of the fallback engine. If the accretion disk forms soon after the collapse and more than 1% of the accretion energy is released as the central engine, fallback accretion powered supernovae become as luminous as superluminous supernovae. We suggest that Type II superluminous supernovae with broad hydrogen features could be related to such hydrogen-rich supernovae powered by fallback accretion. In the future, such superluminous supernovae powered by fallback accretion might be found among the supernovae from the first stars in addition to pair-instability supernovae and pulstational pair-instability supernovae.","Takashi J.

To advance our understanding of this impact, we revisit the concept of so-called slip-back mapping (Titov et al. 2009) and adapt it for determining open, closed, and disconnected flux systems that are formed in the solar corona by magnetic reconnection during a given time interval. The developed method allows us, in particular, to describe the magnetic flux transfer between open and closed flux regions via so-called interchange reconnection with unprecedented level of details. We illustrate the application of this method to the analysis of a global MHD evolution of the solar corona that is driven by an idealized differential rotation of the photospheric plasma.","R.

516,"The origin of the arc-shaped Sh2-296 nebula is still unclear. Mainly due to its morphology, the nebula has been suggested to be a 0.5 Myr-old supernova remnant (SNR) that could be inducing star formation in the CMa OB1 association. We aim to show, for the first time, that the nebula is part of a large, shell-like structure, which we have designated the ``CMa shell'', enclosing a bubble created by successive supernova (SN) explosions. We identified three runaway stars, associated with bow-shock structures, in the direction of the CMa shell and we investigate the possibility that they have originated in the center of the shell. By analyzing images of the CMa OB1 association at several wavelengths, we clearly see that the Sh2-296 nebula is in fact part of a large structure, which can be approximated by a large (with a diameter of ~60 pc) elliptical shell. Using the recent Gaia-DR2 astrometric data, we trace back the path of the three runaway stars, in order to find their original position in the past, with relation to the CMa shell. We also revise the heating and ionization of the Sh2-296 nebula, by comparing the photon budget provided by the O stars in the region with results from radio observations. We find that the runaway stars have likely been ejected from a Trapezium-like progenitor cluster on three successive SN explosions having taken place ~6, ~2 and ~1 Myr ago. We also show that the few late-type O stars in the region cannot explain the ionization of the Sh~2-296 nebula and other mechanisms need to be at work. We argue that, though we now have evidence for several SNe events in the CMa OB1 association, the SNe probably played a minor role in triggering star formation in these clouds. In contrast, the CMa OB1 association, as it is now, likely testifies to the last stages of a star-forming region.","B. Fernandes, T. Montmerle, T. Santos-Silva, J.

517,"Exoplanet surveys of evolved stars have provided increasing evidence that the formation of giant planets depends not only on stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]), but also the mass ($M_\star$). However, measuring accurate masses for subgiants and giants is far more challenging than it is for their main-sequence counterparts, which has led to recent concerns regarding the veracity of the correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence. In order to address these concerns we use HIRES spectra to perform a spectroscopic analysis on an sample of 245 subgiants and derive new atmospheric and physical parameters. We also calculate the space velocities of this sample in a homogeneous manner for the first time. When reddening corrections are considered in the calculations of stellar masses and a -0.12 M$_{\odot}$ offset is applied to the results, the masses of the subgiants are consistent with their space velocity distributions, contrary to claims in the literature. Similarly, our measurements of their rotational velocities provide additional confirmation that the masses of subgiants with $M_\star \geq 1.6$ M$_{\odot}$ (the ""Retired A Stars"") have not been overestimated in previous analyses. Using these new results for our sample of evolved stars, together with an updated sample of FGKM dwarfs, we confirm that giant planet occurrence increases with both stellar mass and metallicity up to 2.0 M$_{\odot}$. We show that the probability of formation of a giant planet is approximately a one-to-one function of the total amount of metals in the protoplanetary disk $M_\star 10^{[Fe/H]}$. This correlation provides additional support for the core accretion mechanism of planet formation.","Luan Ghezzi, Benjamin T. Montet, John Asher Johnson","Accepted for publication in ApJ.

518,"We revisit constraints on dark photons with masses below ~ 100 MeV from the observations of Supernova 1987A. If dark photons are produced in sufficient quantity, they reduce the amount of energy emitted in the form of neutrinos, in conflict with observations. For the first time, we include the effects of finite temperature and density on the kinetic-mixing parameter, epsilon, in this environment. This causes the constraints on epsilon to weaken with the dark-photon mass below ~ 15 MeV. For large-enough values of epsilon, it is well known that dark photons can be reabsorbed within the supernova. Since the rates of reabsorption processes decrease as the dark-photon energy increases, we point out that dark photons with energies above the Wien peak can escape without scattering, contributing more to energy loss than is possible assuming a blackbody spectrum. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic uncertainties on the cooling bounds by deriving constraints assuming one analytic and four different simulated temperature and density profiles of the proto-neutron star. Finally, we estimate also the systematic uncertainty on the bound by varying the distance across which dark photons must propagate from their point of production to be able to affect the star. This work clarifies the bounds from SN1987A on the dark-photon parameter space.","Jae Hyeok Chang, Rouven Essig, Samuel D.

Based on three-dimensional simulations for core-collapse and the corresponding gravitational-wave waveform emitted, the corresponding detection range for these waveforms is limited to within our galaxy even in the era of third-generation detectors. The corresponding event rate is two per century. We find from the waveforms that to detect core-collapse supernovae with an event rate of one per year, the gravitational-wave detectors need a strain sensitivity of 3$\times10^{-27}~$Hz$^{-1/2}$ in a frequency range from 100~Hz to 1500~Hz.

520,"Recent observations of the solar photosphere revealed the presence of elongated filamentary bright structures inside sunspot umbrae, called umbral filaments (UFs). These features differ in morphology, magnetic configuration, and evolution from light bridges that are usually observed to intrude in sunspots. To characterize an UF observed in the umbra of the giant leading sunspot of active region NOAA 12529, we analyze high-resolution observations taken in the photosphere with the spectropolarimeter aboard the Hinode satellite and in the upper chromosphere and transition region with the IRIS telescope. The results of this analysis definitely rule out the hypothesis that the UF might be a kind of light bridge. In fact, we find no field-free or low-field strength region cospatial to the UF. Conversely, we recognize the presence of a strong horizontal field larger than 2500 G, a significant portion of the UF with opposite polarity with respect to the surroundings, and filaments in the upper atmospheric layers corresponding to the UF in the photosphere. These findings suggest that this structure is the photospheric manifestation of a flux rope hanging above the sunspot and forming penumbral-like filaments within the umbra via magneto-convection. This reinforces a previously proposed scenario.","S. L. Guglielmino, P. Romano, B. Ruiz Cobo, F. Zuccarello, M. Murabito","16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for ApJ; some figures are presented in

521,"We consider black hole - galaxy coevolution using simple analytic arguments. We focus on the fact that several supermassive black holes are known with masses significantly larger than suggested by the $M - {\sigma}$ relation, sometimes also with rather small stellar masses. We show that these are likely to have descended from extremely compact `blue nugget' galaxies born at high redshift, whose very high velocity dispersions allowed the black holes to reach unusually large masses. Subsequent interactions reduce the velocity dispersion, so the black holes lie above the usual $M - {\sigma}$ relation and expel a large fraction of the bulge gas (as in WISE J104222.11+164115.3) that would otherwise make stars, before ending at low redshift as very massive holes in galaxies with relatively low stellar masses, such as NGC 4889 and NGC 1600. We further suggest the possible existence of two new types of galaxy: low-mass dwarfs whose central black holes lie below the $M - {\sigma}$ relation at low redshift, and galaxies consisting of very massive ($\gtrsim 10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$) black holes with extremely small stellar masses.

522,"This paper is the third of a series in which we investigate the discrimination between Gaussian (G) and Non-Gaussian (NG) clusters, based on the velocity distribution of the member galaxies. We study a sample of 177 groups from the Yang catalog in the redshift interval of 0.03 $\le$ z $\le$ 0.1 and masses $\ge$ 10$^{14} \rm M_{\odot}$. Examining the projected stellar mass density distributions of G and NG groups we find strong evidence of a higher infall rate in the outskirts of NG groups over the G ones. There is a 61\% excess of faint galaxies in NGs when contrasted with G groups, when integrating $\rm from ~ 0.8 ~to~ 2.0R/R_{200}$. The study of the Star Formation History (SFH) of ellipticals and spirals in the three main regions of the Projected Phase Space (PPS) reveals also that the star formation in faint spirals of NG groups is significantly different from their counterpart in the G groups. The assembled mass for Faint spirals varies from 59\% at 12.7 Gyr to 75\% at 8.0 Gyr, while in G systems this variation is from 82\% to 91\%. This finding may also be interpreted as a higher infall rate of gas rich systems in NG groups. This accretion process through the filaments, disturbing the velocity distribution and modifying not only the stellar population of the incoming galaxies but also their SFH, should be seriously considered in modelling galaxy evolution.","R.

524,"We report Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of four high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxy candidates selected from far-Infrared (FIR)/submm observations in the COSMOS field. We securely detect all galaxies in the continuum and spectroscopically confirm them at z=3.62--5.85 using ALMA 3mm line scans, detecting multiple CO and/or [CI] transitions. This includes the most distant dusty galaxy currently known in the COSMOS field, ID85001929 at z=5.847. These redshifts are lower than we had expected as these galaxies have substantially colder dust temperatures than most literature sources at z>4. We provide direct evidence that, given their cold spectral energy distributions, CMB plays a significant role biasing their observed Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes to unlikely steep values and, possibly, reducing their CO fluxes by a factor of two. We recover standard RJ slopes when the CMB contribution is taken into account. High resolution ALMA imaging shows compact morphology and evidence for mergers. This work reveals a population of cold dusty star-forming galaxies that were under-represented in current surveys, and are even colder than typical Main Sequence galaxies at the same redshift. The observed cold dust temperatures could be a result of low star formation efficiency with rapid metal enrichment or, more likely, evidence for optically thick dust continuum in the FIR. High FIR dust optical depth might be a widespread feature of compact starbursts at any redshift.","S. Jin, E. Daddi, G. E. Magdis, D. Liu, E. Schinnerer, P. P. Papadopoulos, Q. Gu, Y. Gao, A.

526,"In this work we have investigated the dynamics of a recent modification to the general theory of relativity, the energy-momentum squared gravity model $f(R,\mathbf{T^2})$, where $R$ represents the scalar curvature and $\mathbf{T^2}$ the square of the energy-momentum tensor. By using dynamical system analysis for various types of gravity functions $f(R,\mathbf{T^2})$, we have studied the structure of the phase space and the physical implications of the energy--momentum squared coupling. In the first case of functional where $f(R,\mathbf{T^2})=f_0 R^n(\mathbf{T^2})^m$, with $f_0$ constant, we have shown that the phase space structure has a reduced complexity, with a high sensitivity to the values of the $m$ and $n$ parameters. Depending on the values of the $m$ and $n$ parameters, the model exhibits various cosmological epochs, corresponding to matter eras, solutions associated to an accelerated expansion, or decelerated periods. The second model studied corresponds to the $f(R,\mathbf{T^2})=\alpha R^n+\beta\mathbf{(T^2)}^m$ form with $\alpha, \beta$ constant parameters. In this case it is obtained a richer phase space structure which can recover different cosmological scenarios, associated to matter eras, de--Sitter solutions, and dark energy epochs. Hence, this model represent an interesting cosmological model which can explain the current evolution of the Universe and the emergence of the accelerated expansion as a geometrical consequence.","Sebastian Bahamonde, Mihai Marciu, Prabir Rudra","16 pages, 12 figures",1906.00027v1,No journal ref found,Prabir Rudra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00027v1,2019-05-31 18:36:04+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,Dynamical system analysis of generalized energy-momentum-squared gravity,2019-05-31 18:36:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00027v1
527,"We present numerical simulations of giant planet migration in our solar system and examine how the speed of planetary migration affects inclinations in the resulting population of small bodies (test particles) scattered outward and subsequently captured into Neptune's 3:2 mean motion resonance (the Plutinos) as well as the hot classical Kuiper belt population. We do not find a consistent relationship between the degree of test particle inclination excitation and e-folding planet migration timescales in the range 5-50 Myr. Our results present a counter-example to Nesvorny 2015's finding that the Plutino and hot classical inclinations showed a marked increase with increasing e-folding timescales for Neptune's migration. We argue that these differing results are likely due to differing secular architectures of the giant planets during and after migration. Small changes in the planets' initial conditions and differences in the numerical implementation of planet migration can result in different amplitudes of the planets' inclination secular modes, and this can lead to different final inclination distributions for test particles in the simulations. We conclude that the observed large inclination dispersion of Kuiper belt objects does not require Neptune's migration to be slow; planetary migration with e-folding timescales of 5, 10, 30, and 50 Myr can all yield inclination dispersions similar to the observed Plutino and hot classical populations, with no correlation between the degree of inclination excitation and migration speed.","Kathryn Volk, Renu Malhotra",accepted for publication in AJ,1906.00023v1,No journal ref found,Renu Malhotra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00023v1,2019-05-31 18:24:34+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Not a simple relationship between Neptune's migration speed and Kuiper   belt inclination excitation,2019-05-31 18:24:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00023v1
528,"It has been suggested that the absence of macroturbulence in the atmosphere of NGC 1624 - 2 is due its strong magnetic field (the strongest known for a massive O star) suppressing convection in its outer layers, removing the mechanism thought responsible for the observed macroturbulence in stars with lower field strengths. Here, we develop and apply a criterion for a uniform magnetic field to suppress convection in stellar envelopes in which radiation pressure is a significant contributor to hydrostatic balance. We find upper mass limits of ~55 Msun and ~30 Msun for magnetic suppression to be possible in Zero Age Main Sequence and Terminal Age Main Sequence stars, respectively. For evolved stars, magnetic suppression of convection can significantly alter the stars' evolution. For NGC 1624 - 2, we find a polar dipole strength of 16.5 +/- 5.9 kG is required to suppress convection, in good agreement with the value ~20 kG measured by spectropolarimetry.","James MacDonald, Véronique Petit",To appear in MNRAS,1906.00019v1,No journal ref found,Véronique Petit,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00019v1,2019-05-31 18:10:38+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Magnetic inhibition of convection in O star envelopes,2019-05-31 18:10:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00019v1

530,"X-ray polarimetry in astronomy has not been exploited well, despite its importance. The recent innovation of instruments is changing this situation. We focus on a complementary MOS (CMOS) pixel detector with small pixel size and employ it as an x-ray photoelectron tracking polarimeter. The CMOS detector we employ is developed by GPixel Inc., and has a pixel size of 2.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. Although it is designed for visible light, we succeed in detecting x-ray photons with an energy resolution of 176 eV (FWHM) at 5.9 keV at room temperature and the atmospheric condition. We measure the x-ray detection efficiency and polarimetry sensitivity by irradiating polarized monochromatic x-rays at BL20B2 in SPring-8, the synchrotron radiation facility in Japan. We obtain modulation factors of 7.63% $\pm$ 0.07% and 15.5% $\pm$ 0.4% at 12.4 keV and 24.8 keV, respectively.

531,"We perform long-term simulations of spinning binary neutron stars, with our highest dimensionless spin being $\chi \sim 0.32$. To assess the importance of spin during the inspiral we vary the spin, and also use two equations of state, one that consists of plain nuclear matter and produces compact stars (SLy), and a hybrid one that contains both nuclear and quark matter and leads to larger stars (ALF2). Using high resolution that has grid spacing $\Delta x\sim 98$ m on the finest refinement level, we find that the effects of spin in the phase evolution of a binary system can be larger than the one that comes from tidal forces. Our calculations demonstrate explicitly that although tidal effects are dominant for small spins ($\lesssim 0.1$), this is no longer true when the spins are larger, but still much smaller than the Keplerian limit.","Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Vasileios Paschalidis, Stuart L.

532,"If the dark matter is part of a hidden sector with only very feeble couplings to the Standard Model, the lightest particle in the hidden sector will generically be long-lived and could come to dominate the energy density of the universe prior to the onset of nucleosynthesis. During this early matter-dominated era, density perturbations will grow more quickly than otherwise predicted, leading to a large abundance of sub-earth-mass dark matter microhalos. Since the dark matter does not couple directly to the Standard Model, the minimum halo mass is much smaller than expected for weakly interacting dark matter, and the smallest halos could form during the radiation-dominated era. In this paper, we calculate the evolution of density perturbations within the context of such hidden sector models and use a series of $N$-body simulations to determine the outcome of nonlinear collapse during radiation domination. The resulting microhalos are extremely dense, which leads to very high rates of dark matter annihilation and to large indirect detection signals that resemble those ordinarily predicted for decaying dark matter. We find that the Fermi Collaboration's measurement of the high-latitude gamma-ray background rules out a wide range of parameter space within this class of models. The scenarios that are most difficult to constrain are those that feature a very long early matter-dominated era; if microhalos form prior to the decay of the unstable hidden sector matter, the destruction of these microhalos effectively heats the dark matter, suppressing the later formation of microhalos.","Carlos Blanco, M.

533,"The most metal-poor, high redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) provide a window to study some of the first few generations of stars. In this paper, we present a novel model to investigate the chemical enrichment of the near-pristine DLA population. This model accounts for the mass distribution of the enriching stellar population, the typical explosion energy of their supernovae, and the average number of stars that contribute to the enrichment of these DLAs. We conduct a maximum likelihood analysis of these model parameters using the observed relative element abundances ([C/O], [Si/O], and [Fe/O]) of the 11 most metal-poor DLAs currently known. We find that the mass distribution of the stars that have enriched this sample of metal-poor DLAs can be well-described by a Salpeter-like IMF slope at M > 10 M_sun and that a typical metal-poor DLA has been enriched by < 72 massive stars (95% confidence), with masses < 40 M_sun. The inferred typical explosion energy (E_exp = 1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2}x10^51 erg) is somewhat lower than that found by recent works that model the enrichment of metal-poor halo stars. These constraints suggest that some of the metal-poor DLAs in our sample may have been enriched by Population II stars. Using our enrichment model, we also infer some of the typical physical properties of the most metal-poor DLAs. We estimate that the total stellar mass content is log10(M_*/M_sun) = 3.5^{+0.3}_{-0.4} and the total gas mass is log10(M_gas/M_sun) = 7.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4} for systems with a relative oxygen abundance [O/H] ~ -3.0.","Louise Welsh, Ryan Cooke, Michele Fumagalli","15 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of

534,"This paper reports the discovery of spatially-extended line-emitting nebula, reaching to ~100 physical kpc (pkpc) from a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA) at z_DLA=0.313 along the sightline toward QSO PKS1127-145 (z_QSO=1.188). This DLA was known to be associated with a galaxy group of dynamical mass M_group ~3e12 M_sun, but its physical origin remained ambiguous. New wide-field integral field observations revealed a giant nebula detected in [OII], H{\beta}, [OIII], H{\alpha}, and [NII] emission, with the line-emitting gas following closely the motions of group galaxies. One of the denser streams passes directly in front of the QSO with kinematics consistent with the absorption profiles recorded in the QSO echelle spectra. The emission morphology, kinematics, and line ratios of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a result of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the ambient hot medium, contribute significantly to the ionization of the gas. While the DLA may not be associated with any specific detected member of the group, both the kinematic and dust properties are consistent with the DLA originating in streams of gas stripped from sub-L* group members at <~25 pkpc from the QSO sightline. This study demonstrates that gas stripping in low-mass galaxy groups is effective in releasing metal-enriched gas from star-forming regions, producing absorption systems in QSO spectra, and that combining absorption and emission-line observations provides an exciting new opportunity for studying gas and galaxy co-evolution.","Hsiao-Wen Chen, Erin Boettcher, Sean D.

535,"I propose a new approach to free-form cluster lens modeling that is inspired by the JPEG image compression method. This approach is motivated specifically by the need for accurate modeling of high-magnification regions in galaxy clusters. Existing modeling methods may struggle in these regions due to their limited flexibility in the parametrization of the lens, even for a wide variety of free-form methods. This limitation especially hinders the characterization of faint galaxies at high redshifts, which have important implications for the formation of the first galaxies and even for the nature of dark matter. JPEG images are extremely accurate representations of their original, uncompressed counterparts but use only a fraction of number of parameters to represent that information. Its relevance is immediately obvious to cluster lens modeling. Using this technique, it is possible to construct flexible models that are capable of accurately reproducing the true mass distribution using only a small number of free parameters. Transferring this well-proven technology to cluster lens modeling, I demonstrate that this `JPEG parametrization' is indeed flexible enough to accurately approximate an N-body simulated cluster.",Daniel Lam,"7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PASP",1906.00006v1,No journal ref found,Daniel Lam,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00006v1,2019-05-31 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.IM,A New Approach to Free-Form Cluster Lens Modeling Inspired by the JPEG   Image Compression Method,2019-05-31 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00006v1
536,"The formation and assembly process of massive galaxies is a combination of two phases: an initial in-situ-dominated one followed by an ex-situ-dominated evolution. Separating these two contributions is therefore crucial to understand the baryonic cycle within massive halos. A recently discovered population of so-called naked red nuggets, galaxies that shortcut the ex-situ stage preserving their pristine properties, presents a unique opportunity to study in detail star formation in massive galaxies without the confounding effect of later accretion. We investigate the spatially resolved star formation histories of a sample of 12 naked red nuggets. We measure how their radial light distributions, star formation rates and central densities evolved in time. We find that, while forming stars, red nuggets become gradually more concentrated, reaching a maximum concentration at quenching. After being quenched, they kept forming stars in a more disky-like configuration. Our measurements suggest that super-massive black holes and host galaxies grow their mass in a self-regulated way until a characteristic Mbh/Mhalo is reached. Once black holes are massive enough, red nuggets get quenched and depart from the star formation main sequence. While in the main sequence, red nuggets evolve at roughly constant star formation rate. This can explain up to ~0.3 dex of the scatter of the star formation main sequence, as well as its higher normalization observed in the early Universe. Hence, our results suggest that the main sequence is composed of populations of galaxies at different evolutionary stages, and that the scatter is therefore due to secular processes.","Ignacio Martín-Navarro, Glenn van de Ven, Akın Yıldırım","Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 13 pages, 8 figures.

When dark matter has spin-independent couplings to atoms or ions, it has been shown to efficiently excite phonons. Here we show that, if dark matter couples to the electron spin, magnon excitations in materials with magnetic dipole order offer a promising detection path. We derive general formulae for single magnon excitation rates from dark matter scattering, and demonstrate as a proof of principle the projected reach of a yttrium iron garnet target for several dark matter models with spin-dependent interactions. This highlights the complementarity of various collective excitations in probing different dark matter interactions.","Tanner Trickle, Zhengkang Zhang, Kathryn M.

539,"We explore the impact of pulsar electromagnetic dipole and fallback accretion emission on the luminosity of a suite of kilonova models. The pulsar models are varied over pulsar magnetic field strength, pulsar lifetime, ejecta mass, and elemental abundances; the fallback models are varied over fallback accretion rate and ejecta mass. For the abundances, we use Fe and Nd as representatives of the wind and dynamical ejecta, respectively. We simulate radiative transfer in the ejecta in either 1D spherical or 2D cylindrical spatial geometry. For the grid of 1D simulations, the mass fraction of Nd is 0, $10^{-4}$, or $10^{-3}$ and the rest is Fe. Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution. Further exploration of the parameter space and model deficiencies is needed before we can describe AT 2017gfo with a remnant source.","Ryan T. Wollaeger, Chris L. Fryer, Christopher J.

540,"We present the first realistic 3D simulations of flame front instabilities during type I X-ray bursts. The unperturbed front is characterised by the balance between the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force of a spinning neutron star ({\nu} = 450 Hz in our case). This balance leads to a fast horizontal velocity field parallel to the flame front. This flow is strongly sheared in the vertical direction. When we perturb the front an instability quickly corrugates the front. We identify this instability as the baroclinic instability. Most importantly, the flame is not disrupted by the instability and there are two major consequences: the overall flame propagation speed is {\sim} 10 times faster than in the unperturbed case and distinct flame vortices appear. The speedup is due to the corrugation of the front and the dynamics of the vortices. These vortices may also be linked to the oscillations observed in the lightcurves of the bursts.","Yuri Cavecchi, Anatoly Spitkovsky",No comment found,1905.13735v1,No journal ref found,Anatoly Spitkovsky,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13735v1,2019-05-31 17:39:50+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Three-dimensional instability of flame fronts in type I X-ray bursts,2019-05-31 17:39:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13735v1
541,"The exact time-dependent solution is obtained for a magnetic field growth during a spherically symmetric accretion into a black hole (BH) with a Schwarzschild metric. Magnetic field is increasing with time, changing from the initially uniform into a quasi-radial field. Equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies in the falling gas is established in the developed stages of the flow. Estimates of the synchrotron radiation intensity are presented for the stationary flow. The main part of the radiation is formed in the region $r \leq 7 r_g$, here $r_g$ is a BH gravitational radius. The two-dimensional stationary self-similar magnetohydrodynamic solution is obtained for the matter accretion into BH, in a presence of a large-scale magnetic field, when the magnetic field far from the BH is homogeneous and does not influence the flow. At the symmetry plane perpendicular to the direction of the distant magnetic field, the quasi-stationary disk is formed around BH, which structure is determined by dissipation processes. Parameters of the shock forming due to matter infall onto the disk are obtained. The radiation spectrum of the disk and the shock are obtained for the $10\,\, M_\odot$ BH. The luminosity of such object is about the solar one, for a characteristic galactic gas density, with possibility of observation at distances less than 1 kpc. The spectra of a laminar and a turbulent disk structure around BH are very different. The turbulent disk emits a large part of its flux in the infrared. It may occur that some of the galactic infrared star-like sources are a single BH in the turbulent accretion state. The radiative efficiency of the magnetized disk is very high, reaching $\sim 0.5\,\dot M\,c^2$ so it was called recently as a magnetically arrested disk (MAD).

542,"The first two months of the third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run (2019 April-May) showed that distant gravitational wave (GW) events can now be readily detected, with three neutron star (NS) mergers more than 100 Mpc away reported in a span of just 15 days.

543,"In order to clarify the tension between estimates of the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) from local ($z \ll 1$) and global ($z \gg 1$) measurements, Lima and Cunha (LC) proposed a new method to measure $H_0$ in intermediate redshifts ($z \approx 1$), which were obtained $H_0 = 74.1 \pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1} $Mpc$^{-1}$ ($1 \sigma$), in full agreement to local measurements via Supernovae/Cepheid dataset. However, Holanda \textit{et al.} (2014) affirm that a better understanding of the morphology of galaxy clusters in LC framework is needed to a more robust and accurate determination of $H_0$. Moreover, that kind of sample has been strongly questioned in the literature. In this context, (i) we investigated if the sample of galaxy clusters used by LC has a relevant role in their results, then (ii) we perform a more accurate and competitive determination of $H_0$ in intermediate redshifts, free of unknown systematic uncertainties. First, we found that the exclusion of the sample of galaxy clusters from the determination initially proposed by LC leads to significantly different results. Finally, we performed a new determination in $H_0$, where we obtained $H_0 = 68.00 \pm 2.20$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($1 \sigma$) with statistical and systematic errors and $H_0 = 68.71^{+1.37}_{-1.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($1 \sigma$) with statistical errors only.

544,"We revisit the estimate of cosmic opacity to ultra-high energy (UHE) $\gamma$ rays ($E>10^{18}$ eV) considering, besides the $\gamma \gamma \to e^+e^-$ and $\gamma \gamma \to e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$ processes, the production of other leptons ($l$) and quarks ($q$). The most important channels are those leading to the production of light $q\bar{q}$ ($q=u,d$) followed by hadronization and $\mu^{\pm}$, while the production of $\tau^{\pm}$ and $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$ followed by hadronization are subdominant. We consider also the single neutral meson production but it does not play a significant role. We recalculate the optical depth by considering all these processes, and we find that at UHE absorption is currently underestimated. For a distance $\simeq 130$ Mpc (approximately equal to the GZK radius) the photon survival probability is smaller by about one order of magnitude with respect to the current estimates.","Giorgio Galanti, Fabrizio Tavecchio, Fulvio Piccinini, Marco Roncadelli","9 pages, 4 figures",1905.13713v1,No journal ref found,Marco Roncadelli,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13713v1,2019-05-31 16:46:28+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|hep-ph,Revisiting $γγ$ absorption for UHE photons with $l\bar{l}$ and   $q\bar{q}$ production,2019-05-31 16:46:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13713v1
545,"Outflows produced by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can have important feedback effects in its host galaxy. An unresolved question is the nature and properties of winds from SMBHs accreting at low rates in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). We performed two-dimensional numerical, hydrodynamical simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto non spinning black holes. We explored a diversity of initial conditions in terms of rotation curves and viscous shear stress prescriptions, and evolved our models for very long durations of up to $8 \times 10^5 GM/c^3$. Our models resulted in powerful subrelativistic, thermally-driven winds originated from the corona of the accretion flow at distances $10-100 GM/c^2$ from the SMBH. The winds reached velocities of up to $0.01 c$ with kinetic powers corresponding to 0.1-1% of the rest-mass energy associated with inflowing gas at large distances, in good agreement with models of the ``radio mode'' of AGN feedback. The properties of our simulated outflows are in broad agreement with observations of winds in quiescent galaxies that host LLAGNs, which are capable of heating ambient gas and suppressing star formation.","Ivan Almeida, Rodrigo Nemmen","21 pages , 16 figures.

546,"The three-point correlation function (3PCF) of the 21cm brightness temperature from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) probes complementary information to the commonly studied two-point correlation function (2PCF) about the morphology of ionized regions. We investigate the 21cm 2PCF and 3PCF in configuration space using semi-numerical simulations and test whether they can be described by the local quadratic bias model. We find that fits of bias model predictions for the 2PCF and 3PCF deviate from our measurements by $\sim 20\%$ at scales above the typical size of ionized regions ($\simeq 30$ Mpc) and at early times with global neutral fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \gtrsim 0.7$. At later times and smaller scales these deviations increase strongly, indicating a break down of the bias model. The 2PCF and 3PCF fits of the linear bias parameter agree at the $10\%$ level for different EoR model configurations. This agreement holds, when adding redshift space distortions to the simulations. The relation between spatial fluctuations in the matter density and the 21cm signal, as predicted by the bias model, is consistent with direct measurements of this relation in simulations for large smoothing scales ($\gtrsim 30$ Mpc). From this latter test we conclude that negative amplitudes of the 21cm 3PCF result from negative bias parameters, which describe the anti-correlation between the matter over-densities and the 21cm signal during the EoR. However, a more detailed interpretation of the bias parameters may require a description of non-local contributions to the bias model.","Kai Hoffmann, Yi Mao, Jiachuan Xu, Houjun Mo, Benjamin D.

547,"In supernovae neutrinos are emitted from a region with a width $r_{\rm eff}$ of a few kilometres (rather than from a surface of infinitesimal width). We study the effect of integration (averaging) over such an extended emission region on collective oscillations. The averaging leads to additional suppression of the correlation (off-diagonal element of the density matrix) by a factor $\sim 1/r_{\rm eff} V_e \sim 10^{-10}$ where $V_e$ is the matter potential. This factor enters the initial condition for further collective oscillations and, consequently, leads to a delay of the strong flavour transitions. We justify and quantify this picture using a simple example of collective effects in two intersecting fluxes. We have derived the evolution equation for the density matrix elements integrated over the emission region and solved it both numerically and analytically. For the analytic solution we have used linearised equations. We show that the delay of the development of the instability and the collective oscillations depends on the suppression factor due to the averaging (integration) logarithmically. If the instability develops inside the production region, the integration leads not only to a delay but also to a modification of the exponential grow.","Rasmus S. L. Hansen, Alexei Yu.

548,"We study surface effects of neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids in neutron stars. $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids are in uniaxial nematic (UN), D$_{2}$ biaxial nematic (BN), or D$_{4}$ BN phase, depending on the strength of magnetic fields from small to large. We suppose a neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid in a ball facing to the boundary at the surface sphere. Adopting a suitable boundary condition for $^{3}P_{2}$ condensates, we solve the Ginzburg-Landau equation to find several surface properties for the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid. First, the phase on the surface can be different from that of the bulk, and symmetry restoration/breaking occurs in general on the surface. Second, the distribution of the surface energy density has an anisotropy depending on the polar angle in the sphere, which may lead to the deformation of the geometrical shape of the surface. Third, the order parameter manifold (OPM) induced on the surface, which is described by two-dimensional vector fields induced on the surface from the condensates, allows topological defects (vortices) on the surface, and there must exist such defects even in the ground state thanks to the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem: although the numbers of the vortices and anti-vortices depend on the bulk phases, the difference between them are topologically invariant (the Euler number $\chi=2$) irrespective to the bulk phases. These vortices which are not extended to the bulk are called boojums in the context of liquid crystals and helium-3 superfluids. The surface properties of the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid found in this paper may provide us useful information to study neutron stars.","Shigehiro Yasui, Chandrasekhar Chatterjee, Muneto Nitta","30 pages, 11 figures",1905.13666v1,No journal ref found,Muneto Nitta,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13666v1,2019-05-31 15:11:09+00:00,nucl-th,nucl-th|astro-ph.HE|cond-mat.supr-con|hep-th,Symmetry and topology of the boundary of neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids   in neutron stars: boojums as surface topological defects,2019-05-31 15:11:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13666v1

This is the largest dataset of newly confirmed PSZ2 sources without any previous optical information. All the confirmed counterparts are rich structures (i.e. they show high velocity dispersion), and are well aligned with the nominal Planck coordinates (~70% of them are located at less than 3 arcmin distance). In total, 65 SZ sources are classified as unconfirmed, being 57 of them due to the absence of an optical over-density, and 8 of them due to a weak association with the observed SZ decrement. Most of the sources with no optical counterpart are located at low galactic latitudes and present strong galactic cirrus in the optical images, being the dust contamination the most probable explanation for their inclusion in the PSZ2 catalogue.","A.

Considering as case study Horndeski theories with the speed of gravitational waves equal to that of light, we show how constraints on the free parameters and the large-scale structure phenomenological functions can be improved by two ingredients: firstly by complementing the set of redshift-space distortions data with the three recent measurements of the growth rate $f$ and the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations; secondly by applying a local Solar System bound on the variation of the Newton constant. This analysis allows us to conclude that: $i)$ despite firmly restricting the predictions of weaker gravity, the inclusion of the Solar System bound does not prevent suppressed growth relative to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts; $ii)$ the same bound in conjunction with the growth of structure data strongly restricts the redshift evolution of the gravitational slip parameter to be close to unity and the present value is constrained to one at the $10^{-3}$ level; $iii)$ the growth of structure data favours a fifth force contribution to the effective gravitational coupling at low redshifts and at more than one sigma at present time.","Louis Perenon, Julien Bel, Roy Maartens, Alvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz",Accepted for publication in JCAP,1901.11063v2,No journal ref found,Alvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11063v2,2019-01-30 19:32:39+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Optimising growth of structure constraints on modified gravity,2019-05-31 14:48:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11063v2

552,"In an effort to better understand collisionless relaxation processes in gravitational systems, we investigate one-dimensional models. Taking advantage of a Hermite-Legendre expansion of relevant distribution functions, we present analytical and numerical behaviors of Maxwell-Boltzmann entropy. In particular, we modestly perturb systems about a separable-solution equilibrium and observe their collisionless evolution to a steady state. We verify the time-independence of fine-grained entropy in these systems before turning our attention to the behavior of coarse-grained entropy. We also verify that there is no analogue to the collisional H-theorem for these systems. Competing terms in the second-order coarse-grained entropy make it impossible to guarantee continuously increasing entropy. However, over dynamical time-scales the coarse-grained entropy generally increases, with small oscillations occurring. The lack of substantive differences between the entropies in test-particle and self-gravitating cases suggests that phase mixing, rather than violent relaxation associated with potential changes, more significantly drives the coarse-grained entropy evolution. The effects of violent relaxation can be better quantified through analysis of energy distributions rather than phase-space distributions.","Eric I. Barnes, Robert J.

553,"Recent dynamical models of Solar System evolution and isotope studies of rock-forming elements in meteorites have suggested that volatile-rich asteroids formed in the outer Solar System beyond Jupiter's orbit, despite being currently located in the main asteroid belt. The ambient temperature under which asteroids formed is a crucial diagnostic to pinpoint the original location of asteroids and is potentially determined by the abundance of volatiles they contain. In particular, abundances and 13C/12C ratios of carbonates in meteorites record the abundances of carbon-bearing volatile species in their parent asteroids. However, the sources of carbon for these carbonates remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Tagish Lake meteorite contains abundant carbonates with consistently high 13C/12C ratios. The high abundance of 13C-rich carbonates in Tagish Lake excludes organic matter as their main carbon source. Therefore, the Tagish Lake parent body, presumably a D-type asteroid, must have accreted a large amount of 13C-rich CO2 ice. The estimated 13C/12C and CO2/H2O ratios of ice in Tagish Lake are similar to those of cometary ice. Thus, we infer that at least some D-type asteroids formed in the cold outer Solar System and were subsequently transported into the inner Solar System owing to an orbital instability of the giant planets.","Wataru Fujiya, Peter Hoppe, Takayuki Ushikubo, Kohei Fukuda, Paula Lindgren, Martin R.

This provides an important component for understanding the physics involved in the relaxation of these kinds of systems. As the dark matter structures in the universe should have traits in common with these systems, insight into this relaxation can provide clues to larger astrophysical questions. For large perturbation strengths, we determine physically motivated parameter ranges for the simplest families of steady states as well as their stability. We also demonstrate that any set of initial conditions in the linear regime can be resolved into unique time-independent and time-dependent modes. Combinations of time-independent modes then describe the steady state of any system linearly perturbed from equilibrium. These results highlight the importance of initial conditions over relaxation mechanisms in the evolution of these systems.","Robert J. Ragan, Eric I.

555,"The QCD axion serves as a well-motivated dark matter candidate and the misalignment mechanism is known to reproduce the observed abundance with a decay constant $f_a \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{12})$ GeV for a misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm mis} \simeq \mathcal{O}(1)$. While $f_a \ll 10^{12}$ GeV is of great experimental interest, the misalignment mechanism requires the axion to be very close to the hilltop, i.e. $\theta_{\rm mis} \simeq \pi$. This particular choice of $\theta_{\rm mis}$ has been understood as fine-tuning the initial condition. We offer a dynamical explanation for $\theta_{\rm mis} \simeq \pi$ in a class of models. The axion dynamically relaxes to the minimum of the potential by virtue of an enhanced mass in the early universe. This minimum is subsequently converted to a hilltop because the CP phase of the theory shifts by $\pi$ when one contribution becomes subdominant to another with an opposite sign. We demonstrate explicit and viable examples in supersymmetric models where the higher dimensional Higgs coupling with the inflaton naturally achieves both criteria. Associated phenomenology includes a strikingly sharp prediction of $3 \times 10^9$ GeV $\lesssim f_a \lesssim 10^{10}$ GeV and the absence of isocurvature perturbation.","Raymond T.

556,"Several theoretical motivations point to ultralight QCD axions with large decay constants $f_a \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{16}-10^{17})$ GeV, to which experimental proposals are dedicated. This regime is known to face the problem of overproduction of axion dark matter from the misalignment mechanism unless the misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm mis}$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$, which is generally considered a fine-tuning problem. We investigate a dynamical explanation for a small $\theta_{\rm mis}$. The axion mass arises from strong dynamics and may be sufficiently enhanced by early dynamics so as to overcome Hubble friction and drive the field value to the bottom of the potential long before the QCD phase transition. Together with an approximate CP symmetry in the theory, this minimum is very closely related to today's value and thus $\theta_{\rm mis}$ can automatically be well under unity. Owing to such efficient relaxation, the isocurvature perturbations are essentially damped. As an existence proof, using supersymmetric theories we illustrate that the Higgs coupling with the inflaton energy can successfully achieve this axion damping in a consistent inflationary cosmology.","Raymond T.

557,"CONTEXT. Claims of an X-shaped Galactic bulge were based on the assumption of red clump stars as standard candles in some lines of sight crossing the off-plane bulge. However, some doubts have been cast on whether the two peaks in star counts along the line of sight really represent a double peak in the density distribution, or whether there is something wrong with the assumption of a unique constant absolute magnitude for all of these stars.   AIMS. With the advent of Gaia-DR2 parallaxes in combination with near-infrared VISTA-VVV data, we are able to check which of the hypotheses is correct.   METHODS. We calculated the median absolute magnitude $M_K$ corresponding to both peaks of putative red clumps in seven lines of sight with the lowest extinction in the interesting coordinates' range.   RESULTS. The difference between the absolute magnitude of the bright and the faint peak is $\Delta M_K\approx 0.4$. The selected stars in both peaks cannot be represented by the same red clump giants with constant $M_K\approx -1.6$.   CONCLUSIONS. The hypothesis that the bulge contains an X-shape is based on the assumption that the faint and bright peaks of the density distribution towards the bulge are dominated by standard red clump stars. However, we show that both the faint and bright peaks cannot be dominated by standard red clump stars simultaneously.","M. Lopez-Corredoira, Y. -W. Lee, F. Garzon, D.

558,"The self coupling $\lambda$ of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model may show critical behavior, i.e. the Higgs potential may have a point at an energy scale $\sim 10^{17-18}$ GeV where both the first and second derivatives (almost) vanish. Since $\lambda$ is very small in this region, the Higgs boson can serve as inflaton even if its nonminimal coupling to the curvature scalar is only ${\cal O}(10)$, thereby alleviating concerns about the perturbative unitarity of the theory. We find that just before the Higgs as inflaton enters the flat region of the potential the usual slow--roll conditions are violated. This leads to ``overshooting'' behavior, which in turn strongly enhances scalar curvature perturbations because of the excitation of entropic (non--adiabatic) perturbations. For appropriate choice of the free parameters these large density perturbations occur at length scales relevant for the formation of primordial black holes. Even if these perturbations are not quite large enough to trigger copious black hole formation, they source second order tensor perturbations, i.e. primordial gravitational waves; the corresponding energy density can be detected by the proposed space-based gravitational wave detectors DECIGO and BBO.","Manuel Drees, Yong Xu","35 pages, 11 figures",1905.13581v1,No journal ref found,Yong Xu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13581v1,2019-05-31 12:43:04+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Critical Higgs Inflation and Second Order Gravitational Wave Signatures,2019-05-31 12:43:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13581v1

560,"The volume of data being collected in solar physics has exponentially increased over the past decade and with the introduction of the $\textit{Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope}$ (DKIST) we will be entering the age of petabyte solar data. Automated feature detection will be an invaluable tool for post-processing of solar images to create catalogues of data ready for researchers to use. We propose a deep learning model to accomplish this; a deep convolutional neural network is adept at feature extraction and processing images quickly. We train our network using data from $\textit{Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope}$ (SOT) H$\alpha$ images of a small subset of solar features with different geometries: filaments, prominences, flare ribbons, sunspots and the quiet Sun ($\textit{i.e.}$ the absence of any of the other four features). We achieve near perfect performance on classifying unseen images from SOT ($\approx$99.9\%) in 4.66 seconds. We also for the first time explore transfer learning in a solar context. Transfer learning uses pre-trained deep neural networks to help train new deep learning models $\textit{i.e.}$ it teaches a new model. We show that our network is robust to changes in resolution by degrading images from SOT resolution ($\approx$0.33$^{\prime \prime}$ at $\lambda$=6563\AA{}) to $\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly}$ (SDO/AIA) resolution ($\approx$1.2$^{\prime \prime}$) without a change in performance of our network.

In this regard and motivated by the important effect of massive graviton on the structure of white dwarfs we study the white dwarfs in Vegh's massive gravity which is known as one of theories of de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) like massive gravity. First, we consider the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory of massive gravity and solve it numerically by using the Chandrasekhar's equation of state. Our results show that the maximum mass of white dwarfs in massive gravity can be more than the Chandrasekhar limit ($M>1.45M_{\odot }$ ), and this result imposes some constraints on parameters of massive gravity. Then, we investigate the effects of various parameters on other properties of the white dwarfs such as mass-radius relation, mass-central density relation, Schwarzschild radius, average density and Kretschmann scalar. Next, we study dynamical stability condition for super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs and show that these massive compact objects enjoy dynamical stability. Finally, in order to have a better insight, we compare the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs with the obtained massive neutron stars in dRGT like massive theory of gravity.","B. Eslam Panah, H. L.

562,"We present results obtained from the studies of magnetic activities on four solar-type stars (F-type star KIC 6791060, K-type star LO Peg, and two M-type planet-hosting stars K2-33 and EPIC 211901114) by using optical observations from several ground- and space-based telescopes. In this study, we investigate magnetic activities such as spot-topographic evolution and flaring events in these stars. We compare the results obtained from this study with that of the Sun. In the surface temperature maps, one active longitude has been detected in KIC 6791060, whereas in each of the other three cases two active longitudes are seen. The spottedness was found to vary in the range of 0.07--0.44%, 9--26%, 3.6--4.2%, and 4.5--5.3% for KIC 6791060, LO Peg, K2-33, and EPIC 211901114, respectively. Several flaring events have been identified in each star. An increasing trend in flaring frequency per stellar rotation has been found in the stars with a change in spectral type from F to M. These findings indicate the increase in magnetic activities with the spectral type of stars. This can be explained due to increasing the ratio of the thickness of the convection zone to the radiation zone from F-type star to the M-type stars.","Subhajeet Karmakar, Jeewan C.

563,"Gaseous halos play a key role for understanding inflow, feedback and the overall baryon budget in galaxies. Literature models predict transitions of the state of the gaseous halo between cold and hot accretion, winds, fountains and hydrostatic halos at certain galaxy masses. Since luminosities of radio AGN are sensitive to halo densities, any significant transition would be expected to show up in the radio luminosities of large samples of galaxies. The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) has indeed identified a galaxy stellar mass scale, $10^{11} M_\odot$ , above which the radio luminosities increase disproportionately. Here, we investigate, if radio luminosities of galaxies, especially the marked rise at galaxy masses around $10^{11} M_\odot$, can be explained with standard assumptions on jet powers, scaling between black hole-mass and galaxy mass and gaseous halos. We developed models for the radio luminosity of radio AGN in halos under infall, galactic wind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical constraints, and compared it to LoTSS data for a large sample of galaxies in the mass rangebetween $10^{8.5} M_\odot$ and $10^{12} M_\odot$. Assuming the same characteristic upper limit to jet powers as is known from high galaxy masses to hold at all masses, we find that the maximum radio luminosities for the hydrostatic gas halos fit well with the upper envelope of the distribution of the LOFAR data. The marked rise in radio luminosity at $10^{11} M_\odot$ is matched in our model, and is related to significant change in halo gas density around this galaxy mass, which is a consequence of the lower cooling rates at higher virial temperature. Wind and infall models overpredict the radio luminosities at small galaxy masses and have no particular steepening of the run of the radio luminosities predicted at any galaxy mass. [...]","Martin G.

Depending on the astrophysical scenario, the sources of asymmetry may have thermal, viscous, elastic and/or magnetic origin.

The procedure denoted as \texttt{Followup} implements matched-filtering $\mathcal{F}$-statistic method. We describe data analysis methods and algorithms used in the procedure. We present tests of the \texttt{Followup} for artificial signals added to white, Gaussian noise. The tests show a good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

565,"The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of reionization Signature (EDGES) collaboration has reported an excess absorption dip in the 21 cm signal during cosmic dawn era. The stronger than expected 21 absorption signal indicates that gas was much cooler than the standard cosmological prediction. The observed 21-cm signal can be explained by decreasing the gas temperature via baryon-DM interaction. In this work, we study the temperature evolution of the gas and Dark Matter (DM) in the presence of magnetic fields. The magnetic heating via ambipolar diffusion and the turbulent decay increases both the gas and DM temperature at low redshift and this heating is more in the favour of baryons compared to DM. In the presence of strong magnetic field, a large baryon-DM interaction cross section is required to balance magnetic heating to explain the EDGES signal as compared to weak magnetic field. We also study the brightness temperature during the cosmic dawn era and put constraint on the strength of the magnetic field for a particular mass and baryon-DM cross section.","Jitesh R.

566,"X-ray radiation from accreting compact objects is an important part of stellar feedback. The metal-poor galaxy ESO 338-4 has experienced vigorous starburst during the last 40 Myr and contains some of the most massive super star clusters in the nearby Universe. Given its starburst age and its star-formation rate, ESO 338-4 is one of the most efficient nearby manufactures of neutron stars and black holes, hence providing an excellent laboratory for feedback studies. We compared X-ray images and spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and Chandra telescopes with integral field spectroscopic VLT MUSE observations in the optical to constrain the nature of strong X-ray emitters. X-ray observations uncover three ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in ESO 338-4. The brightest among them, ESO 338~X-1, has X-ray luminosity in excess of 10^{40} erg/s. We speculate that ESO 338-4 is powered by accretion on an intermediate-mass (~300Msun) black hole. We show that X-ray radiation from ULXs and hot superbubbles strongly contributes to HeII ionization and general stellar feedback in this template starburst galaxy.","Lidia M. Oskinova, Arjan Bik, J.

567,"Surface chemistry on cosmic dust grains plays an important role in the formation of molecules at low temperatures in the interstellar and circumstellar environments. For the first time, we experimentally put in evidence the catalytic role of dust surfaces using the thermal reaction CO2 + 2NH3 = NH4+NH2COO-, which is also a proxy of radical-radical reactions. Nanometre-sized amorphous silicate and carbon grains produced in our laboratory were used as grain analogues. Surface catalysis on grains accelerates the kinetics of the reaction studied at a temperature of 80 K by a factor of up to 3 compared to the reaction occurring in the molecular solid. The evidence of the catalytic effect of grain surfaces opens a door for experiments and calculations on the surface formation of interstellar and circumstellar molecules on dust. Ammonium carbamate on the surface of grains or released intact into protostellar or protoplanetary disk phases can give start to a network of prebiotic reactions. Therefore, there should be a great interest to search for ammonium carbamate and its daughter molecule, carbamic acid, in interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, and protoplanetary disks.","Alexey Potapov, Patrice Theulé, Cornelia Jäger, Thomas Henning",No comment found,1905.13471v1,No journal ref found,Thomas Henning,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13471v1,2019-05-31 09:07:41+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Evidence of surface catalytic effect on cosmic dust grain analogues: the   ammonia and carbon dioxide surface reaction,2019-05-31 09:07:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13471v1
568,"We investigated the long-term behaviour in X-rays of the colliding wind binary WR 25, using archival data obtained with Suzaku, Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR spanning over ~16 years. Our analysis reveals phase-locked variations repeating consistently over many consecutive orbits, in agreement with an X-ray emission fully explained by thermal emission from the colliding winds in the 208-d orbit. We report on a significant deviation of the X-ray flux with respect to the 1/D trend (expected for adiabatic shocked winds) close to periastron passage. The absence of a drop in post-shock plasma temperature close to periastron suggests this break in trend cannot be explained in terms of reduced pre-shock velocities in this part of the orbit. Finally, NuSTAR data reveal a lack of hard X-ray emission (above 10.0 keV) above the background level. Upper limits on a putative non-thermal emission strongly suggest that the sensitivity of present hard X-ray observatories is not sufficient to detect non-thermal emission from massive binaries above 10 keV, unless the wind kinetic power is large enough to significantly feed particle acceleration in the wind-wind interaction.","Bharti Arora, J.

569,"A new experimental set-up INterStellar Ice-Dust Experiment (INSIDE), was designed for studying cosmic grain analogues represented by ice-coated carbon- and silicate-based dust grains. In the new instrument, we can simulate physical and chemical conditions prevailing in interstellar and circumstellar environments. The set-up combines ultrahigh vacuum and low temperature conditions with infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Using INSIDE, we plan to investigate physical and chemical processes, such as adsorption, desorption, and formation of molecules, on the surface of dust/ice samples. First experiments on the photodesorption of water ice molecules from the surface of silicate and carbon grains by UV photons revealed a strong influence of the surface properties on the desorption yield, in particular in the monolayer regime. In the second experiment, the thermal desorption of cometary ice analogues composed of six molecular components was studied for the first time. Co-desorption of CO2 and CH3OH with O2 indicates that at high O2 concentrations in cometary or interstellar ices ""heavy"" ice molecules can be partly trapped in O2 and release to the gas phase much earlier than expected.

570,"We discuss a novel mechanism to generate gravitational waves in the early universe. A standard way to produce primordial black holes is to enhance at small-scales the overdensity perturbations generated during inflation. The latter, upon horizon re-entry, collapse into black holes. They must be sizeable enough and are therefore associated to rare peaks. There are however less sizeable and much less rare overdensity peaks which do not end up forming primordial black holes and have a non-spherical shape. Upon collapse, they possess a time-dependent non-vanishing mass quadrupole which gives rise to the generation of gravitational waves. By their nature, such gravitational waves are complementary to those sourced at second-order by the very same scalar perturbations responsible for the formation of the primordial black holes. Their amplitude is measurable in future experiments.","V. De Luca, V. Desjacques, G. Franciolini, A. Riotto","10 pages, 5 figures",1905.13459v1,No journal ref found,A.

571,"We introduce a new technique to estimate the comet nuclear size frequency distribution (SFD) that combines a cometary activity model with a survey simulation and apply it to 150 long period comets (LPC) detected by the Pan-STARRS1 near-Earth object survey. The debiased LPC size-frequency distribution is in agreement with previous estimates for large comets with nuclear diameter $>\sim 1$~km but we measure a significant drop in the SFD slope for small objects with diameters $<1$~km and approaching only $100$~m diameter. Large objects have a slope $\alpha_{big} = 0.72 \pm 0.09 (stat.) \pm 0.15 (sys.)$ while small objects behave as $\alpha_{small} = 0.07 \pm 0.03 (stat.) \pm 0.09 (sys.)$ where the SFD is $\propto 10^{\alpha H_N}$ and $H_N$ represents the cometary nuclear absolute magnitude. The total number of LPCs that are $>1$~km diameter and have perihelia $q<10$~au is $0.46 \pm 0.15 \times 10^9$ while there are only $2.4 \pm 0.5 (stat.) \pm 2 (sys.) \times 10^9$ objects with diameters $>100$~m due to the shallow slope of the SFD for diameters $<1$~m. We estimate that the total number of `potentially active' objects with diameters $\ge 1$~km in the Oort cloud, objects that would be defined as LPCs if their perihelia evolved to $<10$~au, is $(1.5\pm1)\times10^{12}$ with a combined mass of $1.3\pm0.9 \, M_{Earth}$. The debiased LPC orbit distribution is broadly in agreement with expectations from contemporary dynamical models but there are discrepancies that could point towards a future ability to disentangle the relative importance of stellar perturbations and galactic tides in producing the LPC population.","Benjamin Boe, Robert Jedicke, Karen J.

572,"(modified from published version) Twelve years ago the Catalina Sky Survey discovered Earth's first known natural geocentric object other than the Moon, a few-meter diameter asteroid designated 2006 RH120. Despite significant improvements in ground-based telescope and detector technology in the past decade the asteroid surveys have not discovered another temporarily-captured orbiter (TCO; colloquially known as minimoons). Within a few years the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will either begin to regularly detect TCOs or force a re-analysis of the creation and dynamical evolution of small asteroids in the inner solar system.   The first studies of the provenance, properties, and dynamics of Earth's minimoons suggested that there should be a steady state population with about one 1- to 2-meter diameter captured objects at any time. That model was then improved and extended to include the population of temporarily-captured flybys (TCFs), objects that fail to make an entire revolution around Earth while energetically bound to the Earth-Moon system. Several different techniques for discovering TCOs have been considered but their small diameters, proximity, and rapid motion make them challenging targets for existing ground-based optical, meteor, and radar surveys.   We expect that if the TCO population is confirmed, and new objects are frequently discovered, they can provide new opportunities for 1) studying the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, 2) testing models of the production and dynamical evolution of small asteroids from the asteroid belt, 3) rapid and frequent low delta-v missions to multiple minimoons, and 4) evaluating in-situ resource utilization techniques on asteroidal material.   Here we review the past decade of minimoon studies in preparation for capitalizing on the scientific and commercial opportunities of TCOs in the first decade of LSST operations.","Robert Jedicke, Bryce T.

We found eight molecular clouds (A-H) along the X-ray shell of the SNR. The typical cloud size and mass are $\sim$10-15 pc and $\sim$2000-5000 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The X-ray shell is slightly deformed and has the brightest peak in the southwestern shell where two molecular clouds A and B are located. The four molecular clouds A, B, F, and G have high intensity ratios of $^{12}$CO($J$ = 3-2) / $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) $> 1.2$, not attributable to any identified internal infrared sources or high-mass stars.

It is physically interesting to study QED phenomena in curved spacetimes, in which both strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields play important roles.

575,"We present the large-scale structure over more than 50 comoving Mpc scale at z $\sim$ 0.9 where the CL1604 supercluster, which is one of the largest structures ever known at high redshifts, is embedded. The wide-field deep imaging survey by the Subaru Strategic Program with Hyper Suprime-Cam reveals that the already-known CL1604 supercluster is a mere part of larger-scale structure extending to both the north and the south. We confirm that there are galaxy clusters at three slightly different redshifts in the northern and southern sides of the supercluster by determining the redshifts of 55 red-sequence galaxies and 82 star-forming galaxies in total by the follow-up spectroscopy with Subaru/FOCAS and Gemini-N/GMOS. This suggests that the structure ever known as the CL1604 supercluster is the tip of the iceberg. We investigate stellar population of the red-sequence galaxies using 4000 A break and Balmer H$\delta$ absorption line. Almost all of the red-sequence galaxies brighter than 21.5 mag in $z$-band show an old stellar population with $\gtrsim2$ Gyr. The comparison of composite spectra of the red-sequence galaxies in the individual clusters show that the galaxies at a similar redshift have similar stellar population age, even if they are located $\sim$50 Mpc apart from each other. However, there could be a large variation in the star formation history. Therefore, it is likely that galaxies associated with the large-scale structure at 50 Mpc scale formed at almost the same time, have assembled into the denser regions, and then have evolved with different star formation history along the hierarchical growth of the cosmic web.","Masao Hayashi, Yusei Koyama, Tadayuki Kodama, Yutaka Komiyama, Yen-Ting Lin, Satoshi Miyazaki, Rhythm Shimakawa, Tomoko L.

577,"There exists a constant value of $H(z)$ at $z=-1$ when in $\omega$CDM universe with $\omega > -1$, which is independent on other cosmological parameters. We first combine this theoretical $H(z)$ value with the latest 43 observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) to perform the model-independent Gaussian Processes (GP) and constrain the Hubble constant. We obtain $H_0$=67.67$\pm3.03\ {\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, which is in agreement with $H_0$ values from Plank Collaboration (2015) ($0.24 \sigma $ tension) but a larger deviation from Riess et al.

578,"Parity (P) violation in gravity would be a sure sign of new physics. We examine the possibility of P violation in the cosmological redshift. If right- and left-circularly polarized photons experience the redshift differently, the radiation from distant sources would tend to be depolarized, since the polarizations states would accumulate different phases during propagation. The resulting birefringence has an unusual signature--depending on z^2--quite unlike what is seen in other theories, including those with violation of local boost invariance. The observed broad-spectrum polarization of $\gamma$-ray bursts constrains the fractional difference between the right- and left-handed redshifts at the 6 x 10^(-37) level.","Brett Altschul, Matthew Mewes",9 pages,1104.5673v3,No journal ref found,Matthew Mewes,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.5673v3,2011-04-29 16:20:59+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,Bounds on Parity Violation In the Cosmological Redshift,2019-05-31 05:26:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5673v3
579,"The amplitude of solar p-mode oscillations is governed by stochastic excitation and mode damping, both of which take place in the surface convection zone. However, the time-dependent, turbulent nature of convection makes it difficult to self-consistently study excitation and damping processes through the use of traditional one-dimensional hydrostatic models. To this end, we carried out \textit{ab initio} three-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere to investigate how p-modes are driven and dissipated in the Sun. The description of surface convection in the simulations is free from the tuneable parameters typically adopted in traditional one-dimensional models. Mode excitation and damping rates are computed based on analytical expressions whose ingredients are evaluated directly from the three-dimensional model. With excitation and damping rates both available, we estimate the theoretical oscillation amplitude and frequency of maximum power, $\nu_{\max}$, for the Sun. We compare our numerical results with helioseismic observations, finding encouraging agreement between the two. The numerical method presented here provides a novel way to investigate the physical processes responsible for mode driving and damping, and should be valid for all solar-type oscillating stars.","Yixiao Zhou, Martin Asplund, Remo Collet","11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.13397v1,No journal ref found,Remo Collet,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13397v1,2019-05-31 03:15:34+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,The amplitude of solar p-mode oscillations from three-dimensional   convection simulations,2019-05-31 03:15:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13397v1

The standard deviation of charge clouds of 5.0 keV X-ray is estimated to be $\sigma_{\rm cloud} = 4.30 \pm 0.07$ $\mu$m. Compared to the detector response simulation, the estimated charge cloud size is well explained by a combination of photoelectron range, thermal diffusion, and Coulomb repulsion.

581,"We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast radio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars ( accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons coherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The radiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb the coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the time scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra of the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally broaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional to their center frequencies $\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies ( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler shifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On the other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center frequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift also makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter. Because the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger than those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating FRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields of the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs, which are over the extent of the receiver frequency range. The spectral features of the recently discovered new repeating FRB 180814.J0422+75 are coincident with our general analyses of the repeating FRB 121102.",Aiichi Iwazaki,"11 pages, no figures",1810.07270v3,No journal ref found,Aiichi Iwazaki,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07270v3,2018-10-15 09:58:20+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|hep-ph,Explanation of Detailed Spectral Properties of FRBs by Axion Star Model,2019-05-31 02:06:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07270v3
582,"Observations and semianalytical galaxy formation and evolution models (SAMs) have suggested the existence of a stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation (MZR), which is shown to be universal for different types of galaxies over a large range of stellar masses ($M_*\sim 10^3$-$10^{11}M_\odot$) and dark matter (DM) halo masses ($M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^9$-$10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$). In this work, we construct a chemical evolution model to investigate the origin of the MZR, including both the effects of gas inflows and outflows in galaxies. We solve the MZR from the chemical evolution model, by assuming that the cold gas mass ($M_{\rm cold}$) and the stellar feedback efficiency ($\beta$) follow some power-law scaling relationships with $M_*$ during the growth of a galaxy, i.e., $M_{\rm cold}\propto M_*^{\alpha_{\rm gs}}$ and $\beta\propto M_*^{\alpha_{\beta{\rm s}}}$. We use the SAM to obtain these power-law scaling relations, which appear to be roughly universal over a large range of stellar masses for both satellites and central galaxies within a large range of halo masses. The range of the MZRs produced by our models is in a narrow space, which provides support to the universality of the MZRs. The formation of the MZR is a result caused jointly by that the cold gas fraction decreases with increasing $M_*$ and by that the stellar feedback efficiency decreases with increasing $M_*$ in the galaxy growth, and the exponent in the MZR is around $-\alpha_{\beta{\rm s}}$ or $1-\alpha_{\rm gs}$. The MZR represents an ''average'' evolutional track for the stellar metallicity of a galaxy. The comparison of our model with some previous models for the origin of MZRs is also discussed.","Moran Xia, Qingjuan Yu","22 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

583,"Black hole mass measurements outside the local universe are critically important to derive the growth of supermassive black holes over cosmic time, and to study the interplay between black hole growth and galaxy evolution. In this paper we present two measurements of supermassive black hole masses from reverberation mapping (RM) of the broad CIV emission line. These measurements are based on multi-year photometry and spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES), which together constitute the OzDES RM Program. The observed reverberation lag between the DES continuum photometry and the OzDES emission-line fluxes is measured to be $358^{+126}_{-123}$ and $343^{+58}_{-84}$ days for two quasars at redshifts of $1.905$ and $2.593$ respectively. The corresponding masses of the two supermassive black holes are $4.4 \times 10^{9}$ and $3.3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, which are among the highest-redshift and highest-mass black holes measured to date with RM studies. We use these new measurements to better determine the CIV radius$-$luminosity relationship for high-luminosity quasars, which is fundamental to many quasar black hole mass estimates and demographic studies.","J.

584,"The solar Ly$\alpha$ line is the strongest line in the ultraviolet waveband, and is greatly enhanced during solar flares. Here we present radiative hydrodynamic simulations of solar flares under different heating models, and calculate the response of this line taking into account non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen and partial frequency redistribution. We find that in non-thermal heating models, the Ly$\alpha$ line can show a red or blue asymmetry corresponding to the chromospheric evaporation or condensation, respectively. The asymmetry may change from red to blue if the electron beam flux is large enough to produce a significant chromospheric condensation region. In the Ly$\alpha$ intensity lightcurve, there appears a dip when the change of asymmetry occurs. In thermal models, the Ly$\alpha$ line intensity peaks quickly and then falls, and the profile has an overall red asymmetry, which is similar to the profiles from heating by a soft electron beam. The Ly$\alpha$ profile shows a single red peak at the end of thermal heating, and the whole line is formed in a very small height range.","Jie Hong, Ying Li, M. D.

585,"We consider the radial evolution of perpendicular ion heating due to the violation of magnetic moment conservation caused by Alfven and kinetic Alfven wave turbulence. This process, referred to as stochastic heating, can be quantified by the ratio between the average velocity fluctuations at the ion gyroradius and the perpendicular ion thermal speed $\epsilon \equiv \delta v / v_{t\perp}$. Using 17 years of Helios observations, we constrain how much energy could be dissipated by this mechanism between 0.29 and 0.98 au. We find that stochastic heating likely operates throughout the entire inner heliosphere, but that its radial dependence is steeper than that of empirically derived dissipation rates, being $r^{-2.5}$ compared with $r^{-2.08}$. This difference is significantly increased in fast solar wind streams to $r^{-3.1}$ compared with $r^{-1.8}$.","Mihailo M. Martinović, Kristopher G.

In addition, these quasars are located at among the highest redshifts (z~1.4-2.8) of quasars with black hole masses measured with reverberation mapping.

587,"Using data from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we present a census of AGN-driven ionized outflows in a sample of 159 AGNs at $1.4 \le z \le 3.8$. The sample spans AGN bolometric luminosities of $10^{44-47} \mathrm{~erg~s}^{-1}$ and includes both quiescent and star-forming galaxies extending across three orders of magnitude in stellar mass. We identify and characterize outflows from the \hbeta, [OIII], \halpha ~and [NII] emission line spectra. We detect outflows in $17\%$ of the AGNs, seven times more often than in a mass-matched sample of inactive galaxies in MOSDEF. The outflows are fast and galaxy-wide, with velocities of $\sim 400-3500 ~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$ and spatial extents of $0.3-11.0$ kpc. The incidence of outflows among AGNs is independent of the stellar mass of the host galaxy, with outflows detected in both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. This suggests that outflows exist across different phases in galaxy evolution. We investigate relations between outflow kinematic, spatial, and energetic properties and both AGN and host galaxy properties. Our results show that AGN-driven outflows are widespread in galaxies along the star-forming main sequence. The mass-loading factors of the outflows are typically $0.1-1$ and increase with AGN luminosity, capable of exceeding unity at $L_\mathrm{AGN} \gtrsim 10^{46.3} \mathrm{~erg~s}^{-1}$. In these more luminous sources the ionized outflow alone is likely sufficient to regulate star formation, and when combined with outflowing neutral and molecular gas may be able to quench star formation in their host galaxies.","Gene C.

588,"The Reduced Relativistic Gas (RRG) is a simplified version of the ideal relativistic gas, which assumes that all particles have the same momentum magnitude. Although this is a very idealized situation, the resulting model preserves the phenomenology of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and, in some situations, can be described as a perfect fluid, without introducing large errors in both cosmological background and first-order perturbations. The perfect fluid description of RRG model was already used to study the warmness of dark matter, massive neutrinos and interaction of baryons and photons before recombination, showing very good agreement with previous works based on the full Einstein-Boltzmann system of equations. In order to understand these results and construct a more general and formal framework for RRG, we develop a theoretical description of first-order cosmological perturbations of RRG, based on a distribution function which encodes the simplifying assumption that all particles have the same momentum magnitude. The full set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations for RRG distribution are derived and quantities beyond the perfect fluid approximation are studied. Using RRG to describe warm dark matter, we show that, for particles with $m \sim \text{keV}$, the perfect fluid approximation is valid on scales $k < 10\, \text{h}/\text{Mpc}$, for most of the universe evolution. We also determine initial conditions for RRG in the early universe and study the evolution of potential in a toy model of universe composed only by RRG.","G. Pordeus-da-Silva, R. C. Batista, L. G.

589,"We study the production of chiral fermions in a background of a strong non-abelian gauge field with a non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin density. We discuss both pair production analogous to the Schwinger effect as well as asymmetric production through the chiral anomaly, sourced by the Chern-Pontryagin density. In abelian gauge theories one may nicely understand these processes by considering that the fermion dispersion relation forms discrete Landau levels. Here we extend this analysis to a non-abelian gauge theory, considering an intrinsically non-abelian isotropic and homogeneous SU(2) gauge field background with a non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin density. We show that the asymmetric fermion production, together with a non-trivial vacuum contribution, correctly reproduces the chiral anomaly. This indicates that the usual vacuum subtraction scheme, imposing normal ordering, fails in this case. As a concrete example of this gauge field background, we consider chromo-natural inflation. Applying our analysis to this particular model, we compute the backreaction of the generated fermions on the gauge field background. This backreaction receives contributions both from the vacuum through a Coleman-Weinberg-type correction and from the fermion excitations through an induced current.","Valerie Domcke, Yohei Ema, Kyohei Mukaida, Ryosuke Sato","27 pages + appendices, 2 figures; v2: published version",1812.08021v2,No journal ref found,Ryosuke Sato,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08021v2,2018-12-19 15:29:55+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|cond-mat.mes-hall|hep-th,Chiral Anomaly and Schwinger Effect in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories,2019-05-30 22:10:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08021v2

Techniques originating from the domains of machine learning, pattern recognition and image processing are used to purify the sample of neutrino candidates and for the analysis of the obtained skymap. In contrast to a dedicated search for a specific neutrino emission model, this approach is sensitive to a wide range of possible morphologies of potential sources of high-energy neutrino emission. The application of these methods to ANTARES data yields a large-scale excess with a post-trial significance of 2.5$\sigma$.

591,"In chameleon-$f(R)$ gravity, the fifth force will lead to `upturns' in galaxy rotation curves near the screening radius. The location of the upturn depends on the cosmic background value of the scalar field $f_{R0}$, as well as the mass, size and environment of the galaxy. We search for this signature of modified gravity in the SPARC sample of measured rotation curves, using an MCMC technique to derive constraints on $f_{R0}$. Assuming NFW dark matter haloes and with $f_{R0}$ freely varying for each galaxy, most galaxies prefer $f(R)$ gravity to $\Lambda$CDM, but there is a large spread of inferred $f_{R0}$ values, inconsistent with a single global value. Requiring instead a consistent $f_{R0}$ value for the whole sample, models with $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| > -6.1$ are excluded. On the other hand, models in the range $-7.5<\log_{10}|f_{R0}|<-6.5$ seem to be favoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, with a significant peak at -7. However, this signal is largely a result of galaxies for which the $f(R)$ signal is degenerate with the core/cusp problem, and when the NFW profile is replaced with a cored halo profile, $\Lambda$CDM gives better fits than any given $f(R)$ model. Thus, we find no convincing evidence of $f(R)$ gravity down to the level of $|f_{R0}| \sim 6 \times 10^{-8}$, with the caveat that if cored halo density profiles cannot ultimately be explained within $\Lambda$CDM, screened modified gravity could possibly provide an alternative solution for the core/cusp problem.","Aneesh P.

592,"The coupling of an axion-like particle driving inflation to the Standard Model particle content through a Chern-Simons term generically sources a dual production of massless helical gauge fields and chiral fermions. We demonstrate that the interplay of these two components results in a highly predictive baryogenesis model, which requires no further ingredients beyond the Standard Model. If the helicity stored in the hyper magnetic field and the effective chemical potential induced by the chiral fermion production are large enough to avoid magnetic diffusion from the thermal plasma but small enough to sufficiently delay the chiral plasma instability, then the non-vanishing helicity survives until the electroweak phase transition and sources a net baryon asymmetry which is in excellent agreement with the observed value. If any of these two conditions is violated, the final baryon asymmetry vanishes. The observed baryon asymmetry can be reproduced if the energy scale of inflation is around $H_\text{inf} \sim 10^{10}$--$10^{12}$ GeV with a moderate dependence on inflation model parameters.","Valerie Domcke, Benedict von Harling, Enrico Morgante, Kyohei Mukaida","18 pages, 6 figures",1905.13318v1,No journal ref found,Kyohei Mukaida,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13318v1,2019-05-30 21:25:13+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Baryogenesis from axion inflation,2019-05-30 21:25:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13318v1
593,"HD 163296 is one of the few protoplanetary discs displaying rings in the dust component. The present work uses ALMA observations of the 0.9 mm continuum emission having significantly better spatial resolution (~8 au) than previously available, providing new insight on the morphology of the dust disc and its double ring structure. The disc is shown to be thin and its position angle and inclination with respect to the sky plane are accurately measured as are the locations and shapes that characterize the observed ring/gap structure. Significant modulation of the intensity of the outer ring emission have been revealed and discussed. In addition, earlier ALMA observations of the emission of three molecular lines, CO(2-1), C18O(2-1), and DCO+(3-2), having a resolution of ~70 au, are used to demonstrate the Keplerian motion of the gas, found consistent with a central mass of 2.3 solar masses. An upper limit of ~9% of the rotation velocity is placed on the in-fall velocity. The beam size is shown to give the dominant contribution to the line widths, accounting for both their absolute values and their dependence on the distance to the central star.","P. N. Diep, D. T.

594,"We examine the dynamical properties of interacting galaxies and the properties of shocked gas produced as a result of the interaction. We observed 22 galaxy mergers using the SparsePak IFU at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). The goal of the observations was to obtain the \ha\ velocity maps over the entire luminous parts of the galaxies including the faint tidal tails and to find extended shocks and outflows. Our sample consists of major and minor galaxy mergers with mass ratios $1<\mu<8$. We fit multiple kinematic components to the \ha\ and \nii\ emission lines, develop an MCMC code to robustly estimate the error of fit parameters, and use the F-test to determine the best number of kinematic components for each fiber. We use \nii/\ha\ and velocity dispersion of components to separate star-forming (HII) regions from shocks. We use the kinematics of the \ha\ emission from HII regions and an automated modeling method to put the first-ever constraints on the encounter parameters of one of the observed systems. Besides, we roughly estimate the fraction of shocked \ha\ emission , $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$, without taking extinction into account and examine the spatial distribution of shocks. We find that close galaxy pairs have, on average, a higher shock fraction than wide pairs, and coalesced mergers have the highest average $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$. In addition, galaxy pairs with more equal mass ratio tend to have a higher $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$. Combining the dynamical models from the literature and this work, we inspect trends between $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$ and dynamical encounter parameters. Our findings are generally consistent with shocks being produced either by the direct collision of the ISM or by the chain of events provoked by the tidal impulse during the first passage.","S.

595,"In the last few years, prominent high-ionization nebular emission lines (i.e., OIII], CIII], CIV, HeII) have been observed in the deep UV spectra of z~5-7 galaxies, indicating that extreme radiation fields characterize reionization-era systems. These lines have been linked to the leakage of Lyman continuum photons both theoretically and observationally. Consequently, high-ionization UV emission lines present our best probe to detect and characterize the most distant galaxies that we will observe in the coming years, and are key to understanding the sources of reionization, yet the physics governing their production is poorly understood. Here we present recent high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope spectra of two nearby extreme UV emission-line galaxies, J104457 and J141851. We report the first observations of intense nebular HeII and double-peaked, resonantly-scattered CIV emission, a combination that suggests these galaxies both produce and transmit a significant number of very high-energy ionizing photons (E>47.89 eV) through relatively low column densities of high-ionization gas. This suggests that, in addition to photons at the H-ionizing edge, the very hard ionizing photons that escape from these galaxies may provide a secondary source of ionization that is currently unconstrained observationally. Simultaneous radiative transfer models of LyA and CIV are needed to understand how ionizing radiation is transmitted through both low- and high-ionization gas. Future rest-frame FUV observations of galaxies within the epoch of reionization using the JWST or ELTs will allow us to constrain the escape of helium-ionizing photons and provide an estimate for their contribution to the reionization budget.","Danielle A.

596,"We present a systematic numerical relativity study of the mass ejection and the associated electromagnetic transients and nucleosynthesis from binary neutron star (NS) mergers. We find that a few $10^{-3}\, M_\odot$ of material are ejected dynamically during the mergers. The amount and the properties of these outflow depend on binary parameters and on the NS equation of state (EOS). A small fraction of these ejecta, typically ${\sim}10^{-6}\, M_\odot$, is accelerated by shocks formed shortly after merger to velocities larger than $0.6\, {\rm c}$ and produces bright radio flares on timescales of weeks, months, or years after merger. Their observation could constrain the strength with which the NSs bounce after merger and, consequently, the EOS of matter at extreme densities. The dynamical ejecta robustly produce second and third $r$-process peak nuclei with relative isotopic abundances close to solar. The production of light $r$-process elements is instead sensitive to the binary mass ratio and the neutrino radiation treatment. Accretion disks of up to ${\sim}0.2\, M_\odot$ are formed after merger, depending on the lifetime of the remnant. In most cases, neutrino- and viscously-driven winds from these disks dominate the overall outflow. Finally, we generate synthetic kilonova light curves and find that kilonovae depend on the merger outcome and could be used to constrain the NS EOS.","David Radice, Albino Perego, Kenta Hotokezaka, Steven A.

597,"Small dwarf companions have been long thought to have minimal influence on their host galaxy's evolution without undergoing direct impacts to the host's disc. However, in light of recent discoveries of coplanar, corotating satellite structures around the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Centaurus A, we use an N-body/test particle simulation to show that low-mass dwarf satellites within such structures are able to exert significant influence on their host's disc, driving spiral waves and inducing stellar scattering. This is accomplished through quasi-periodic alignments of multiple small satellites within the structure that emulate the gravitational influence of a single, larger satellite such as Sagittarius Dwarf or the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find that the coplanar, corotational nature of such structures allows for repeated alignments on short enough timescales to overcome damping within the disc, and in a consistent enough fashion to continually drive spiral waves over the course of 2 Gyr of simulation time. The spirals driven by this phenomenon tend to be flocculent and many-armed due to the irregular intervals over which alignments occur. We additionally find that while the aligned satellites are able to induce noticeable thickening of the disc, their ability to drive surface density profile evolution is secondary to other effects.","Alexander Criswell, Curtis Struck","8 pages, 25 figures; accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.13261v1,No journal ref found,Curtis Struck,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13261v1,2019-05-30 18:54:33+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Effects of coplanar satellite bands on galactic disc evolution,2019-05-30 18:54:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13261v1
598,"Chemical tagging has great promise as a technique to unveil our Galaxy's history. Grouping stars based on their similar chemistry can establish details of the star formation and merger history of the Milky Way. With precise measurements of stellar chemistry, chemical tagging may be able to group together stars born from the same gas cloud, regardless of their current positions and kinematics. Successfully tagging these birth clusters requires high quality chemical space information and a good cluster-finding algorithm. To test the feasibility of chemical tagging on data from current and upcoming spectroscopic surveys, we construct a realistic set of synthetic clusters, creating both observed spectra and derived chemical abundances for each star. We use Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to group stars based on their spectra or abundances; these groups are matched to input clusters and are found to be highly homogeneous and complete. The percentage of clusters with more than 10 members recovered is 40% when tagging on abundances with uncertainties achievable with current techniques. Based on our fiducial model for the Milky Way, we predict recovering over 600 clusters with at least 10 observed members and 70% membership homogeneity in a sample similar to the APOGEE survey. Tagging larger surveys like the GALAH survey and the future Milky Way Mapper in SDSS V could recover tens of thousands of clusters at high homogeneity. Access to so many unique co-eval clusters will transform how we understand the star formation history and chemical evolution of our Galaxy.","Natalie Price-Jones, Jo Bovy","16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1902.08201v2,No journal ref found,Jo Bovy,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08201v2,2019-02-21 19:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Blind chemical tagging with DBSCAN: prospects for spectroscopic surveys,2019-05-30 18:50:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08201v2
599,"One of the most triumphant predictions of the theory if general relativity was the recent LIGO-Virgo detection of gravitational wave (GW) signals produced in binary black hole (BH) mergers. However, it is suggested that exotic compact objects, proposed in quantum gravity models of BHs, may produce similar classical GW waveforms, followed by delayed repeating ""echoes"". In a companion paper [1], we have presented different arguments for a universal Boltzmann reflectivity of quantum BH horizons. Here, we investigate the resulting echoes from this prescription. We derive corresponding quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for quantum BHs analytically, and show how their initial conditions can be related to the QNMs of classical BHs. Ergoregion instability is suppressed by the imperfect reflectivity. We then compare the analytic and numerical predictions for echoes in real time, verifying their consistency. In particular, we find that the amplitudes of the first ~20 echoes decay inversely with time, while the subsequent echoes decay exponentially. Finally, we present predictions for the signal-to-noise ratio of echoes for spinning BHs, which should be imminently detectable for massive remnants, subject to the uncertainty in the nonlinear initial conditions of the BH merger.","Qingwen Wang, Naritaka Oshita, Niayesh Afshordi","9 pages, 8 figures, comments are welcome",1905.00446v2,No journal ref found,Niayesh Afshordi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00446v2,2019-05-01 18:44:14+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Echoes from Quantum Black Holes,2019-05-30 18:29:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00446v2

601,"A combination band due to a mechanism whereby a photon excites two or more vibrational modes ({\it e.g.} a bend and a stretch) of an individual molecule is commonly seen in laboratory and astronomical spectroscopy. Here, we present evidence of a much less commonly seen combination band $-$ one where a photon simultaneously excites two adjacent molecules in an ice. In particular, we present near-infrared spectra of laboratory CO/N$_2$ ice samples where we identify a band at 4467.5 cm$^{-1}$ (2.239 $\mu$m) that results from single photons exciting adjacent pairs of CO and N$_2$ molecules. We also present a near-infrared spectrum of Neptune's largest satellite Triton taken with the Gemini-South 8.1 meter telescope and the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) that shows this 4467.5 cm$^{-1}$ (2.239 $\mu$m) CO-N$_2$ combination band. The existence of the band in a spectrum of Triton indicates that CO and N$_2$ molecules are intimately mixed in the ice rather than existing as separate regions of pure CO and pure N$_2$ deposits. Our finding is important because CO and N$_2$ are the most volatile species on Triton and so dominate seasonal volatile transport across its surface.

602,"We present the first high-resolution map of the cold molecular gas distribution, as traced by CO(2-1) emission with ALMA, in a prominent ram pressure stripped tail. The Norma cluster galaxy ESO 137-001 is undergoing a strong interaction with the surrounding intra-cluster medium and is one of the nearest jellyfish galaxies with a long multi-phase tail. We have mapped the full extent of the tail at 1"" (350 pc) angular resolution and found a rich distribution of mostly compact CO regions extending to nearly 60 kpc in length and 25 kpc in width. In total about 10^9 M_sun of molecular gas was detected. The CO features are found predominantly at the heads of numerous small-scale (~ 1.5 kpc) fireballs (i.e., star-forming clouds with linear streams of young stars extending toward the galaxy) but also of large-scale (~ 8 kpc) super-fireballs, and double-sided fireballs that have additional diffuse ionized gas tails extending in the direction opposite to the stellar tails. The new data help to shed light on the origin of the molecular tail - CO filaments oriented in the direction of the tail with only diffuse associated Halpha emission are likely young molecular features formed in situ, whereas other large CO features tilted with respect to the tail may have originated from the densest gas complexes that were pushed gradually away from the disk.

603,"The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (SN) is a highly anticipated observational target for neutrino telescopes. However, even prior to collapse, massive dying stars shine copiously in 'pre-supernova' (pre-SN) neutrinos, which can potentially act as efficient SN warning alarms and provide novel information about the very last stages of stellar evolution. We explore the sensitivity to pre-SN neutrinos of large scale direct dark matter detection experiments, which, unlike dedicated neutrino telescopes, take full advantage of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. We find that argon-based detectors with target masses of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ tonnes (i.e. comparable in size to the proposed ARGO experiment) can detect $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ pre SN neutrinos coming from a source at a characteristic distance of $\sim$200 pc, such as Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Orionis). For such a source, large scale dark matter experiments could provide a SN warning siren $\sim$10 hours prior to the explosion.

606,"Astrophotonics is the new frontier technology to develop diffraction-limited, miniaturized, and cost-effective instruments for the next generation of large telescopes. For various astronomical studies such as probing the early universe, observing in near infrared (NIR) is crucial. To address this, we are developing moderate resolution (R = 1500) on-chip astrophotonic spectrographs in the NIR bands (J Band: 1.1-1.4 $\mu m$; H band: 1.45-1.7 $\mu m$) using the concept of arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs). We fabricate the AWGs using a silica-on-silicon substrate. The waveguides on these AWGs are 2 $\mu m$ wide and 0.1 $\mu m$ high Si3N4 core buried inside a 15 $\mu m$ thick SiO2 cladding. To make the maximal use of astrophotonic integration such as coupling the AWGs with multiple single-mode fibers coming from photonic lanterns or fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), we require a multi-input AWG design. In a multi-input AWG, the output spectrum due to each individual input channel overlaps to produce a combined spectrum from all inputs. This on-chip combination of light effectively improves the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to spreading the photons to several AWGs with single inputs. In this paper, we present the design and simulation results of an AWG in the H band with 3 input waveguides (channels). The resolving power of individual input channels is 1500, while the overall resolving power with three inputs together is 500, 600, 750 in three different configurations simulated here. The free spectral range of the device is 9.5 nm around a central wavelength of 1600 nm. For the standard multi-input AWG, the relative shift between the output spectra due to adjacent input channels is about 1.6 nm, which roughly equals one spectral channel spacing.

607,"We present a new mixed variable symplectic (MVS) integrator for planetary systems, that fully resolve close encounters. The method is based on a time regularisation that allows keeping the stability properties of the symplectic integrators, while also reducing the effective step size whenever two planets encounter. We use a high order MVS scheme such that it is possible to integrate with large time steps far away from close encounters. We show that this algorithm is able to resolve almost exact collisions (i.e with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) while using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed problem such as the Solar System. We demonstrate the long term behaviour on systems of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering for 50 kyr. We compare our algorithm to hybrid methods such as MERCURY and show that for an equivalent cost we obtain much better energy conservation.","Antoine C.

608,"Analysis of APOGEE DR12 stellar radial-velocities by Troup et al. (2016) affirmed the existence of the well-known Brown-Dwarf Desert (BDD). They detected a dearth of spectroscopic binaries (SB) with periods shorter than $\sim 10$ - $30$ days and secondaries with masses in the range of $\sim0.01$ - $0.1\, M_{\odot}$. We reconsider here their sample of binaries, focusing on 116 systems on the main sequence of the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, with mostly K-dwarf primaries. Using our recently devised algorithm to analyze the mass-ratio distribution of a sample of SBs we confirm the BDD existence and delineate its boundaries. For the K-dwarf APOGEE $1$ - $25$ days binaries, the companion-mass range of the BDD is $\sim0.02$ - $0.2\, M_{\odot}$. The mass ratio distribution of the long-period ($25$ - $500$ days) binaries does not show any dearth at the $q$-range studied. Instead, their distribution displays a linear increase in $\log q$, implying a tendency towards low-$q$ values. The limits of the BDD do not coincide with the frequently used mass limits of the brown-dwarf population, sometimes defined as $0.013$ and $0.08\, M_{\odot}$, based on theoretically derived stellar minimum masses for burning deuterium and hydrogen in their cores. Trying to draw the boundaries of the desert, we suggest either a wedged or trapezoidal shape. We discuss briefly different scenarios that can account for the formation of the BDD, in terms of differentiating between stellar secondaries and planets in particular, and compare this desert to the Neptunian desert that can distinguish between Jovian planets and super Earths of short periods.","Sahar Shahaf, Tsevi Mazeh","Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 8 pages, 5 figures",1905.13239v1,No journal ref found,Tsevi Mazeh,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13239v1,2019-05-30 18:00:23+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.EP,Study of the Mass-Ratio Distribution of Spectroscopic Binaries.

609,"Astrophotonics is the application of photonic technologies to channel, manipulate, and disperse light from one or more telescopes to achieve scientific objectives in astronomy in an efficient and cost-effective way. Utilizing photonic advantage for astronomical spectroscopy is a promising approach to miniaturizing the next generation of spectrometers for large telescopes. It can be primarily attained by leveraging the two-dimensional nature of photonic structures on a chip or a set of fibers, thus reducing the size of spectroscopic instrumentation to a few centimeters and the weight to a few hundred grams. A wide variety of astrophotonic spectrometers is currently being developed, including arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), photonic echelle gratings (PEGs), and Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS). These astrophotonic devices are flexible, cheaper to mass produce, easier to control, and much less susceptible to vibrations and flexure than conventional astronomical spectrographs. The applications of these spectrographs range from astronomy to biomedical analysis. This paper provides a brief review of this new class of astronomical spectrographs.","Pradip Gatkine, Sylvain Veilleux, Mario Dagenais","Review Paper. 18 pages, 6 figures.

Predictions include simultaneous triggering of overpressured dense clouds to form luminous old globular clusters, a protogroup environment to generate high relative velocities of the initially gas-rich galaxies in the early universe, and spatially separated dark halos, possibly detectable via gravitational lensing and containing relic low metallicity stars with enhanced [alpha/Fe] at ultralow surface brightness.",Joseph Silk,"MNRAS letters, 5 pages, accepted",1905.13235v1,No journal ref found,Joseph Silk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13235v1,2019-05-30 18:00:02+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,Ultra-diffuse galaxies without dark matter,2019-05-30 18:00:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13235v1
611,"Using the \textsc{Horizon-AGN} hydrodynamical simulation and self-organising maps (SOMs), we show how to compress the complex data structure of a cosmological simulation into a 2-d grid which is much easier to analyse. We first verify the tight correlation between the observed 0.3$\!-\!5\mu$m broad-band colours of \textsc{Horizon-AGN} galaxies and their high-resolution spectra. The correlation is found to extend to physical properties such as redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). This direct mapping from colour to physical parameter space is shown to work also after including photometric uncertainties that mimic the COSMOS survey. We then label the SOM grid with a simulated calibration sample and estimate redshift and SFR for COSMOS-like galaxies up to $z\sim3$. In comparison to state-of-the-art techniques based on synthetic templates, our method is comparable in performance but less biased at estimating redshifts, and significantly better at predicting SFRs. In particular our ``data-driven'' approach, in contrast to model libraries, intrinsically allows for the complexity of galaxy formation and can handle sample biases. We advocate that obtaining the calibration for this method should be one of the goals of next-generation galaxy surveys.","Iary Davidzon, Clotilde Laigle, Peter L. Capak, Olivier Ilbert, Daniel C.

612,"We present the first detailed study of the spatially-resolved dust continuum emission of simulated galaxies at 1<z<5. We run the radiative transfer code SKIRT on a sample of submillimeter-bright galaxies drawn from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. These simulated galaxies reach Milky Way masses by z=2. Our modelling provides predictions for the full rest-frame far-ultraviolet-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these simulated galaxies, as well as 25-pc-resolution maps of their emission across the wavelength spectrum. The derived morphologies are notably different in different wavebands, with the same galaxy often appearing clumpy and extended in the far-ultraviolet yet an ordered spiral at far-infrared wavelengths. The observed-frame 870-$\mu$m half-light radii of our FIRE-2 galaxies are ~0.5-4kpc, consistent with existing ALMA observations of galaxies with similarly high redshifts and stellar masses. In both simulated and observed galaxies, the dust continuum emission is generally more compact than the cold gas and the dust mass, but more extended than the stellar component. The most extreme cases of compact dust emission seem to be driven by particularly compact recent star-formation, which generates steep dust temperature gradients. Our results confirm that the spatial extent of the dust continuum emission is sensitive to both the dust mass and SFR distributions.","R. K. Cochrane, C. C. Hayward, D. Anglés-Alcázar, J. Lotz, T.

613,"We study the photoevaporation of Jeans-unstable molecular clumps by isotropic FUV (6 eV $< {\rm h}\nu$ < 13.6 eV) radiation, through 3D radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations implementing a non-equilibrium chemical network that includes the formation and dissociation of H$_2$. We run a set of simulations considering different clump masses ($M=10-200$ M$_\odot$) and impinging fluxes ($G_0=2\times 10^3-8\times 10^4$ in Habing units). In the initial phase, the radiation sweeps the clump as an R-type dissociation front, reducing the H$_2$ mass by a factor 40-90%. Then, a weak ($\mathcal{M}\simeq 2$) shock develops and travels towards the centre of the clump, which collapses while loosing mass from its surface. All considered clumps remain gravitationally unstable even if radiation rips off most of the clump mass, showing that external FUV radiation is not able to stop clump collapse. However, the FUV intensity regulates the final H$_2$ mass available for star formation: for example, for $G_0 < 10^4$ more than 10% of the initial clump mass survives. Finally, for massive clumps ($\sim 100$ M$_\odot$) the H$_2$ mass increases by 25-50% during the collapse, mostly because of the rapid density growth that implies a more efficient H$_2$ self-shielding.","D.

614,"We study the kinematics of stars in clusters undergoing gas expulsion in standard Newtonian dynamics and also in Milgromian dynamics (MOND). Gas expulsion can explain the observed line-of-sight (LoS) velocity dispersion profile of NGC 2419 in Newtonian dynamics. For a given star formation efficiency (SFE), the shapes of the velocity dispersion profiles, which are normalised by the velocity dispersion at the projected half-mass radius, are almost indistinguishable for different SFE models in Newtonian dynamics. The velocity dispersion of a star cluster in the outer halo of a galaxy can indeed have a strong radial anisotropy in Newtonian dynamics after gas expulsion. MOND displays several different properties from Newtonian dynamics. In particular, the slope of the central velocity dispersion profile is less steep in MOND for the same SFE. Moreover, for a given SFE, more massive embedded cluster models result in more rapidly declining central velocity dispersion profiles for the final star clusters, while less massive embedded cluster models lead to flatter velocity dispersion profiles for the final products. The onset of the radial-orbit instability in post-gas-expulsion MOND models is discussed. SFEs as low as a few percent, typical of molecular clouds, lead to surviving ultra-diffuse objects. Gas expulsion alone is unlikely the physical mechanism for the observed velocity dispersion profile of NGC 2419 in MOND.","Xufen Wu, Pavel Kroupa","15 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.13231v1,No journal ref found,Pavel Kroupa,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13231v1,2019-05-30 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The kinematics of star clusters undergoing gas expulsion in Newtonian   and Milgromian dynamics,2019-05-30 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13231v1
615,"We present a novel numerical routine (oscode) with a C++ and Python interface for the efficient solution of one-dimensional, second-order, ordinary differential equations with rapidly oscillating solutions. The method is based on a Runge-Kutta-like stepping procedure that makes use of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to skip regions of integration where the characteristic frequency varies slowly. In regions where this is not the case, the method is able to switch to a made-to-measure Runge-Kutta integrator that minimises the total number of function evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with example solutions of the Airy equation and an equation exhibiting a burst of oscillations, discussing the error properties of the method in detail. We then show the method applied to physical systems. First, the one-dimensional, time-independent Schr\""odinger equation is solved as part of a shooting method to search for the energy eigenvalues for a potential with quartic anharmonicity. Then, the method is used to solve the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation describing the evolution of cosmological perturbations, and the primordial power spectrum of the perturbations is computed in different cosmological scenarios. We compare the performance of our solver in calculating a primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations to that of BINGO, an efficient code specifically designed for such applications.","F. J.

616,"We propose a new physics scenario in which the decay of a very heavy dark-matter candidate which does not interact with the neutrino sector could explain the two anomalous events recently reported by ANITA. The model is composed of two components of dark matter, an unstable dark-sector state, and a massive dark gauge boson. We assume that the heavier dark-matter particle of EeV-range mass is distributed over the galactic halo and disintegrates into a pair of lighter -- highly boosted -- dark-matter states in the present universe which reach and penetrate the Earth. The latter scatters {\it in}elastically off a nucleon and produces a heavier dark-sector unstable state which subsequently decays back to the lighter dark matter along with hadrons, which induce Extensive Air Showers, via on-/off-shell dark gauge boson. Depending on the mass hierarchy within the dark sector, either the dark gauge boson or the unstable dark-sector particle can be long-lived, hence transmitted significantly through the Earth. We study the angular distribution of the signal and show that our model favors emergence angles in the range $\sim 25^\circ -35^\circ$ if the associated parameter choices bear the situation where the mean free path of the boosted incident particle is much larger than the Earth diameter while its long-lived decay product has a decay length of dimensions comparable to the Earth radius. Our model, in particular, avoids any constraints from complementary neutrino searches such as IceCube or the Auger observatory.","Lucien Heurtier, Doojin Kim, Jong-Chul Park, Seodong Shin","15 pages, 10 figures",1905.13223v1,No journal ref found,Seodong Shin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13223v1,2019-05-30 17:59:59+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE|hep-ex,Explaining the ANITA Anomaly with Inelastic Boosted Dark Matter,2019-05-30 17:59:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13223v1
617,"Currently, we have only limited means to probe the presence of planets at large orbital separations. Foreman-Mackey et al. searched for long-period transiting planets in the Kepler light curves using an automated pipeline. Here, we apply their pipeline, with minor modifications, to a larger sample and use updated stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The latter boosts the stellar radii for most of the planet candidates found by FM16, invalidating a number of them as false positives. We identify 15 candidates, including two new ones. All have sizes from 0.3 to 1 $R_{\rm J}$, and all but two have periods from 2 to 10 yr. We report two main findings based on this sample. First, the planet occurrence rate for the above size and period ranges is $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.20}$ planets per Sun-like star, with the frequency of cold Jupiters agreeing with that from radial velocity surveys. Planet occurrence rises with decreasing planet size, roughly describable as $dN/d\log R \propto R^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -1.6^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$, i.e., Neptune-sized planets are some four times more common than Jupiter-sized ones. Second, five out of our 15 candidates orbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one with five inner planets. We interpret this high incidence rate to mean: (1) almost all our candidates should be genuine; (2) across a large orbital range (from $\sim 0.05$ to a few astronomical units), mutual inclinations in these systems are at most a few degrees; and (3) large outer planets exist almost exclusively in systems with small inner planets.","Miranda K.

618,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and eruptive flares (EFs) are the most energetic explosions in the solar system. Their underlying origin is the free energy that builds up slowly in the sheared magnetic field of a filament channel. We report the first end-to-end numerical simulation of a CME/EF, from zero-free-energy initial state through filament-channel formation to violent eruption, driven solely by the magnetic-helicity condensation process. Helicity is the topological measure of linkages between magnetic flux systems, and is conserved in the corona, building up inexorably until it is ejected into interplanetary space. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that helicity injected by small-scale vortical motions, such as those observed in the photosphere, undergoes an inverse cascade from small scales to large, `condensing' at magnetic-polarity boundaries. Our new results verify that this process forms a filament channel within a compact bipolar region embedded in a background dipole field, and show for the first time that a fast CME eventually occurs via the magnetic-breakout mechanism. We further show that the trigger for explosive eruption is reconnection onset in the flare current sheet that develops above the polarity inversion line: this reconnection forms flare loops below the sheet and a CME flux rope above, and initiates high-speed outward flow of the CME. Our findings have important implications for magnetic self-organization and explosive behavior in solar and other astrophysical plasmas, and for understanding and predicting explosive solar activity.","Joel T.

619,"In the context of transient constant-roll inflation, we compute the non-perturbative field redefinition that relates a Gaussian curvature mode with the real non-Gaussian perturbation. Our computation shows the emergence of a new critical amplitude $\zeta_*$, corresponding to perturbations that prevent the inflaton from overshooting the local maximum, thus becoming trapped in the false minimum of the potential. For potentials with a mild curvature at the local maximum (and thus small non-Gaussianity), we recover the known perturbative field redefinition. We apply these results to the formation of primordial black holes, and discuss the cases for which $\zeta_*$ is smaller or larger than the critical value for collapse of spherically symmetric overdensities.","Vicente Atal, Jaume Garriga, Airam Marcos-Caballero","14 pages, 7 figures",1905.13202v1,No journal ref found,Airam Marcos-Caballero,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13202v1,2019-05-30 17:43:07+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-th,Primordial black hole formation with non-Gaussian random fields,2019-05-30 17:43:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13202v1

621,"The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) yields an inference on the matter sound horizon, within the Standard Model. Independent, direct measurements of the sound horizon are then a probe of possible deviations from the Standard Model. We aim at measuring the sound horizon $r_s$ from low-redshift indicators, completely independent from CMB inference. We use the measured product $H(z)r_s$ from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), plus Supernovae~\textsc{I}a to constrain $H(z)/H_{0}$ and time-delay lenses analysed by the H0LiCOW collaboration to anchor cosmological distances ($\propto H_{0}^{-1}$). Additionally, we investigate the influence of adding a sample of higher-redshift quasars with standardisable UV-Xray luminosity distances. We adopt polynomial expansions in $H(z)$ or in comoving distances, so that our inference is completely independent of any underlying cosmological model. Our measurements are independent of Cepheids and systematics from peculiar motions, to within percent-level accuracy. The inferred sound horizon $r_s$ varies between $(133 \pm 8)$~Mpc and $(138 \pm 5)$~Mpc across different models. The discrepancy with CMB measurements is robust against model choice. Statistical uncertainties are comparable to systematics. The combination of time-delay lenses, supernovae and BAO yields a cosmology-independent (and Cepheid-calibration-independent) distance ladder, and a CMB-independent measurement of $r_s.$ These cosmographic measurements are then a competitive test of the Standard Model, regardless of hypotheses on the underlying cosmology.","Nikki Arendse, Adriano Agnello, Radosław Wojtak","A&A subm. 28/05/2019, 6 pages, 3 figures",1905.12000v2,No journal ref found,Radosław Wojtak,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12000v2,2019-05-28 18:00:50+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Low-redshift measurement of the sound horizon through gravitational   time-delays,2019-05-30 17:18:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12000v2

623,"We introduce an extension of the ELVIS project to account for the effects of the Milky Way galaxy on its subhalo population. Our simulation suite, Phat ELVIS, consists of twelve high-resolution cosmological dark matter-only (DMO) zoom simulations of Milky Way-size $\Lambda$CDM~ haloes ($M_{\rm v} = 0.7-2 \times 10^{12} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) along with twelve re-runs with embedded galaxy potentials grown to match the observed Milky Way disk and bulge today. The central galaxy potential destroys subhalos on orbits with small pericenters in every halo, regardless of the ratio of galaxy mass to halo mass. This has several important implications. 1) Most of the $\mathtt{Disk}$ runs have no subhaloes larger than $V_{\rm max} = 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ within $20$ kpc and a significant lack of substructure going back $\sim 8$ Gyr, suggesting that local stream-heating signals from dark substructure will be rare. 2) The pericenter distributions of Milky Way satellites derived from $\mathit{Gaia}$ data are remarkably similar to the pericenter distributions of subhaloes in the $\mathtt{Disk}$ runs, while the DMO runs drastically over-predict galaxies with pericenters smaller than 20 kpc. 3) The enhanced destruction produces a tension opposite to that of the classic `missing satellites' problem: in order to account for ultra-faint galaxies known within $30$ kpc of the Galaxy, we must populate haloes with $V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 7$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 3 \times 10^{7} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall), well below the atomic cooling limit of $V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 16$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 5 \times 10^{8} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall). 4) If such tiny haloes do host ultra-faint dwarfs, this implies the existence of $\sim 1000$ satellite galaxies within 300 kpc of the Milky Way.","Tyler Kelley, James S.

624,"Context. Variations in pulsar dispersion measures have been observed since shortly after the discovery of pulsars. As early as 2006, frequency-dependent dispersion measures have been observed and attributed to several possible causes. Cordes et al. (2016) demonstrated that ray-path averaging over different effective light-cone volumes through the turbulent ionized interstellar medium must contribute to this effect.   Aims. We present methods to assess the variations in frequency-dependent dispersion measures due to the turbulent interstellar medium versus compact lensing structures along the path of radio propagation. We describe an application of this method to observations presented in Donner et al. (2019) in the direction of PSR J2219+4754 to determine if the data are consistent with proposed extreme scattering events.   Methods. We examine the observations of Donner et al. (2019) in the context of the recent literature on interstellar medium propagation effects and other observations. See full abstract in text.   Results. We find that the frequency dependence of the dispersion measure timeseries for PSR J2219+4754 is consistent with being due solely to turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium and that there is no evidence for an extreme scattering event or small-scale lensing structure in the interstellar medium.","M.

625,"During its two year prime mission the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform a time-series photometric survey covering over 80% of the sky. This survey comprises observations of 26 24 x 96 degree sectors that are each monitored continuously for approximately 27 days. The main goal of TESS is to find transiting planets around 200,000 pre-selected stars for which fixed aperture photometry is recorded every two minutes. However, TESS is also recording and delivering Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of each detector at a 30 minute cadence. We have created an open-source tool, eleanor, to produce light curves for objects in the TESS FFIs. Here, we describe the methods used in eleanor to produce light curves that are optimized for planet searches. The tool performs background subtraction, aperture and PSF photometry, decorrelation of instrument systematics, and cotrending using principal component analysis. We recover known transiting exoplanets in the FFIs to validate the pipeline and perform a limited search for new planet candidates in Sector 1. Our tests indicate that eleanor produces light curves with significantly less scatter than other tools that have been used in the literature. Cadence-stacked images, and raw and detrended eleanor light curves for each analyzed star will be hosted on MAST, with planet candidates on ExoFOP-TESS as Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs). This work confirms the promise that the TESS FFIs will enable the detection of thousands of new exoplanets and a broad range of time domain astrophysics.","Adina D. Feinstein, Benjamin T.

626,"Witt (1996) has shown that for an elliptical potential, the four images of a quadruply lensed quasar lie on a rectangular hyperbola that passes through the unlensed quasar position and the center of the potential as well. Wynne and Schechter (2018) have shown that, for the singular isothermal elliptical potential (SIEP), the four images also lie on an `amplitude' ellipse centered on the quasar position with axes parallel to the hyperbola's asymptotes. Witt's hyperbola arises from equating the directions of both sides of the lens equation. The amplitude ellipse derives from equating the magnitudes. One can model any four points as an SIEP in three steps. 1. Find the rectangular hyperbola that passes through the points. 2. Find the aligned ellipse that also passes through them. 3. Find the hyperbola with asymptotes parallel to those of the first that passes through the center of the ellipse and the pair of images closest to each other. The second hyperbola and the ellipse give an SIEP that predicts the positions of the two remaining images where the curves intersect. Pinning the model to the closest pair guarantees a four image model. Such models permit rapid discrimination between gravitationally lensed quasars and random quartets of stars.","Paul L.

627,"We present an IRAM 30m line survey of the dense core L483 in the 3 mm band. We detected 71 molecules (140 including different isotopologs), most of which are present in the cold and quiescent ambient cloud. Of particular interest among the detected molecules are the cis isomer of HCOOH, the complex organic molecules HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH, a wide variety of carbon chains, nitrogen oxides like N2O, and saturated molecules like CH3SH. In general, fractional molecular abundances in L483 are systematically lower than in TMC-1 (especially for carbon chains), tend to be higher than in L1544 and B1-b, and are similar to those in L1527. Apart from the overabundance of carbon chains in TMC-1, we find that L483 does not have a marked chemical differentiation with respect to starless/prestellar cores like TMC-1 and L1544, although it does chemically differentiate from Class 0 hot corino sources like IRAS 16293-2422. This fact suggests that the chemical composition of the ambient cloud of some Class 0 sources could be largely inherited from the dark cloud starless/prestellar phase. We also derived isotopic ratios for a variety of molecules, some of which show isotopic anomalies like an extreme depletion in 13C for one of the two isotopologs of c-C3H2, a drastic enrichment in 18O for SO and HNCO (SO being also largely enriched in 17O), and different abundances for the two 13C substituted species of C2H and the two 15N substituted species of N2H+. We report the first detection in space of some minor isotopologs like c-C3D. The exhaustive chemical characterization of L483 presented here, together with similar studies of other prestellar and protostellar sources, should allow us to identify the main factors that regulate the chemical composition of cores along the process of formation of low-mass protostars.","M.

628,"Ever since their detection two decades ago, standing kink oscillations in coronal loops have been extensively studied both observationally and theoretically. Almost all driven coronal loop oscillations (e.g., by flares) are observed to damp through time often with Gaussian or exponential profiles. Intriguingly, however, it has been shown theoretically that the amplitudes of some oscillations could be modified from Gaussian or exponential profiles if cooling is present in the coronal loop systems. Indeed, in some cases the oscillation amplitude can even increase through time. In this article, we analyse a flare-driven coronal loop oscillation observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) in order to investigate whether models of cooling can explain the amplitude profile of the oscillation and whether hints of cooling can be found in the intensity evolution of several SDO/AIA filters. During the oscillation of this loop system, the kink mode amplitude appears to differ from a typical Gaussian or exponential profile with some hints being present that the amplitude increases. The application of cooling coronal loop modelling allowed us to estimate the density ratio between the loop and the background plasma, with a ratio of between 2.05-2.35 being returned. Overall, our results indicate that consideration of the thermal evolution of coronal loop systems can allow us to better describe oscillations in these structures and return more accurate estimates of the physical properties of the loops (e.g., density, scale height, magnetic field strength).","C.

629,"The post-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry can lead to the cosmic domain wall catastrophe. In this Letter we show how to avoid domain walls implementing the Instanton Interference Effect (IIE) with a new interaction which itself breaks PQ symmetry and confines at an energy scale smaller than $\Lambda_{QCD}$. We give a general description of the mechanism and consider its cosmological implications and constraints within a minimal model. Contrary to other mechanisms we do not require an inverse phase transition neither fine-tuned bias terms. Incidentally, the mechanism leads to the introduction of new self-interacting dark matter candidates and the possibility of producing gravitational waves in the frequency range of SKA. Unless a fine-tuned hidden sector is introduced, the mechanism predicts a QCD axion in the mass range $1\text{ meV}-15\text{ meV}$.","Andrea Caputo, Mario Reig","12 pages, 4 figures",1905.13116v1,No journal ref found,Mario Reig,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13116v1,2019-05-30 15:46:31+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Cosmic implications of a low-scale solution to the axion domain wall   problem,2019-05-30 15:46:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13116v1
630,"Measurements of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies are often interpreted as requiring a constant density core at the centre, at odds with the ""cuspy"" inner profiles predicted by $N$-body simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. It has been suggested that this conflict could be resolved by fluctuations in the inner gravitational potential caused by the periodic removal of gas following bursts of star formation. Earlier work has suggested that core formation requires a bursty and extended star formation history (SFH). Here we investigate the structure of CDM haloes of dwarf galaxies ($M_{{\rm DM}} \sim 10^9-5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) formed in the APOSTLE ('A Project of Simulating the Local Environment') and AURIGA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations have comparable or better resolution than others that make cores ($M_{{\rm gas}} \sim 10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, gravitational softening $\sim 150$ pc). Yet, we do not find evidence of core formation at {\it any} mass or any correlation between the inner slope of the DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH. APOSTLE and AURIGA dwarfs display a similar diversity in their cumulative SFHs to available data for Local Group dwarfs. Dwarfs in both simulations are DM-dominated on all resolved scales at all times, likely limiting the ability of gas outflows to alter significantly the central density profiles of their haloes. We conclude that recurrent bursts of star formation are not sufficient to cause the formation of cores, and that other conditions must also be met for baryons to be able to modify the central DM cusp.","Sownak Bose, Carlos S.

631,"Thanks to recent high resolution ALMA observations, there is an accumulating evidence for presence of giant planets with masses from $\sim 0.01$ Jupiter mass to a few Jupiter mass with separations up to $ 100$~AU in the annular structures observed in young protoplanetary discs. We point out that these observations set unique ""live"" constraints on the process of gas accretion onto sub-Jovian planets that were not previously available. Accordingly, we use a population synthesis approach in a new way: we build time-resolved models and compare the properties of the synthetic planets with the ALMA data at the same age. Applying the widely used gas accretion formulae leads to a deficit of sub-Jovian planets and an over-abundance of a few Jupiter mass planets compared to observations. We find that gas accretion rate onto planets needs to be suppressed by about an order of magnitude to match the observed planet mass function. This slower gas giant growth predicts that the planet mass should correlate positively with the age of the protoplanetary disc, albeit with a large scatter. This effect is not clearly present in the ALMA data but may be confirmed in the near future with more observations.","S. Nayakshin, G. Dipierro, J.

632,"We suggest that narrow, long radio filaments near the Galactic Center arise as kinetic jets - streams of high energy particles escaping from ram-pressure confined pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). The reconnection between the PWN and interstellar magnetic field allows pulsar wind particles to escape, creating long narrow features. They are the low frequency analogs of kinetic jets seen around some fast-moving pulsars, such as The Guitar and The Lighthouse PWNe. The radio filaments trace a population of pulsars also responsible for the Fermi GeV excess produced by the Inverse Compton scattering by the pulsar wind particles. The magnetic flux tubes are stretched radially by the large scale Galactic winds. In addition to PWNe accelerated particles can be injected at supernovae remnants. The model predicts variations of the structure of the largest filaments on scales of $\sim$ dozens of years - smaller variations can occur on shorter time scales. We also encourage targeted observations of the brightest sections of the filaments and of the related unresolved point sources in search of the powering PWNe and pulsars.","Maxim V.

The new theory with the new $n-n'$ model can demonstrate the evolution in a much more convincing way than the conventional belief. In particular, many observations in stars show strong support for the new theory and the new $n-n'$ model.

634,"We perform a series of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the effects of non-gravitational dark matter (DM) interactions on the intergalactic medium (IGM). In particular, we use the ETHOS framework (Cyr-Racine et al. 2016; Vogelsberger et al. 2016) to compare statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in cold dark matter (CDM) with an alternative model in which the DM couples strongly with a relativistic species in the early universe. These models are characterised by a cutoff in the linear power spectrum, followed by a series of 'dark acoustic oscillations' (DAOs) on sub-dwarf scales. While the primordial cutoff delays the formation of the first galaxies, structure builds-up more rapidly in the interacting DM model compared to CDM. We show that although DAOs are quickly washed away in the non-linear clustering of DM at $z\lesssim10$, their signature can be imprinted prominently in the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z>5$. On scales larger than the cutoff ($k\sim0.08$ s/km for the specific model considered here), the relative difference to CDM is reminiscent of a warm dark matter (WDM) model with a similar initial cutoff; however, the redshift evolution on smaller scales is distinctly different. The appearance and disappearance of DAOs in the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux spectrum provides a powerful way to distinguish interacting DM models from WDM and, indeed, variations in the thermal history of the IGM that may also induce a small-scale cutoff.","Sownak Bose, Mark Vogelsberger, Jesús Zavala, Christoph Pfrommer, Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine, Sebastian Bohr, Torsten Bringmann","15 pages, 12 figures, 1 table.

635,"The unprecedented quality of the data collected by the AMS-02 experiment onboard the International Space Station allowed us to address subtle questions concerning the origin and propagation of cosmic rays. Here we discuss the implications of these data for the injection spectrum of elements with different masses and for the diffusion coefficient probed by cosmic rays through their journey from the sources to the Earth. We find that the best fit to the spectra of primary and secondary nuclei requires (1) a break in the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient at energies $\sim 300$ GV; (2) an injection spectrum that is the same for all nuclei heavier than helium, and different injections for both protons and helium. Moreover, if to force the injection spectrum of helium to be the same as for heavier nuclei, the fit to oxygen substantially worsens. Accounting for a small, $X_{s}\sim 0.4~\rm g~cm^{-2}$, grammage accumulated inside the sources leads to a somewhat better fit to the B/C ratio but makes the difference between He and other elements even more evident. The statistic and systematic error bars claimed by the AMS collaboration exceed the error that is expected from calculations once the uncertainties in the cross sections of production of secondary nuclei are taken into account. In order to make this point more quantitative, we present a novel parametrization of a large set of cross sections, relevant for cosmic ray physics, and we introduce the uncertainty in the branching ratios in a way that its effect can be easily grasped.","Carmelo Evoli, Roberto Aloisio, Pasquale Blasi","15 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication on PRD",1904.10220v2,No journal ref found,Pasquale Blasi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10220v2,2019-04-23 09:36:56+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Galactic cosmic rays after the AMS-02 observations,2019-05-30 15:11:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10220v2
636,"The kinematics of the Milky Way disc as a function of age are well measured at the solar radius, but have not been studied over a wider range of Galactocentric radii. Here, we measure the kinematics of mono-age, mono-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ populations in the low and high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs between $4 \lesssim R \lesssim 13$ kpc and $|z| \lesssim 2$ kpc using 65,719 stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and $\it{Gaia}$ DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural network model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions, finding that the low and high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs display markedly different age--velocity-dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R = 0.64\pm 0.04$, whereas the low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has large variations in this ratio which positively correlate with the mean orbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc component's flat AVRs and constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ clearly indicates an entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ across the disc indicate that low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$, inner disc ($R \lesssim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}$) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant contribution from another heating mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities, likely because they are part of the warped disc.","J. Ted Mackereth, Jo Bovy, Henry W.

637,"Using globular cluster (GC) kinematics and photometry data, we calibrate the scaling relation between the total galaxy mass (M_TOT including dark matter) and total globular cluster system mass (M_GCS) in a sample of 30 early-type galaxies (ETG), confirming a nearly linear relationship between the two physical parameters. Using samples of 83 and 57 ETGs, we investigate this scaling relation in conjunction with the previously known relations between M_TOT and the ISM X-ray luminosity and temperature, respectively. We confirm that M_GCS can be effectively used as a proxy of M_TOT. We further find that the L_X,GAS - M_TOT relation is far tighter in the subsample of core ETGs, when compared to cusp ETGs. In core ETGs (old, passively evolving stellar systems) M_TOT is significantly larger than the total stellar mass M_STAR and the correlation with the hot gas properties is driven by their dark matter mass M_DM. Cusp ETGs have typically lower LX,GAS than core ETGs. In cusp ETGs, for a given M_DM, higher L_X,GAS is associated with higher M_STAR, suggesting stellar feedback as an important secondary factor for heating the ISM. Using the M_GCS- M_TOT scaling relations we compare 272 ETGs with previous estimates of the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxies. Our model-independent estimate of M_TOT results in a good agreement around halo masses of 10^12 Mo, but suggest higher star formation efficiency than usually assumed both at the low and at the high halo mass ends.","Dong-Woo Kim, Nicholas James, Giuseppina Fabbiano, Duncan Forbes, Adebusola Alabi","28 pages, 13 figures, accepted in MNRAS, added new correlations with

638,"We discuss the properties of stellar mass black hole (BH) mergers induced by tidal encounters with a massive BH at galactic centres or potentially in dense star clusters. The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is known to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not always lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to become hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle. For initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW) merger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in $10\%$ ($1\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the growth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the effective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can flip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with large merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather flat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be $\sim 0.6\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This mechanism is unlikely to be the dominant formation channel of BH mergers. However, the current and near-future GW observatories are expected to detect an enormous number of BH mergers. If mergers are found in the vicinity of massive BHs (e.g. the detection of GW lensing echoes or preceding extreme-mass-ratio bursts), this mechanism would provide a possible explanation for their origin.","Joseph John Fernández, Shiho Kobayashi","8 pages, 7 figures.

639,"Early and late multiwavelength observations play an important role in determining the nature of the progenitor, circumburst medium, physical processes and emitting regions associated to the spectral and temporal features of bursts. GRB 180720B is a long and powerful burst detected by a large number of observatories in multiwavelenths that range from radio bands to GeV gamma-rays. The simultaneous multiwavelength observations were presented over multiple periods of time beginning just after the trigger time and extending for more than 30 days. The temporal and spectral analysis of Fermi LAT observations suggest that it presents similar characteristics to other bursts detected by this instrument. Coupled with X-ray and optical observations, the standard external-shock model in a homogeneous medium is favored by this analysis. The X-ray flare is consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model from the reverse-shock region evolving in a thin shell and long-lived LAT, X-ray and optical data with the standard synchrotron forward-shock model. The best-fit parameters derived with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the outflow is endowed with magnetic fields, the radio observations are in the self-absorption regime and the LAT photons beyond the synchrotron limit have to be explained with a different radiative process. We propose that the most natural process to interpret these photons is through the SSC forward-shock model and then predict the very-high-energy flux to be detected by GeV - TeV observatories.","N.

640,"Imaging of the dust continuum emitted from disks around nearby protostars reveals diverse substructure. In recent years, theoretical efforts have been intensified to investigate how far the intrinsic dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) can lead to such features. Turbulence in the realm of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is one candidate for explaining the generation of zonal flows which can lead to local dust enhancements. Adopting a radially varying cylindrical disk model, and considering combinations of vertical and azimuthal initial net flux, we perform 3D non-ideal MHD simulations aimed at studying self-organization induced by the Hall effect in turbulent PPDs. To this end, new modules have been incorporated into the NIRVANA-III and FARGO3D MHD codes. We moreover include dust grains, treated in the fluid approximation, in order to study their evolution subject to the emerging zonal flows. In the regime of a dominant Hall effect, we robustly obtain large-scale organized concentrations in the vertical magnetic field that remain stable for hundreds of orbits. For disks with vertical initial net flux alone, we confirm the presence of zonal flows and vortices that introduce regions of super-Keplerian gas flow. Including a moderately strong net-azimuthal magnetic flux can significantly alter the dynamics, partially preventing the self-organization of zonal flows. For plasma beta-parameters smaller than 50, large-scale, near-axisymmetric structures develop in the vertical magnetic flux. In all cases, we demonstrate that the emerging features are capable of accumulating dust grains for a range of Stokes numbers.","Leonardo Krapp, Oliver Gressel, Pablo Benítez-Llambay, Turlough P.

641,"We use the Fisher information matrix method to calculate the parameter estimation accuracy of inspiraling supermassive black holes binaries for TianQin, a space-borne laser interferometric detector aimed at detecting gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. The `restricted' post-Newtonian waveform in which third order post-Newtonian (3PN) phase including spin effects (spin-orbit $\beta$ and spin-spin $\sigma$) and first-order eccentricity contribution is employed. Monte Carlo simulations using $10^3$ binaries for mass pairs with component masses in the range of $({10^5},{10^7}){M_ \odot }$ and cosmological redshift $z=0.5$ show that the medians of the root-mean-square error distributions for the chirp mass $M_c$ and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ are in the range of $\sim 0.02\% - 0.7\% $ and $\sim 4\% - 8\% $, respectively. The luminosity distance $D_L$ can be determined to be $\sim 1\% - 3\% $, and the angular resolution of source $\Delta \Omega $ is better than 12 deg$^2$. The corresponding results for $z=1.0$ and $2.0$, which are deteriorated with the decreasing of the signal-to-noise ratio, have also been given. We show that adding spin parameters degrades measurement accuracy of the mass parameters (${M_c}$, $\eta$), and the time and the orbital phase of coalescence ($t_c$, $\phi _c$); the inclusion of the first-order eccentricity correction to the phase worsens the estimation accuracy comparing with the circular cases. We also show the effects of post-Newtonian order on parameter estimation accuracy by comparing the results based on second order and third order post-Newtonian phases. Moreover, we calculate the horizon distance of supermassive black hole binaries for TianQin.","Wen-Fan Feng, Hai-Tian Wang, Xin-Chun Hu, Yi-Ming Hu, Yan Wang","16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

642,"Scientific research is a continuous process, and the speed of future progress can be estimated by the pace of finding explanations for previous research questions. In this observers based view of stellar pulsation and asteroseismology, we start with the earliest observations of variable stars and the techniques used to observe them. The earliest variable stars were large amplitude, radial pulsators but were followed by other classes of pulsating stars. As the field matured, we outline some cornerstones of research into pulsating star research with an emphasis on changes in observational techniques. Improvements from photographs, to photometry, CCDs, and space telescopes allowed researchers to separate out pulsating stars from other stars with light variations, recognize radial and nonradial pulsation courtesy of increased measurement precision, and then use nonradial pulsations to look inside the stars, which cannot be done any other way. We follow several highlighted problems to show that even with excellent space data, there still may not be quick theoretical explanations. As the result of technical changes, the structure of international organizations devoted to pulsating stars has changed, and an increasing number of conferences specialized to space missions or themes are held. Although there are still many unsolved problems, such as mode identification in non-asymptotic pulsating stars, the large amount of data with unprecedented precision provided by space missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler) and upcoming missions allow us to use asteroseismology to its full potential. However, the enormous flow of data will require new techniques to extract the science before the next missions. The future of asteroseismology will be successful if we learn from the past and improve with improved techniques, space missions, and a properly educated new generation.",Margit Paparó,"Review appeared in ""Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Science"" special

The analysis recovers what appears to be the Short class and two long-duration classes that differ from one another via peak flux, with negligible variations in fluence, duration and spectral hardness. Neither class has properties entirely consistent with the Intermediate GRB class. Spectral hardness has been a critical Intermediate class property. Rather than providing spectral hardness, Fermi GBM provides a range of fitting variables for four different spectral models; it is not intuitive how these variables can be used to support or disprove previous GRB classification results.","I.

644,"In this paper we consider a specific type of the bimetric theory of gravitation with the two different metrics introduced in the cosmological frame. Both metrics respect all the symmetries of the standard FLRW solution and contain conformally related spatial parts. One of the metric is assumed to describe the causal structure for the matter. Another metric defines the causal structure for the gravitational interactions. A crucial point is that the spatial part of the metric describing gravity is given by the spatial part of the matter metric confromally rescaled by a time-dependent factor $\alpha$ which, as it turns out, can be linked to the effective gravitational constant and the effective speed of light. In the context of such a bimetric framework we examine the strength of some singular cosmological scenarios in the sense of the criteria introduced by Tipler and Kr\'olak. In particular, we show that for the nonsingular scale factor associated with the matter metric, both the vanishing or blowing up of the factor $\alpha$ for some particular moment of the cosmic expansion may lead to a strong singularity with infinite value of the energy density and infinite value of the pressure.","Konrad Marosek, Adam Balcerzak",5 pages,1804.10835v3,No journal ref found,Adam Balcerzak,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10835v3,2018-04-28 17:59:59+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|hep-th|83F05,Strength of singularities in varying constants theories,2019-05-30 12:08:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10835v3
645,"We report on the first bird's-eye view of the innermost accretion disk around the high-mass protostellar object G353.273+0.641, taken by Atacama Large Millimter/submillimeter Array long-baselines. The disk traced by dust continuum emission has a radius of 250 au, surrounded by the infalling rotating envelope traced by thermal CH$_3$OH lines. This disk radius is consistent with the centrifugal radius estimated from the specific angular momentum in the envelope. The lower-limit envelope mass is $\sim$5-7 M$_{\odot}$ and accretion rate onto the stellar surface is 3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or higher. The expected stellar age is well younger than 10$^{4}$ yr, indicating that the host object is one of the youngest high-mass objects at present. The disk mass is 2-7 M$_{\odot}$, depending on the dust opacity index. The estimated Toomre's $Q$ parameter is typically 1-2 and can reach 0.4 at the minimum. These $Q$ values clearly satisfy the classical criteria for the gravitational instability, and are consistent with the recent numerical studies. Observed asymmetric and clumpy structures could trace a spiral arm and/or disk fragmentation. We found that 70$\%$ of the angular momentum in the accretion flow could be removed via the gravitational torque in the disk. Our study has indicated that the dynamical nature of a self-gravitating disk could dominate the early phase of high-mass star formation. This is remarkably consistent with the early evolutionary scenario of a low-mass protostar.","Kazuhito Motogi, Tomoya Hirota, Masahiro N.

646,"Magnetic field geometry is expected to play a fundamental role in magnetar activity. The discovery of a phase-variable absorption feature in the X-ray spectrum of SGR 0418+5729, interpreted as cyclotron resonant scattering, suggests the presence of very strong non-dipolar components in the magnetic fields of magnetars. We performed a deep XMM-Newton observation of pulsar 1E 2259+586, to search for spectral features due to intense local magnetic fields. In the phase-averaged X-ray spectrum, we found evidence for a broad absorption feature at very low energy (0.7 keV). If the feature is intrinsic to the source, it might be due to resonant scattering/absorption by protons close to star surface. The line energy implies a magnetic field of ~ 10^14 G, roughly similar to the spin-down measure, ~ 6x10^13 G. Examination of the X-ray phase-energy diagram shows evidence for a further absorption feature, the energy of which strongly depends on the rotational phase (E >~ 1 keV ). Unlike similar features detected in other magnetar sources, notably SGR 0418+5729, it is too shallow and limited to a small phase interval to be modeled with a narrow phase-variable cyclotron absorption line. A detailed phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals significant phase-dependent variability in the continuum, especially above 2 keV. We conclude that all the variability with phase in 1E 2259+586 can be attributed to changes in the continuum properties which appear consistent with the predictions of the Resonant Compton Scattering model.","D.

In addition to providing the largest sample of fundamental plane distances ever calculated, as well as a well calibrated group catalogue covering the entire SDSS spectroscopic footprint as far a redshift of 0.5, we present several improvements reaching beyond the traditional definition of the fundamental plane. In one approach, we adjusted the distances by removing systematic biases and selection effects in redshift-magnitude space, thereby greatly improving the quality of measurements. Alternatively, by expanding the traditional fundamental plane by additional terms, we managed to remove systematic biases caused by the selection of our SDSS spectroscopic galaxy sample as well as notably reducing its scatter. We discuss the advantages and caveats of these various methods and calibrations in detail. We found that improving the fundamental plane distance estimates beyond the established methods requires a delicate balancing act between various systematic biases and gains, but managed to reduce the uncertainty of our distance measurements by about a factor of two compared to the traditional fundamental plane.","Christoph Saulder, Ian Steer, Owain Snaith, Changbom Park","submitted to MNRAS 26 pages, 19 figures",1905.12970v1,No journal ref found,Changbom Park,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12970v1,2019-05-30 11:30:24+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Distance measurements to early-type galaxies by improving the   fundamental plane,2019-05-30 11:30:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12970v1

649,"Magnetic imprints, the rapid and irreversible evolution of photospheric magnetic fields as a feedback from flares in the corona, have been confirmed by many previous studies. These studies showed that the horizontal field will permanently increase at the polarity inversion line (PIL) after eruptions, indicating that a more horizontal geometry of photospheric magnetic field is produced. In this study, we analyze 20 X-class flares since the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in 15 active regions (ARs) with heliographic angle no greater than 45 degrees. We observe clear magnetic imprints in 16 flares, whereas 4 flares are exceptional. The imprint regions of the horizontal field are located not only at the PIL but also at sunspot penumbra with strong vertical fields. Making use of the observed mass and speed of the corresponding coronal mass ejections (CMEs) , we find that the CMEs with larger momenta are associated with stronger magnetic imprints. Furthermore, a linear relationship, with a Kendall's Tau-b coefficient 0.54, between the CME momentum and the change of Lorentz force is revealed. Based on that, we quantify the back reaction time to be around 70 s, with a 90% confidence interval from about 50 s to 90 s.","Zekun Lu, Weiguang Cao, Gaoxiang Jin, Yining Zhang, Mingde Ding, Yang Guo","11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication on The

In particular, stars in the older populations encode information on the mechanisms that led to the formation of our Galaxy. In this article, we analyze the kinematics, spatial distribution, and chemistry of a large number of stars in the Solar Neighborhood, where all of the main Galactic components are well-represented. We find that the thick disk comprises two distinct and overlapping stellar populations, with different kinematic properties and chemical compositions. The metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) contains two times less metal content than the canonical thick disk, and exhibits enrichment of light elements typical of the oldest stellar populations of the Galaxy. The rotational velocity of the MWTD around the Galactic center is ~ 150 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a rotational lag of 30 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the canonical thick disk (~ 180 km s$^{-1}$), with a velocity dispersion of 60 km s$^{-1}$. This stellar population likely originated from the merger of a dwarf galaxy during the early phases of our Galaxy's assembly, or it is a precursor disk, formed in the inner Galaxy and brought into the Solar Neighborhood by bar instability or spiral-arm formation mechanisms.","Daniela Carollo, Masashi Chiba, Miho Ishigaki, Ken Freeman, Tim Beers, Y.

651,"Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are excellent targets in gamma-ray searches for dark matter. We consider dark matter searches in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The aim of this work is to reveal a quantitative and precise dependence of the accessible dark matter annihilation cross-sections on the dark matter density profiles of dSphs and on the distance to them. In most data analyses, researchers have assumed point-like signals from dSphs because it is difficult to resolve the expected emission profiles with current gamma-ray observatories. In future however, CTA will be able to resolve the peak emission profiles in dSphs. We take several variations of the dark matter density profile of Draco dSph as examples and analyze the simulated observations of with CTA. We derive the accessible region of the dark matter annihilation cross-section with each dark matter density profile. The accessible region of the annihilation cross-section can differ by a factor of 10 among plausible profiles. We also examine the dependence on the distance to the target dSphs by assuming the same profiles of dSphs at different distances. Closer targets are better due to the higher J-factor, while their spatial extension significantly degrades our reach to the annihilation cross-section compared to the value expected from a simple distance-scaling of the J-factor. Spatial extension of the source affects the probable parameter region in energy-dependent ways. In some gamma-ray energy ranges, this behaviour becomes moderately dependent on the properties of the observation facility.","Nagisa Hiroshima, Masaaki Hayashida, Kazunori Kohri","14 pages, 6 figures.

We present a detailed analysis of GRB 190114C prompt emission, using the two \fermi detectors: GBM and LAT. The \emph{LAT low energy events} (LLE) data is also considered. A joint GBM-LAT analysis reveals a sub-$GeV$ spectral cutoff. A similar high energy cutoff was reported in GRB 160509A and GRB 100724B earlier, and a handful of other sources. The cutoff can be explained by the intrinsic opacity due to pair production within the emitting region. Such morphology in these GRBs suggests that they belong to one specific class having a similar source of the radiation mechanism. GRB 190114C shows a transition from non-thermal to a quasi-thermal-like spectrum along with radiation due to external shock. From spectrum analysis and $Lorentz$ factor evolution from the trigger time to late emission, considering the fact that sub-TeV photons are detected in MAGIC, we are able to draw an emission mechanism picture, where the prompt emission spectrum is more consistent with spectrum via photospheric dissipation with presence of external shock emission simultaneously.","Vikas Chand, Partha Sarathi Pal, Ankush Banerjee, Vidushi Sharma, P.

654,"Various instabilities have been proposed as a promising mechanism to accumulate dust. Moreover, some of them are expected to lead to the multiple-ring structure formation and the planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. In a turbulent gaseous disk, the growth of the instabilities and the dust accumulation are quenched by turbulent diffusion of dust grains. The diffusion process has been often modeled by a diffusion term in the continuity equation for the dust density. The dust diffusion model, however, does not guarantee the angular momentum conservation in a disk. In this study, we first formulate equations that describe the dust diffusion and also conserve the total angular momentum of a disk. Second, we perform the linear perturbation analysis on the secular gravitational instability (GI) using the equations. The results show that the secular GI is a monotonically growing mode, contrary to the result of previous analyses that found it overstable. We find that the overstability is caused by the non-conservation of the angular momentum. Third, we find a new axisymmetric instability due to the combination of the dust-gas friction and the turbulent gas viscosity, which we refer to as two-component viscous gravitational instability (TVGI). The most unstable wavelength of TVGI is comparable to or smaller than the gas scale height. TVGI accumulates dust grains efficiently, which indicates that TVGI is a promising mechanism for the formation of multiple-ring-like structures and planetesimals. Finally, we examine the validity of the ring formation via the secular GI and TVGI in the HL Tau disk and find both instabilities can create multiple rings whose width is about 10 au at orbital radii larger than 50 au.","Ryosuke T.

655,"Little is known about the origin of the high-energy and sustained emission from solar Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares (LDGRFs), identified with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), and now Fermi. Though Fermi/Large Area Space Telescope (LAT) has identified dozens of flares with LDGRF signature, the nature of this phenomenon has been a challenge to explain both due to the extreme energies and long durations. The highest-energy emission has generally been attributed to pion production from the interaction of >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter. The extended duration suggests that particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending high in the corona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from back precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks. It is possible to test these models by making direct comparison between the properties of the accelerated ion population producing the gamma-ray emission derived from the Fermi/LAT observations, and the characteristics of solar energetic particles (SEPs) measured by the Payload for Matter-Antimatter Exploration and Light Nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) spacecraft in the energy range corresponding to the pion-related emission detected with Fermi. For fourteen of these events we compare the two populations -- SEPs in space and the interacting particles at the Sun -- and discuss the implications in terms of potential sources. Our analysis shows that the two proton numbers are poorly correlated, with their ratio spanning more than five orders of magnitude, suggesting that the back precipitation of shock-acceleration particles is unlikely the source of the LDGRF emission.","G.

656,"An additional $U(1)$ gauge interaction is one of promising extensions of the standard model of particle physics. Among others, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry is particularly interesting because it addresses the origin of Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos, which naturally leads to tiny light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism. We show that, based on the minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ model, the symmetry breaking of the extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with its minimal Higgs sector in the early Universe can exhibit the first-order phase transition and hence generate a large enough amplitude of stochastic gravitational wave radiation which is detectable in future experiments.","Taiki Hasegawa, Nobuchika Okada, Osamu Seto","15 pages, 4 figures, references and discussion added, the final

657,"Based on a large sample of massive ($M_{*}\geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) compact galaxies at $1.0 < z < 3.0$ in five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields, we quantify the fractional abundance and comoving number density of massive compact galaxies as a function of redshift. The samples of compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) and compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) are constructed by various selection criteria of compact galaxies in literatures, and the effect of compactness definition on abundance estimate is proved to be remarkable, particularly for the cQGs and cSFGs at high redshifts. Regardless of the compactness criteria adopted, their overall redshift evolutions of fractional abundance and number density are found to be rather similar. Large samples of the cQGs exhibit a sustaining increase in number density from $z \sim 3$ to 2 and a plateau at $1<z<2$. For massive cSFGs, a plateau in the number density at $2<z<3$ can be found, as well as a continuous drop from $z \sim 2$ to 1. The evolutionary trends of the cQG and cSFG abundances support the scenario that the cSFGs at $z \geq 2$ may have been rapidly quenched into quiescent phase via violent dissipational processes such as major merger and disk instabilities. Rarity of the cSFGs at lower redshifts ($z < 1$) can be interpreted by the decrease of gas reservoirs in dark matter halos and the consequent low efficiency of gas-rich dissipation.","Shi-Ying Lu, Yi-Zhou Gu, Guan-Wen Fang, Qi-Rong Yuan","15 pages, 8 figures accepted by the Research in Astro.

Even though the cosmogenic activity is declining with time, there are still significant background rates from the remnant nuclides. In this paper, we report measurements of cosmogenic isotope contaminations with less than one year half-lives that are based on extrapolations of the time dependent activities of their characteristic energy peaks to activity rates at the time the crystals were deployed underground. For longer-lived $^{109}$Cd ($T_{1/2}=1.6$ y) and $^{22}$Na ($T_{1/2}=2.6$ y), we investigate time correlations of characteristic $\gamma$/X-ray peaks. The inferred sea-level production rates are compared with caluclations based on the ACTIVIA and MENDL-2 model calculations and experimental data.

659,"Super-Chandrasekhar remnants of double white dwarf mergers could sometimes collapse into a rapidly rotating neutron star (NS), accompanying with a mass ejection of a few times $0.01M_{\odot}$. Bright optical transient emission can be produced by the ejecta due to heating by radioactivities and particularly by energy injection from the NS. Since the merger remnants before collapse resemble a star evolving from the asymptotic giant branch phase to the planetary nebula phase, an intense dusty wind is considered to be driven about several thousand years ago before the collapse and surround the remnant at large radii. Therefore, the optical transient emission can be somewhat absorbed and scattered by the dusty wind, which can suppress the peak emission and cause a scattering plateau in optical light curves. Several years later, as the ejecta finally catches up with the wind material, the shock interaction between them can further give rise to a detectable radio transient emission on a timescale of tens of days. Discovery of and observations to such dust-affected optical transients and shock-driven radio transients can help to explore the nature of super-Chandrasekhar merger remnants and as well as the density and type ratios of double white dwarf systems, which is beneficial in assessing their gravitational wave contributions.","Yun-Wei Yu, Aming Chen, Bo Wang","7 pages, 6 figures",1812.06631v3,No journal ref found,Bo Wang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06631v3,2018-12-17 07:19:27+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Optical and radio transients after the collapse of super-Chandrasekhar   white dwarf merger remnants,2019-05-30 05:49:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06631v3
660,"The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf in a binary with a nondegenerate companion can sometimes lead to the formation of a rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS). The spin-down of this NS can drive a powerful pulsar wind (PW) and bring out some detectable multi-wavelength emissions. On the one hand, the PW can evaporate the companion in a few days to form a torus surrounding the NS. Then, due to the blockage of the PW by the torus, a reverse shock can be formed in the wind to generate intense hard X-rays. This emission component disappears in a few weeks' time, after the torus is broken down at its inner boundary and scoured into a very thin disk. On the other hand, the interaction between the PW with an AIC ejecta can lead to a termination shock of the wind, which can produce a long-lasting soft X-ray emission component. In any case, the high-energy emissions from deep inside the system can be detected only after the AIC ejecta becomes transparent for X-rays. Meanwhile, by absorbing the X-rays, the AIC ejecta can be heated effectively and generate a fast-evolving and luminous ultraviolet (UV)/optical transient. Therefore, the predicted hard and soft X-ray emissions, associated by an UV/optical transient, provide a clear observational signature for identifying AIC events in current and future observations (e.g., AT 2018cow).","Yun-Wei Yu, Aming Chen, Xiang-Dong Li","7 pages, 6 figures",1904.11840v2,No journal ref found,Xiang-Dong Li,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11840v2,2019-04-26 13:36:26+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,X-ray transients from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs,2019-05-30 05:43:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11840v2
661,"A thin viscous accretion disc around a Kerr black hole, which is warped due to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, was shown to cause the spin axis of the black hole to precess and align with the outer disc. We calculate the total LT torque acting on the black hole, and compute the alignment and precession time-scales for both persistent and transient accretors. In our analysis, we consider the contribution of the inner disc, as it can stay misaligned with the black hole spin for a reasonable range of parameter values. We find that the alignment time-scale increases with a decrease in the Kerr parameter below a critical Kerr parameter value, contrary to earlier predictions. Besides, the time-scales are generally longer for transience than the time-scales calculated for persistent accretion. From our analysis of the transient case, we find that the black hole in the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1543-47 could be misaligned, whereas that in the LMXB XTE J1550-564 has aligned itself with the outer disc. The age of the LMXB H 1743-322 is estimated assuming a misaligned disc. We also find that the black hole in a typical Galactic LMXB can take a significantly longer time to align than what was estimated in the past. This may have an important implication on the measurement of black hole spin using the continuum X-ray spectral fitting method.","Srimanta Banerjee, Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya","19 pages, 28 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.12858v1,No journal ref found,Sudip Bhattacharyya,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12858v1,2019-05-30 05:32:01+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|gr-qc,Alignment and precession of a black hole misaligned with its accretion   disc: Application to Low Mass X-ray Binaries,2019-05-30 05:32:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12858v1
662,"We present the X-ray survey results of high-magnetic-field radio pulsars (high-B PSRs) with Swift/XRT. X-ray observations of the rotation-powered pulsars with the dipole magnetic field ${\it B_{\rm d}}$ near the quantum critical field ${\it B_{\rm q}}=4.4\times10^{13}$ G is of great importance for understanding the transition between the rotation-powered pulsars and the magnetars, because there are a few objects that have magnetar-like properties. Out of the 27 high-B PSRs that are in the ATNF pulsar catalogue but have not been reported or have no effective upper-limits in the X-ray bands, we analyze the Swift/XRT data for 21 objects, where 6 objects are newly observed and 15 objects are taken from the archival data. As a result, we have new $3\sigma$ upper-limits for all the 21 objects. Since the upper-limits are tight, we conclude that we do not find any magnetar-like high-B PSRs such as PSR J1819$-$1458. The probability of the high X-ray efficiency in the high-B PSRs is obtained to be $11\%-29\%$. Combining the previous observations, we discuss which parameter causes magnetar-like properties. It may be suggested that the magnetar-like properties appear only when ${\it B_{\rm d}}\gtrsim10^{13.5}$ G for the radio pulsar population. This is true even if the radio-quiet high-B RPP are included.","Eri Watanabe, Shinpei Shibata, Takanori Sakamoto, Aya Bamba","19 pages, 7 figures",1905.12847v1,No journal ref found,Aya Bamba,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12847v1,2019-05-30 04:26:49+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,A high-magnetic-field radio pulsar survey with Swift/XRT,2019-05-30 04:26:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12847v1
663,"In Einstein's general relativity, gravity is mediated by a massless spin-2 metric field, and its extension to include a mass for the graviton has profound implication for gravitation and cosmology. In 2002, Finn and Sutton used the gravitational-wave (GW) back-reaction in binary pulsars, and provided the first bound on the mass of graviton. Here we provide an improved analysis using 9 well-timed binary pulsars with a phenomenological treatment. First, individual mass bounds from each pulsar are obtained in the frequentist approach with the help of an ordering principle. The best upper limit on the graviton mass, $m_{g}<3.5\times10^{-20} \, {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ (90% C.L.), comes from the Hulse-Taylor pulsar PSR B1913+16. Then, we combine individual pulsars using the Bayesian theorem, and get $m_{g}<5.2\times10^{-21} \, {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ (90% C.L.) with a uniform prior for $\ln m_g$. This limit improves the Finn-Sutton limit by a factor of more than 10. Though it is not as tight as those from GWs and the Solar System, it provides an independent and complementary bound from a dynamic regime.","Xueli Miao, Lijing Shao, Bo-Qiang Ma","8 pages, 2 figures; accepted by PRD",1905.12836v1,No journal ref found,Bo-Qiang Ma,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12836v1,2019-05-30 02:59:25+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE|gr-qc|hep-ph,Bounding the mass of graviton in a dynamic regime with binary pulsars,2019-05-30 02:59:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12836v1
664,"We have performed a series of Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of the gamma-ray binary LS 2883, which is comprised of a young pulsar (PSR B1259-63) orbiting a massive Be star with a period of 1236.7 days. The system was observed in 5 epochs, spanning a range from 352 to 1175 days after the periastron passage on 2014 May 4. The observations confirmed the recurrent nature of the high-speed ejecta that appear as an extended X-ray structure (clump) moving away from the binary. Compared to the results of the previous monitoring campaign (between the 2010 and 2014 periastron passages), this time we find evidence suggesting that the clump is accelerated to a projected velocity $ v_{\perp}\approx0.15c$ with an acceleration $a_{\perp}=47\pm2$ cm s$^{-2}$ (for uniformly accelerated motion), assuming that it was launched near periastron passage. The observed X-ray properties of the clump are consistent with synchrotron emission from pulsar wind particles accelerated at the interface between the pulsar wind and the clump.

665,"Terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs may soon be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to characterize their atmospheric composition and search for signs of habitability or life. These planets may undergo significant atmospheric and ocean loss due to the superluminous pre-main-sequence phase of their host stars, which may leave behind abiotically-generated oxygen, a false positive for the detection of life. Determining if ocean loss has occurred will help assess potential habitability and whether or not any O2 detected is biogenic. In the solar system, differences in isotopic abundances have been used to infer the history of ocean loss and atmospheric escape (e.g. Venus, Mars). We find that isotopologue measurements using transit transmission spectra of terrestrial planets around late-type M dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1 may be possible with JWST, if the escape mechanisms and resulting isotopic fractionation were similar to Venus. We present analyses of post-ocean-loss O2- and CO2-dominated atmospheres, containing a range of trace gas abundances. Isotopologue bands are likely detectable throughout the near-infrared (1-8 um), especially 3-4 um, although not in CO2-dominated atmospheres. For Venus-like D/H ratios 100 times that of Earth, TRAPPIST-1 b transit signals of up to 79 ppm are possible by observing HDO. Similarly, 18O/16O ratios 100 times that of Earth produce signals at up to 94 ppm. Detection at S/N=5 may be attained on these bands with as few as four to eleven transits, with optimal use of JWST NIRSpec Prism. Consequently, H2O and CO2 isotopologues could be considered as indicators of past ocean loss and atmospheric escape for JWST observations of terrestrial planets around M dwarfs.","Andrew P.

666,"Extra dimensions, which led to the foundation and inception of string theory, provide an elegant approach to force-unification. With bulk curvature as high as the Planck scale, higher curvature terms, namely f(R) gravity seems to be a natural addendum in the bulk action. These can not only pass the classic tests of general relativity but also serve as potential alternatives to dark matter and dark energy. With interesting implications in inflationary cosmology, gravitational waves and particle phenomenology it is worth exploring the impact of extra dimensions and higher curvature in black hole accretion. Various classes of black hole solutions have been derived which bear non-trivial imprints of these ultraviolet corrections to general relativity. This in turn gets engraved in the continuum spectrum emitted by the accretion disk around black holes. Since the near horizon regime of supermassive black holes manifest maximum curvature effects, we compare the theoretical estimates of disk luminosity with quasar optical data to discern the effect of the modified background on the spectrum. In particular, we explore a certain class of black hole solution bearing a striking resemblance with the well-known Reissner Nordstrom de Sitter/anti-de Sitter/flat spacetime which unlike general relativity can also accommodate a negative charge parameter. By computing error estimators like chi-square, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement, etc. we infer that optical observations of quasars favor a negative charge parameter which can be a possible indicator of extra dimensions. The analysis also supports an aymptotically de Sitter spacetime with an estimate of the magnitude of the cosmological constant whose origin is solely attributed to higher curvature terms in higher dimensions.","Indrani Banerjee, Bhaswati Mandal, Soumitra SenGupta","31 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables",1905.12820v1,No journal ref found,Soumitra SenGupta,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12820v1,2019-05-30 01:45:29+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Does black hole continuum spectrum signal higher curvature gravity in   higher dimensions?,2019-05-30 01:45:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12820v1
667,"We construct samples of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with low-frequency radio data from the recent released TGSS AD1 catalog at 150 MHz. With these samples, we compare the properties of jet power for blazars, radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RL-NLS1s), young radio sources (YRSs) and radio galaxies. The jet-disk connection, and the unification of jetted AGNs are explored. On the Eddington ratio --- Eddington-scaled jet power plane, jetted AGNs can be generally divided into two populations. Low power radio galaxies, low excitation FR IIs (LEG/FR IIs), and most YRSs show larger jet power than accretion power, while FSRQs, RL-NLS1s, and high excitation FR IIs (HEG/FR IIs) are on the contrary. LEG/FR IIs share similar jet power properties with HEG/FR IIs, while their accretion properties are different with the latter. These facts suggest an evolutional sequence from HEG/FR IIs, LEG/FR IIs to FR Is, where the accretion and jet activities get dimmed gradually. LEG/FR IIs are the transitional objects that accretion processes have switched off, while jets are still active. After correcting the contribution from radio core of blazars, the unification between blazars and radio galaxies is confirmed with the jet power distributions. The unification involved RL-NLS1s is more complicated than the simple scenarios of black hole growth or orientation effect. In addition, our results manifest that low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs (LBLs) contain two distinct groups on the distribution of jet power, with one group similar with FSRQs and the other similar with intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lacs. The LBLs with higher jet powers might be the aligned counterparts of LEG/FR IIs.","Xu-Liang Fan, Qingwen Wu","16 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted by ApJ",1905.12815v1,No journal ref found,Qingwen Wu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12815v1,2019-05-30 01:30:44+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE,Jet Power of Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei: Implication for Evolution   and Unification,2019-05-30 01:30:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12815v1
668,"By analyzing two sets of complete $BVR_cI_c$ light curves of V342 UMa and three sets of complete $BVR_cI_c$ light curves of V509 Cam, we determined that the two systems are both W-subtype contact binaries and that V342 UMa shows a shallow contact configuration, while V509 Cam exhibits a medium contact configuration. Since both of them are totally eclipsing binaries, the physical parameters derived only by the photometric light curves are reliable.Meanwhile, the period changes of the two targets were analyzed based on all available eclipsing times. We discovered that V342 UMa shows long-term period decrease with a rate of $-1.02(\pm0.54)\times10^{-7}$ days/year and that V509 Cam exhibits long-term period increase with a rate of $3.96(\pm0.90)\times10^{-8}$ days/year. Both the conservative mass transfer and AML via magnetic stellar winds can interpret the long-term period decrease of V342 UMa. The long-term period increase of V509 Cam can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive star to the more massive one. The absolute parameters of the two binaries were estimated according to the Gaia distances and our derived photometric solution results. This method can be extended to other contact binaries without radial velocities but with reliable photometric solutions. The evolutionary states of them were discussed, we found that they reveal identical properties of other W-subtype contact systems.","Kai Li, Qi-Qi Xia, Jin-Zhong Liu, Yu Zhang, Xing Gao, Shao-Ming Hu, Di-Fu Guo, Xu Chen, Yuan Liu","14 pages, 9 figures, and 5 tables, accepted by RAA",1905.01646v2,No journal ref found,Yuan Liu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01646v2,2019-05-05 10:14:51+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Photometric investigations on two totally eclipsing contact binaries:   V342 UMa and V509 Cam,2019-05-30 00:44:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01646v2
669,"Here we analyze the first simultaneous X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and centimeter observations of a T Tauri star (TTS). We present three epochs of simultaneous Spitzer and VLA data of GM Aur separated by ~1 wk. These data are compared to previously published HST and Chandra observations from which mass accretion rates ($\dot M$) and X-ray luminosities, respectively, were measured. The mid-infrared emission increases along with $\dot M$, and we conclude that this is due to an increase in the mass in the inner disk. The cm emission, which probes the jet, also appears to increase as $\dot M$ increases, and the changes in the cm flux are consistent with the variability in $\dot M$ assuming the mass-loss rate is ~10% $\dot M$. The 3 cm emission morphology also appears changed compared with observations taken three years previously, suggesting that for the first time, we may be tracking changes in the jet morphology of a TTS. The X-ray luminosity is constant throughout the three epochs, ruling out variable high-energy stellar radiation as the cause for the increases in the mid-infrared or cm emission. Tying together the multiwavelength variability observed, we conclude that an increase in the surface density in the inner disk resulted in more mass loading onto the star and therefore a higher $\dot M$, which led to a higher mass-loss rate in the jet.

670,"We present the results of mapping observations toward a nearby starless filamentary cloud, the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1), in the CCS(JN=43-32, 45.379033 GHz) emission line, using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The map shows that the TMC-1 filament has a diameter of ~0.1 pc and a length of ~0.5 pc at a distance of 140 pc. The position-velocity diagrams of CCS clearly indicate the existence of velocity-coherent substructures in the filament. We identify 21 substructures that are coherent in the position-position-velocity space by eye. Most of the substructures are elongated along the major axis of the TMC-1 filament. The line densities of the subfilaments are close to the critical line density for the equilibrium (~17 Mo/pc for the excitation temperature of 10 K), suggesting that self-gravity should play an important role in the dynamics of the subfilaments.","Kazuhito Dobashi, Tomomi Shimoikura, Tetsu Ochiai, Fumitaka Nakamura, Seiji Kameno, Izumi Mizuno, Kotomi Taniguchi",To appear in the Astrophysical Journal,1905.12773v1,No journal ref found,Kotomi Taniguchi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12773v1,2019-05-29 23:10:57+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Discovery of CCS Velocity-Coherent Substructures in the Taurus Molecular   Cloud 1,2019-05-29 23:10:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12773v1

672,"The separation of cosmological signal from astrophysical foregrounds is a fundamental challenge for any effort to probe the evolution of neutral hydrogen during the Cosmic Dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR) using the 21 cm hyperfine transition. Foreground separation is made possible by their intrinsic spectral smoothness, making them distinguishable from spectrally complex cosmological signal even though they are ~5 orders of magnitude brighter. Precisely calibrated radio interferometers are essential to maintaining the smoothness and thus separability of the foregrounds. One powerful calibration strategy is to use redundant measurements between pairs of antennas with the same physical separation in order to solve for each antenna's spectral response without reference to a sky model. This strategy is being employed by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a large radio telescope in South Africa that is now observing while being built out to 350 14-m dishes. However, the deviations from perfect redundancy inherent in any real radio telescope complicate the calibration problem. Using simulations of HERA, we show how calibration with antenna-to-antenna variations in dish construction and placement generally lead to spectral structure in otherwise smooth foregrounds that significantly reduces the number of cosmological modes available to a 21 cm measurement. However, we also show that this effect can be largely eliminated by a modified redundant-baseline calibration strategy that relies predominantly on short baselines.","Naomi Orosz, Joshua S.

673,"Aims: We present and study spatially resolved imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of multiple $^{12}$CO($J=$6$-$5, 8$-$7 and 9$-$8) and two H$_2$O(2$_{02}-$1$_{11}$ and 2$_{11}-$2$_{02}$) emission lines and cold dust continuum toward the gravitationally lensed dusty star forming galaxy SPT0346-52 at z=$5.656$. Methods: Using a visibility-domain source-plane reconstruction we probe the structure and dynamics of the different components of the interstellar medium (ISM) in this galaxy down to scales of 1 kpc in the source plane. Results: Measurements of the intrinsic sizes of the different CO emission lines indicate that the higher J transitions trace more compact regions in the galaxy. Similarly, we find smaller dust continuum intrinsic sizes with decreasing wavelength, based on observations at rest-frame 130, 300 and 450$\mu$m. The source shows significant velocity structure, and clear asymmetry where an elongated structure is observed in the source plane with significant variations in their reconstructed sizes. This could be attributed to a compact merger or turbulent disk rotation. The differences in velocity structure through the different line tracers, however, hint at the former scenario in agreement with previous [CII] line imaging results. Measurements of the CO line ratios and magnifications yield significant variations as a function of velocity, suggesting that modeling of the ISM using integrated values could be misinterpreted. Modeling of the ISM in SPT0346-52 based on delensed fluxes indicate a highly dense and warm medium, qualitatively similar to that observed in high redshift quasar hosts.","Yordanka Apostolovski, Manuel Aravena, Timo Anguita, Justin Spilker, Axel Weiss, Matthieu Bethermin, Scott C.

674,"The galaxy catalogs generated from low-resolution emission line surveys often contain both foreground and background interlopers due to line misidentification, which can bias the cosmological parameter estimation. In this paper, we present a method for correcting the interloper bias by using the joint-analysis of auto- and cross-power spectra of the main and the interloper samples. In particular, we can measure the interloper fractions from the cross-correlation between the interlopers and survey galaxies, because the true cross-correlation must be negligibly small. The estimated interloper fractions, in turn, remove the interloper bias in the cosmological parameter estimation. For example, in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) low-redshift ($z<0.5$) [O II] $\lambda3727${\AA} emitters contaminate high-redshift ($1.9<z<3.5$) Lyman-$\alpha$ line emitters. We demonstrate that the joint-analysis method yields a high signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the interloper fractions while only marginally increasing the uncertainties in the cosmological parameters relative to the case without interlopers. We also show the same is true for the high-latitude spectroscopic survey of Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission where contamination occurs between the Balmer-$\alpha$ line emitters at lower redshifts ($1.1<z<1.9$) and Oxygen ([O III] $\lambda5007${\AA}) line emitters at higher redshifts ($1.7<z<2.8$).","Henry S.

675,"Motivated by the discovery of large-scale ionized clouds around AGN host galaxies, and particularly the large fraction of those which are consistent with photoionized gaseous tidal debris, we have searched for [O III] emission over wide fields around a set of Seyfert galaxies previously mapped in H I, many of which show extended gas features. The detection threshold was designed to reach mean emission-line surface brightness 10 times fainter than seen in such AGN-ionized clouds as Hanny's Voorwerp, so that similar structures at larger distances (and ages) could be detected. Of 24 Seyfert galaxies, we find one extended emission feature, a discrete cloud projected 12 kpc from the center of Mkn 1 and spanning a transverse extent of 8 kpc. Optical spectroscopy of the Mkn 1 cloud confirms its redshift association with the Mkn 1- NGC 451 galaxy pair, shows it to closely match the kinematics of nearby H I, and reveals emission-line ratios requiring photoionization by the AGN at roughly the direct observed luminosity of the nucleus. Given the small fraction of H I features with detected [O III] emission, we constrain the typical opening angle of ionization cones in Seyfert galaxies to be of order 20 deg, if active episodes are long compared to the light-travel times involved. An appendix presents a derivation of an analytical expression for the probability of intersection of a cone with randomly oriented arcs, approximating the geometry of H I clouds and tails exposed to ionization cones. For the entire sample, the full opening angle of bicones must be <20 deg if the AGN are continuously bright for scales longer than the light-travel times across the H I structures. Since many ionization cones are observed to be much broader than this, our low detection fraction may add to evidence for the ubiquity of strong variations in AGN luminosity on scales 10,000-100,000 years.","Erin Darnell Knese, William C.

678,"The wide, deep cavities of transition disks are often believed to have been hollowed out by nascent planetary systems. PDS 70, a ${\sim}5$ Myr old transition disk system in which a multi-Jupiter-mass planet candidate at 22 au coexists with a ${\sim}30$ au gas and ${\sim}60$ au dust-continuum gap, provides a valuable case study for this hypothesis. Using the PEnGUIn hydrodynamics code, we simulate the orbital evolution and accretion of PDS 70b in its natal disk over the lifetime of the system. When the accreting planet reaches about 2.5 Jupiter masses, it spontaneously grows in eccentricity and consumes material from a wide swathe of the PDS 70 disk; radiative transfer post-processing with DALI shows that this accurately reproduces the observed gap profile. Our results demonstrate that super-Jupiter planets can single-handedly carve out transition disk cavities, and indicate that the high eccentricities measured for such giants may be a natural consequence of disk-planet interaction.","Dhruv Muley, Jeffrey Fung, Nienke van der Marel",ApJL accepted.

679,"We examine the relationship between individual black hole (BH) masses in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. Analyzing the ten BBH detections from LIGO/Virgo's first two observing runs, we find that the masses of the black holes comprising each binary are unlikely to be randomly drawn from the same underlying distribution. Instead, we find that the two BHs prefer to be of comparable mass. We show that it is $\sim 7$ times more likely that the component BHs in a given binary are always equal (to within 5\%) than that they are randomly paired. If we insist that component BHs are randomly drawn from the same underlying power-law distribution with slope $\gamma$, we find $\gamma = -0.8^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ (median and 90\% credible interval). However, it is more likely that the probability of a merger between two BHs depends on their mass ratio, $q \leq 1$. If we assume a scaling of $q^\beta$, so that $\beta=0$ corresponds to random pairings, we find $\beta>0$ is favored at credibility $0.994$. If we additionally introduce a minimum mass ratio threshold, $q_\mathrm{min} < q < 1$, we find $\beta = 5.0^{+6.2}_{-7.5}$, $q_\mathrm{min} = 0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$, and $\gamma = -1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. This implies that only 1\% of merging binaries have mass ratios less than $q_{1\%} = 0.66^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$, compared to $q_{1\%} = 0.17^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ if the pairing is done at random. We conclude that merging black holes do not form random pairings; instead they are selective about their partners, preferring to mate with black holes of a similar mass. The details of these selective pairings provide insight into the underlying formation channels of merging binary black holes.","Maya Fishbach, Daniel E.

680,"We study the first cosmological implications of the mimetic theory of massive gravity recently proposed by Chamseddine and Mukhanov. This is a novel theory of ghost-free massive gravity which additionally contains a mimetic dark matter component. In an echo of other modified gravity theories, there are self-accelerating solutions which contain a ghost instability. In the ghost-free region of parameter space, the effect of the graviton mass on the cosmic expansion history amounts to an effective negative cosmological constant, a radiation component, and a negative curvature term. This allows us to place constraints on the model parameters---the graviton mass and the St\""uckelberg vacuum expectation value---by insisting that the effective radiation and curvature terms be within observational bounds. The late-time acceleration must be accounted for by a separate positive cosmological constant or other dark energy sector. We impose further constraints at the level of perturbations by demanding linear stability. We comment on the possibility of distinguishing this theory from $\Lambda$CDM with current and future large-scale structure surveys.","Adam R.

681,"The reflected light signal from a planet throughout its orbit is a powerful probe of a planet's atmospheric properties. There are a number of planets that are amenable to reflected light phase curve studies with present and future space-based instrumentation and here we assess our ability to characterize these worlds. Using simulated TESS populations we identify the Nine, a set of archetypal exoplanets with the potential to be bright in reflected light, because of their radii and proximity to their star, while still being cool enough to have minimal thermal contamination at optical wavelengths. For each planet we compute albedo spectra for several cloud and atmosphere assumptions (e.g. thermochemical equilibrium, solar composition). We find that in the TESS bandpass the estimated contrast at optical wavelengths is typically <10 ppm except for the brightest, largest, or closest in planets with the highest lofted clouds where contrast can reach a few tens of ppm. Meanwhile, in a bluer bandpass (0.3--0.5 microns) the estimated contrast can be as high as 150 ppm but typically 10-50 ppm. In the temperature range of interest, planets with the highest, most extensive cloud decks are generally darker at bluer wavelengths than cloudless planets because of the low single scattering albedos of their primary condensate constituents. Our models suggest that Neptune-sized planets with relatively low insolation and small semi-major axes are the most conducive to reflected light phase curve studies in TESS.","L. C. Mayorga, N. E.

682,"In this work, we present a spectral and temporal analysis of {\it Swift}/XRT and {\it NuSTAR} observations of GRS 1716--249 during its recent 2016--2017 outburst. This low mass X-ray binary underwent an extraordinary outburst after a long quiescence of 23 years, since its last major outburst in 1993. The source was observed over two different epochs during 2017 April, 07 and 10. The best fit joint spectral fitting in the energy range 0.5 $-$ 79.0 keV indicates that the spectrum is best described by relatively cold, weak disk blackbody emission, dominant thermal Comptonization emission, and a relativistically broadened fluorescent iron K$\alpha$ emission line. We observed a clear indication of a Compton hump around 30 keV. We also detected an excess feature of $\sim1.3$ keV. Assuming a lamp-post geometry of the corona, we constrained the inner disk radius for both observations to 11.92$^{+8.62}_{-11.92}$ R$_{ISCO}$ (i.e., an upper limit) and 10.39$^{+9.51}_{-3.02}$ R$_{ISCO}$ (where R$_{ISCO}\equiv$ radius of the innermost stable circular orbit) for the first epoch (E1) and second epoch (E2), respectively. A significant ($\sim5\sigma$) type$-$C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $1.20\pm0.04$ Hz is detected for the first time for GRS 1716--249, which drifts to $1.55\pm0.04$ Hz ($\sim6\sigma$) at the end of the second observation.

684,"Recent studies on hypervelocity stars (HVSs) have generated a need to understand the high velocity limits of binary systems. If runaway binary systems with high movement speeds well in excess of 200km/s were to exist, it would have implications on how HVS candidates are selected, and our current understanding of how they form needs to be reinforced. In this paper, we explore the possibility that such high velocity runaway binaries (HVRBs) can be engendered by supernova explosions of the tertiary in close hierarchical triple systems. We find that such explosions can lead to significant remnant binary velocities, and demonstrate via constraining the velocity distribution of such HVRBs that this mechanism can lead to binaries with centre of mass velocities of 350 km/s or more, relative to the original centre of mass of the progenitor triple system. This translates into potential observations of binaries with velocities high enough to escape the Galaxy, once the Galactic rotational velocity and objects of Large Magellanic Cloud origins are considered.","Yan Gao, Jiao Li, Shi Jia","5 pages, 2 figures",1905.12653v1,No journal ref found,Shi Jia,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12653v1,2019-05-29 18:04:37+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,High Velocity Runaway Binaries from Supernovae in Triple Systems,2019-05-29 18:04:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12653v1
685,"Future CMB experiments will require exquisite control of systematics in order to constrain the $B$-mode polarisation power spectrum. One class of systematics that requires careful study is instrumental systematics. The potential impact of such systematics is most readily understood by considering analysis pipelines based on pair differencing. In this case, any differential gain, pointing or beam ellipticity between the two detectors in a pair can result in intensity leakage into the $B$-mode spectrum, which needs to be controlled to a high precision due to the much greater magnitude of the total intensity signal as compared to the $B$-mode signal. One well known way to suppress such systematics is through careful design of the scan-strategy, in particular making use of any capability to rotate the instrument about its pointing (boresight) direction. Here, we show that the combination of specific choices of such partial boresight rotation angles with redundancies present in the scan strategy is a powerful approach for suppressing systematic effects. This mitigation can be performed in analysis in advance of map-making and, in contrast to other approaches (e.g. deprojection or filtering), results in no signal loss. We demonstrate our approach explicitly with time ordered data simulations relevant to next-generation ground-based CMB experiments, using deep and wide scan strategies appropriate for experiments based in Chile. These simulations show a reduction of multiple orders of magnitude in the spurious $B$-mode signal arising from differential gain and differential pointing systematics.","Daniel B.

686,We present bounds on mirror dark matter scenario derived by using the effect of mirror matter on the luminosity of the Sun. In the perturbative regime where the mirror matter concentration is small relative to the ordinary matter we estimate the heat transfer from ordinary matter to the mirror sector by simple analytic consideration. That amount of heat transfer is radiated via mirror photons and increases the required energy production in order to maintain the observed luminosity. We then present more detailed numerical calculations of the total amount of this energy transfer.,"Erez Michaely, Itzhak Goldman, Shmuel Nussinov",Comments are welcomed,1905.12643v1,No journal ref found,Shmuel Nussinov,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12643v1,2019-05-29 18:00:12+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR|hep-ph,Solar luminosity bounds on mirror matter,2019-05-29 18:00:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12643v1
687,"The observed characteristics of globular cluster (GC) systems, such as metallicity distributions, are commonly used to place constraints on galaxy formation models. However, obtaining reliable metallicity values is particularly difficult because of our limited means to obtain high quality spectroscopy of extragalactic GCs. Often, `color--metallicity relations' are invoked to convert easier-to-obtain photometric measurements into metallicities, but there is no consensus on what form these relations should take. In this paper we make use of multiple photometric datasets and iron metallicity values derived from applying full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models to deep Keck/LRIS spectra of 177 GCs centrally located around M87 to obtain a new color--metallicity relation. Our new relation differs substantially from previous relations in the blue, and we present evidence that the M87 relation differs from that of the Milky Way GCs, suggesting environmental dependence of GC properties. We use our color--metallicity relation to derive a new GC metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relation for red and blue GCs and find a shallower relation for the blue GCs than what previous work has found and that the metal-poor GCs are more enriched than what was previously found. This could indicate that the progenitor satellite galaxies that now make up the stellar halos of early-type galaxies are more massive and formed later than previously thought, or that the properties of metal-poor GCs are less dependent on their present-day host, indicating a common origin.","Alexa Villaume, Aaron J.

688,"A long (110 cMpc/$h$) and deep absorption trough in the Ly$\alpha$ forest has been observed extending down to redshift 5.5 in the spectrum of ULAS J0148+0600. Although no Ly$\alpha$ transmission is detected, Ly$\beta$ spikes are present which has led to claims that the gas along this trough must be ionized. Using high resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations in large volumes, we show that in a scenario where reionization ends late ($z \sim 5.2$), our simulations can reproduce troughs as long as observed. In this model, we find that the troughs are caused by islands of neutral hydrogen. Small ionized holes within the neutral islands allow for the transmission of Ly$\beta$. We have also modelled the Ly$\alpha$ emitter population around the simulated troughs, and show that there is a deficit of Ly$\alpha$ emitters close to the trough as is observed.","Laura C.

689,"The composition of gas and solids in protoplanetary discs sets the composition of planets that form out of them. Recent chemical models have shown that the composition of gas and dust in discs evolves on Myr time-scales, with volatile species disappearing from the gas phase. However, discs evolve due to gas accretion and radial drift of dust on time-scales similar to these chemical time-scales. Here we present the first model coupling the chemical evolution in the disc mid-planes with the evolution of discs due to accretion and radial drift of dust. Our models show that transport will always overcome the depletion of CO$_2$ from the gas phase, and can also overcome the depletion of CO and CH$_4$ unless both transport is slow (viscous $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the ionization rate is high ($\zeta \approx 10^{-17}$). Including radial drift further enhances the abundances of volatile species because they are carried in on the surface of grains before evaporating left at their ice lines. Due to large differences in the abundances within 10 au for models with and without efficient radial drift, we argue that composition can be used to constrain models of planet formation via pebble accretion.","Richard A.

690,"The majority of the discovered transiting circumbinary planets are located very near the innermost stable orbits permitted, raising questions about the origins of planets in such perturbed environments. Most favored formation scenarios invoke formation at larger distances and subsequent migration to their current locations. Disk-driven planet migration in multi-planet systems is likely to trap planets in mean motion resonances and drive planets inward into regions of larger dynamical perturbations from the binary. We demonstrate how planet-planet resonances can interact with the binary through secular forcing and mean-motion resonances, driving chaos in the system. We show how this chaos will shape the architecture of circumbinary systems, with specific applications to Kepler 47 and the Pluto-Charon system, limiting maximum possible stable eccentricities and indicating what resonances are likely to exist. We are also able to constrain the minimum migration rates of resonant circumbinary planets.","Adam P. Sutherland, Kaitlin M.

691,"The type-I seesaw represents one of the most popular extensions of the Standard Model. Previous studies of this model have mostly focused on its ability to explain neutrino oscillations as well as on the generation of the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Recently, it has been pointed out that the type-I seesaw can also account for the origin of the electroweak scale due to heavy-neutrino threshold corrections to the Higgs potential. In this paper, we show for the first time that all of these features of the type-I seesaw are compatible with each other. Integrating out a set of heavy Majorana neutrinos results in small masses for the Standard Model neutrinos; baryogenesis is accomplished by resonant leptogenesis; and the Higgs mass is entirely induced by heavy-neutrino one-loop diagrams, provided that the tree-level Higgs potential satisfies scale-invariant boundary conditions in the ultraviolet. The viable parameter space is characterized by a heavy-neutrino mass scale roughly in the range $10^{6.5\cdots7.0}$ GeV and a mass splitting among the nearly degenerate heavy-neutrino states up to a few TeV. Our findings have interesting implications for high-energy flavor models and low-energy neutrino observables. We conclude that the type-I seesaw sector might be the root cause behind the masses and cosmological abundances of all known particles. This statement might even extend to dark matter in the presence of a keV-scale sterile neutrino.","Vedran Brdar, Alexander J.

We show that the $\log M_* - \log S_K$ relation: (1)~is linear above limits set by properties of the samples and observations; (2)~has slightly different slope when derived from stellar or gas kinematic measurements; (3)~applies to both early-type and late-type galaxies and has smaller scatter than either the Tully-Fisher relation ($\log M_* - \log V_{rot}$) for late types or the Faber-Jackson relation ($\log M_* - \log\sigma$) for early types; and (4)~has scatter that is only weakly sensitive to the value of $K$, with minimum scatter for $K$ in the range 0.4 and 0.7. We compare $S_K$ to the aperture second moment (the `aperture velocity dispersion') measured from the integrated spectrum within a 3-arcsecond radius aperture ($\sigma_{3^{\prime\prime}}$).

The model is an extension of the Standard Model including two additional neutrinos, a singlet scalar and a fermionic dark matter. We consider the inverse seesaw mechanism where the mass of 2 additional neutrinos are made dynamics by the singlet scalar. We found that the natural scale for the scalar vacuum expectation value is naturally close to the weak scale. Motivating by this fact, we focus on the possibility of the singlet scalar connecting with dark matter, i.e., the scalar is also the mediator between dark sector and the Standard Model. We perform a numerical analysis over the parameter space subject to the indirect and direct detection constraints. The feasible region of the parameter space will be discussed.","Chakrit Pongkitivanichkul, Nakorn Thongyoi, Patipan Uttayarat","9 pages, 5 figures",1905.13224v1,No journal ref found,Patipan Uttayarat,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13224v1,2019-05-29 18:00:01+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,Inverse Seesaw and Portal Dark Matter,2019-05-29 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13224v1
694,"The Ophiuchus stream is a short arc-like stellar feature of uncertain origin located $\sim 5$ kpc North of the Galactic centre. New proper motions from the second $Gaia$ data release reconcile the direction of motion of stream members with the stream arc, resolving a puzzling mismatch reported in earlier work. We use N-body simulations to show that the stream is likely only on its second pericentric passage, and thus was formed recently. The simulations suggest that the entire disrupted progenitor is visible in the observed stream today, and that little further tidal debris lies beyond the ends of the stream. The luminosity, length, width, and velocity dispersion of the stream suggest a globular cluster (GC) progenitor substantially fainter and of lower surface brightness than estimated in previous work, and unlike any other known globulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the existence of clusters that would extend the known GC population to fainter and more weakly bound systems than hitherto known. How such a weakly-bound cluster of old stars survived until it was disrupted so recently, however, remains a mystery. Integrating backwards in time, we find that the orbits of Sagittarius and Ophiuchus passed within $\sim 5$ kpc of each other about $\sim 100$ Myrs ago, an interaction that might help resolve this puzzle.","James M.

Simultaneously, significant progresses have also been made in probing the symmetry energy in both terrestrial nuclear laboratories and astrophysical observatories.

696,"We study the destruction of interstellar dust via sputtering in supernova (SN) shocks using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. With a novel numerical framework, we follow both sputtering and dust dynamics governed by direct collisions, plasma drag and betatron acceleration. Grain-grain collisions are not included and the grain-size distribution is assumed to be fixed. The amount of dust destroyed per SN is quantified for a broad range of ambient densities and fitting formulae are provided. Integrated over the grain-size distribution, nonthermal (inertial) sputtering dominates over thermal sputtering for typical ambient densities. We present the first simulations that explicitly follow dust sputtering within a turbulent multiphase interstellar medium. We find that the dust destruction timescales $\tau$ are 0.35 Gyr for silicate dust and 0.44 Gyr for carbon dust in solar neighborhood conditions. The SN environment has an important impact on $\tau$. SNe that occur in preexisting bubbles destroy less dust as the destruction is limited by the amount of dust in the shocked gas. This makes $\tau$ about 2.5 times longer than the estimate based on results from a single SN explosion. We investigate the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio (DGR), and find that a spatial inhomogeneity of $\sim$ 14\% develops for scales below 10 pc. It locally correlates positively with gas density but negatively with gas temperature even in the exterior of the bubbles due to incomplete gas mixing. This leads to a $\sim$ 30\% lower DGR in the volume filling warm gas compared to that in the dense clouds.","Chia-Yu Hu, Svitlana Zhukovska, Rachel S.

697,"Recent additions to the population of Long-duration Gamma Ray Burst (LGRB) host galaxies with measured metallicities and host masses allow us to investigate how the distributions of both these properties change with redshift. We form a sample out to z of 2.5 which we show does not have strong redshift dependent populations biases in mass and metallicity measurements. Using this sample, we find a surprising lack of evolution in the LGRB metallicity distribution across different redshifts and in particular the fraction of LGRB hosts with relatively high-metallicity, that is those with 12+log(O/H) > 8.4, remains essentially constant out to z = 2.5. This result is at odds with the evolution in the mass metallicity relation of typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing redshift. By converting the measured LGRB host masses and redshifts to expected metallicities using redshift appropriate mass-metallicity relations, we further find that the increase in LGRB host galaxy mass distribution with redshift seen in the Perley et al. (2016) SHOALS sample is consistent with that needed to preserve a non-evolving LGRB metallicity distribution. However, the estimated LGRB host metallicity distribution is at least a quarter dex higher at all redshifts than the measured metallicity distribution. This corresponds to about a factor of two in raw metallicity and resolves much of the difference between the LGRB host metallicity cutoffs determined by Graham & Fruchter (2017) and Perley et al. (2016). As LGRB hosts do not follow the general mass metallicity relations, there is no substitute for actually measuring their metallicities.","J. F. Graham, P. Schady, A. S.

698,"We model millisecond pulsars winds colliding with radiatively-driven companion winds in black widow and redback systems. For the redbacks, the geometry of this intrabinary shock (IBS) is quite sensitive to the expected equatorial concentration in the pulsar outflow. We thus analytically extend IBS thin-shock models to $\sim \sin^{2n}\theta$ pulsar winds. We compute the synchrotron emission from such shocks, including the build-up and cooling of the particle population as it accelerates along the IBS. For reasonable parameters, this IBS flux dominates the binary emission in the X-ray band. The modeling shows subtle variation in spectrum across the IBS peak, accessible to sensitive X-ray studies. As example applications, we fit archival CXO/XMM data from the black widow pulsar J1959+2048 and the redback PSR J2339-0533, finding that the model reproduces well the orbital light curve profiles and energy spectra. The results show a very hard injected electron spectrum, indicating likely dominance by reconnection. The light curve fitting is sensitive to the geometric parameters, including the very important orbital inclination $i$. Coupled with optical fits of the companion star, such IBS X-ray light curve modeling can strongly constrain the binary geometry and the energetics of the MSP wind.","D. Kandel, Roger W.

699,"We study the stochastic formalism of inflation beyond the usual slow-roll approximation. We verify that the assumptions on which the stochastic formalism relies still hold even far from the slow-roll attractor. This includes demonstrating the validity of the separate universe approach to evolving long-wavelength scalar field perturbations beyond slow roll. We also explain that, in general, there is a gauge correction to the amplitude of the stochastic noise. This is because the amplitude is usually calculated in the spatially-flat gauge, while the number of e-folds is used as the time variable (hence one works in the uniform-$N$ gauge) in the Langevin equations. We show that these corrections vanish in the slow-roll limit, but we also explain how to calculate them in general. We compute them in difference cases, including ultra-slow roll and the Starobinsky model that interpolates between slow roll and ultra-slow roll, and find the corrections to be negligible in practice. This confirms the validity of the stochastic formalism for studying quantum backreaction effects in the very early universe beyond slow roll.","Chris Pattison, Vincent Vennin, Hooshyar Assadullahi, David Wands","21 pages without appendices (total 29 pages), 1 figure, references

This offset feeds into the energy density of Dark Matter. This mechanism is universal and can be implemented in a generic inflationary scenario. Phenomenology of the model is comprised of Dark Matter decay into inflatons, which in turn decay into Standard Model species triggering cascades of high energy particles contributing to the cosmic ray flux.

702,"We derive Bayesian distances for all stars in the RV sample of Gaia DR2, and use the statistical method of Schoenrich, Binney & Asplund(2012) to validate the distances and test the Gaia parallaxes. In contrast to other methods, which rely on special sources, our method directly tests the distances to all stars in our sample. We find clear evidence for a near-linear trend of distance bias f with distance s, proving a parallax offset delta p. On average, we find delta p = -0.054 mas (parallaxes in Gaia DR2 need to be increased) when accounting for the parallax uncertainty under-estimate in the Gaia set (delta p = -0.048 mas on the raw parallax errors) with negligible formal error and a systematic uncertainty of about 0.006 mas. The value is in concordance with results from asteroseismic measurements, but differs from the much lower bias found on quasar samples. We further use our method to compile a comprehensive set of quality cuts in colour, apparent magnitude, and astrometric parameters. Last, we find that for this sample delta p appears to strongly depend on the parallax uncertainty sigma_p (when including the additional 0.043 mas) with a statistical confidence far in excess of 10\sigma and a proportionality factor close to 1, though the dependence varies somewhat with sigma_p. Correcting for the sigma_p dependence also resolves otherwise unexplained correlations of the offset with the number of observation periods n_{vis} and ecliptic latitude.

We also show that at first order in perturbation theory there is no rotation of polarisation also for vector and tensor modes.,"Enea Di Dio, Ruth Durrer, Giuseppe Fanizza, Giovanni Marozzi","15 pages, 4 figures",1905.12573v1,No journal ref found,Giovanni Marozzi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12573v1,2019-05-29 16:32:48+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-th,Rotation of the CMB polarisation by foreground lensing,2019-05-29 16:32:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12573v1
704,"We analytically calculate the star formation efficiency and dense self-gravitating gas fraction in the presence of magneto-gravo-turbulence using the model of Burkhart (2018), which employs a piecewise lognormal and powerlaw density Probability Distribution Function (PDF). We show that the PDF transition density from lognormal to powerlaw forms is a mathematically motivated critical density for star formation and can be physically related to the density where the Jeans length is comparable to the sonic length, i.e. the post-shock critical density for collapse. When the PDF transition density is taken as the critical density, the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{\rm inst}$) and depletion time ($\tau_{\rm depl}$) can be calculated from the dense self-gravitating gas fraction represented as the fraction of gas in the PDF powerlaw tail. We minimize the number of free parameters in the analytic expressions for $\epsilon_{\rm inst}$ and $\tau_{\rm depl}$ by using the PDF transition density instead of a parameterized critical density for collapse and thus provide a more direct pathway for comparison with observations. We test the analytic predictions for the transition density and self-gravitating gas fraction against AREPO moving mesh gravoturbulent simulations and find good agreement. We predict that, when gravity dominates the density distribution in the star-forming gas, the star formation efficiency should be weakly anti-correlated with the sonic Mach number while the depletion time should increase with increasing sonic Mach number. The star formation efficiency and depletion time depend primarily on the dense self-gravitating gas fraction, which in turn depends on the interplay of gravity, turbulence and stellar feedback. Our model prediction is in agreement with recent observations, such as the M51 PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS).","Blakesley Burkhart, Philip Mocz",accepted to ApJ,1805.11104v3,No journal ref found,Philip Mocz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11104v3,2018-05-28 18:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The Self-gravitating Gas Fraction and The Critical Density for Star   Formation,2019-05-29 16:23:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11104v3
705,"The narrow main rings of Uranus are composed of almost exclusively centimeter- to meter-sized particles, with a very small or nonexistent dust component; however, the filling factor, composition, thickness, mass, and detailed particle size distribution of these rings remain poorly constrained. Using millimeter (1.3 - 3.1 mm) imaging from the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array and mid-infrared (18.7 $\mu$m) imaging from the Very Large Telescope VISIR instrument, we observed the thermal component of the Uranian ring system for the first time. The $\epsilon$ ring is detected strongly and can be seen by eye in the images; the other main rings are visible in a radial (azimuthally-averaged) profile at millimeter wavelengths. A simple thermal model similar to the NEATM model of near-Earth asteroids is applied to the $\epsilon$ ring to determine a ring particle temperature of $77.3 \pm 1.8$ K. The observed temperature is higher than expected for fast-rotating ring particles viewed at our observing geometry, meaning that the data favor a model in which the thermal inertia of the ring particles is low and/or their rotation rate is slow. The $\epsilon$ ring displays a factor of 2-3 brightness difference between periapsis and apoapsis, with $49.1 \pm 2.2$\% of sightlines through the ring striking a particle. These observations are consistent with optical and near-infrared reflected light observations, confirming the hypothesis that micron-sized dust is not present in the ring system.","Edward M.

706,"We study the post-inflation dynamics of multifield models involving nonminimal couplings using lattice simulations to capture significant nonlinear effects like backreaction and rescattering. By investigating the late-stage nonlinear dynamics, we measure the effective equation of state and typical time-scales for the onset of thermalization, quantities that could affect the usual mapping between predictions for primordial perturbation spectra and measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation. For large values of the nonminimal coupling constants, we find efficient particle production that gives rise to nearly instantaneous preheating. Moreover, the strong single-field attractor behavior that was identified for these models in linearized analyses remains robust in the full theory, and in all cases considered the attractor persists until the end of preheating. The persistence of the single-field attractor is significant because it suppresses typical signatures of multifield models. We therefore find that even taking into account the violent preheating phase after inflation, predictions for primordial observables in this class of models retain a close match to the latest observations.","Rachel Nguyen, Jorinde van de Vis, Evangelos I.

Furthermore, 23 periodic variables were found. We also detected four candidates for delta Scuti stars and 7 eclipsing binaries. Based on the mid-infrared Spitzer and WISE photometry and near infrared JHKs 2MASS photometry we classified 104 young stellar sources among our variables: 1 Class I object, 1 Class I/flat spectrum object, 4 flat spectrum objects, 91 Class II objects and 7 transition disk objects. This classification, together with r'i'H$alpha IPHAS photometry and JHK UKIDSS photometry, were used for identification of pre-main sequence stars among irregular and periodic variables. In this way, 97 CTTS candidates (96 irregular and one periodic variable), 68 WTTS candidates (54 irregular and 14 periodic variables) and 6 Herbig Ae/Be stars were found.

708,"Exoplanet properties crucially depend on their host stars' parameters. In case the exoplanet host star shows pulsations, asteroseismology can be used for an improved description of the stellar parameters. We aim to revisit the pulsational properties of beta Pic and identify its pulsation modes from normalised amplitudes in five different passbands. We also investigate the potential presence of a magnetic field. We conduct a frequency analysis using three seasons of BRITE-Constellation observations in the BRITE blue and red filters, the ~620-day long bRing light curve and the nearly 8-year long SMEI photometric time series. We calculate normalised amplitudes using all passbands including previously published values obtained from ASTEP observations. We investigate the magnetic properties of beta Pic using spectropolarimetric observations conducted with the HARPSpol instrument. Using 2D rotating models, we fit the normalised amplitudes and frequencies through Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We identify 15 pulsation frequencies in the range from 34 to 55c/d, where two display clear amplitude variability. We use the normalised amplitudes in up to five passbands to identify the modes as three l = 1, six l = 2 and six l = 3 modes. beta Pic is shown to be non-magnetic with an upper limit of the possible undetected dipolar field of 300G. Multiple fits to the frequencies and normalised amplitudes are obtained including one with a near equator-on inclination for beta Pic, which corresponds to our expectations based on the orbital inclination of beta Pic b and the orientation of the circumstellar disk. This solution leads to a rotation rate of 27% of the Keplerian break-up velocity, a radius of 1.497+-0.025Rsun, and a mass of 1.797+-0.035Msun. The ~2% errors in radius and mass do not account for uncertainties in the models and a potentially erroneous mode-identification.","K. Zwintz, D. R. Reese, C. Neiner, A. Pigulski, R. Kuschnig, M.

This mechanism relies on the choice of non-Bunch-Davies vacua, these leading to oscillatory features in the inflationary power spectrum. This in turn generates oscillations in the primordial black-hole mass function with exponentially enhanced spikes. This ``multimodal'' effect is demonstrated for most of the well-studied models of primordial black-hole formation.","Bernard Carr, Florian Kuhnel","18 pages, 5 figures; v2: minor changes to match published version",1811.06532v2,No journal ref found,Florian Kuhnel,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06532v2,2018-11-15 18:54:37+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Primordial Black Holes With Multi-Modal Mass Spectra,2019-05-29 15:45:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06532v2
710,"The detection of the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted in the capture process of a compact object by a massive black hole (MBH) is known as an extreme-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and represents a unique probe of gravity in the strong regime and is one of the main targets of LISA. The possibility of observing a compact-object EMRI at the Galactic Centre (GC) when LISA is taking data is very low. However, the capture of a brown dwarf (BD), an X-MRI, is more frequent because these objects are much more abundant and can plunge without being tidally disrupted. An X-MRI covers some $\sim 10^8$ cycles before merger, and hence stay on band for millions of years. About $2\times 10^6$ yrs before merger they have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the GC of 10, $10^4$ yrs several thousands, and $10^3$ yrs before the merger a few $10^4$. Based on these values, this kind of EMRIs are also detectable at neighbour MBHs, albeit with fainter SNRs. We calculate the event rate of X-MRIs at the GC taking into account the asymmetry of pro- and retrograde orbits on the location of the last stable orbit. We estimate that at any given moment, and using a conservative approach, there are of the order of $\gtrsim\,20$ sources in band. From these, $\gtrsim\,5$ are highly eccentric and are located at lower frequencies, and about $\gtrsim\,15$ are circular and are at higher frequencies. Due to their proximity, X-MRIs represent a unique probe of gravity in the strong regime. The mass ratio for a X-MRI at the GC is $q \sim 10^8$, i.e., three orders of magnitude larger than stellar-mass black hole EMRIs. Since backreaction depends on $q$, the orbit follows closer a standard geodesic, which means that approximations work better in the calculation of the orbit. X-MRIs can be sufficiently loud so as to track the systematic growth of their SNR, which can be high enough to bury that of MBH binaries.",Pau Amaro-Seoane,"Minor changes, accepted for publication at PRD.

711,"Energy consumption and hardware cost of signal digitization together with the management of the resulting data volume form serious issues for high-rate measurement systems with multiple sensors. Switching to binary sensing front-ends results in resource-efficient systems but is commonly associated with significant distortion due to the nonlinear signal acquisition. In particular, for applications that require to solve high-resolution processing tasks under extreme conditions, it is a widely held belief that low-complexity 1-bit analog-to-digital conversion leads to unacceptable performance degradation. In the Big Science context of radio astronomy, we propose a telescope architecture based on simplistic binary sampling, precise hardware-aware probabilistic modeling, and advanced statistical data processing. We sketch the main principles, system blocks and advantages of such a radio telescope system which we refer to as The Massive Binary Radio Lenses. The open engineering science questions which have to be answered before building a physical prototype are outlined. We set sail for the academic technology study by deriving an algorithm for interferometric imaging from binary radio array measurements. Without bias, the method aims at extracting the full discriminative information about the spatial power distribution embedded in a binary sensor data stream. We use radio measurements obtained with the LOFAR telescope to test the developed imaging technique and present visual and quantitative results.

712,"The primary advantage of moderately superheated bubble chamber detectors is their simultaneous sensitivity to nuclear recoils from WIMP dark matter and insensitivity to electron recoil backgrounds. A comprehensive analysis of PICO gamma calibration data demonstrates for the first time that electron recoils in C$_3$F$_8$ scale in accordance with a new nucleation mechanism, rather than one driven by a hot-spike as previously supposed. Using this semi-empirical model, bubble chamber nucleation thresholds may be tuned to be sensitive to lower energy nuclear recoils while maintaining excellent electron recoil rejection. The PICO-40L detector will exploit this model to achieve thermodynamic thresholds as low as 2.8 keV while being dominated by single-scatter events from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of solar neutrinos. In one year of operation, PICO-40L can improve existing leading limits from PICO on spin-dependent WIMP-proton coupling by nearly an order of magnitude for WIMP masses greater than 3 GeV c$^{-2}$ and will have the ability to surpass all existing non-xenon bounds on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon coupling for WIMP masses from 3 to 40 GeV c$^{-2}$.","C.

713,"Context. Bright stellar positions are now known with an uncertainty below 1 mas thanks to Gaia DR2. Between 2019-2020, the Galactic plane will be the background of Jupiter. The dense stellar background will lead to an increase in the number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the prediction uncertainties for the shadow path.   Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa (J2) and propose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons.   Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the occulted star and the object to determine the time when the flux dropped with respect to one or more reference stars, and the time that it rose again for each observational station. The chords obtained from these observations allowed us to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre accuracy.   Results. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa observed on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse presents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 $\pm$ 3.6 km and oblatenesses 0.0010 $\pm$ 0.0028. A very precise Europa position was determined with an uncertainty of 0.8 mas. We also present prospects for a campaign to observe the future events that will occur between 2019 and 2021 for all Galilean moons.   Conclusions. Stellar occultation is a suitable technique for obtaining physical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to their primary. A number of successful events can render the 3D shapes of the Galilean moons with high accuracy.

714,"We present TeV gamma-ray observations of the Crab Nebula, the standard reference source in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, using data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory. In this analysis we use two independent energy-estimation methods that utilize extensive air shower variables such as the core position, shower angle, and shower lateral energy distribution. In contrast, the previously published HAWC energy spectrum roughly estimated the shower energy with only the number of photomultipliers triggered. This new methodology yields a much improved energy resolution over the previous analysis and extends HAWC's ability to accurately measure gamma-ray energies well beyond 100 TeV. The energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula is well fit to a log parabola shape $\left(\frac{dN}{dE} = \phi_0 \left(E/\textrm{7 TeV}\right)^{-\alpha-\beta\ln\left(E/\textrm{7 TeV}\right)}\right)$ with emission up to at least 100 TeV. For the first estimator, a ground parameter that utilizes fits to the lateral distribution function to measure the charge density 40 meters from the shower axis, the best-fit values are $\phi_o$=(2.35$\pm$0.04$^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$)$\times$10$^{-13}$ (TeV cm$^2$ s)$^{-1}$, $\alpha$=2.79$\pm$0.02$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$, and $\beta$=0.10$\pm$0.01$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$.

715,Context: The dust-brightness phase curves that have been measured by the OSIRIS cameras on board the Rosetta spacecraft within the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) present a remarkable u-shape. Aims: Our goal is to compare these phase curves with those of tentatively analog dust samples to assess the key dust properties that might induce this shape. Methods: Light-scattering measurements have been made with the PROGRA2 instrument in the laboratory and in microgravity conditions on samples of different physical properties and compositions that are likely to be representative of cometary dust particles. Results: We find that the brightness phase curves of a series of interplanetary dust analogs that have been recently developed (to fit the polarimetric properties of the inner zodiacal cloud and their changes with heliocentric distance) are quite comparable to those of 67P. Key dust properties seem to be related to the composition and the porosity. Conclusions: We conclude that the shape of the brightness phase curves of 67P has to be related to the presence of a significant amount of organic compounds (at least 50% in mass) and of fluffy aggregates (of a size range of 10 to 200 microns). We also confirm similarities between the dust particles of this Jupiter-family comet and the particles within the inner zodiacal cloud.,"Anny-Chantal Levasseur-Regourd, Jean-Baptiste Renard, Edith Hadamcik, Jeremie Lasue, Ivano Bertini, Marco Fulle","6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &

Constant roll solutions are a generalization of the ultra-slow roll (USR) solution, where the first Hubble slow roll parameter $\epsilon$ is small, but the second Hubble slow roll parameter $\eta$ is not. While it is known that the USR solutions represent dynamical transients, there has been some disagreement in literature about whether or not large-$\eta$ constant roll solutions are attractors or are also a class of transient solutions. In this paper we show that the large-$\eta$ constant roll solutions do in fact represent transient solutions by performing stability analysis on the exact analytic (large-$\eta$) constant roll solutions.","Wei-Chen Lin, Michael J.

717,"Context. The precise determination of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe, expressed through the Hubble constant $H_0$, is one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM, $H_0$ inference at high redshift using cosmic-microwave-background data from Planck disagrees at the 4.4$\sigma$ level with measurements based on the local distance ladder made up of parallaxes, Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), often referred to as ""Hubble tension"". Independent, cosmological-model-insensitive ways to infer $H_0$ are of critical importance. Aims. We apply an inverse-distance-ladder approach, combining strong-lensing time-delay-distance measurements with SN Ia data. By themselves, SNe Ia are merely good relative distance indicators, but by anchoring them to strong gravitational lenses one can obtain an $H_0$ measurement that is relatively insensitive to other cosmological parameters. Methods. A cosmological parameter estimate is performed for different cosmological background models, both for strong-lensing data alone and for the combined lensing + SNe Ia data sets. Results. The cosmological-model dependence of strong-lensing $H_0$ measurements is significantly mitigated through the inverse distance ladder. In combination with SN Ia data, the inferred $H_0$ consistently lies around 73-74 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed cosmological background model. Our results agree nicely with those from the local distance ladder, but there is a >2$\sigma$ tension with Planck results, and a ~1.5$\sigma$ discrepancy with results from an inverse distance ladder including Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and SNe Ia. Future strong-lensing distance measurements will reduce the uncertainties in $H_0$ from our inverse distance ladder.","S. Taubenberger, S. H. Suyu, E. Komatsu, I. Jee, S. Birrer, V. Bonvin, F.

718,"Ultra hot Jupiters orbit very close to their host star and consequently receive strong irradiation that makes their atmospheric chemistry different from the common gas giants. Here, we study the atmosphere of one of these particular hot planets, MASCARA-2b/KELT-20b, using four transit observations with high resolution spectroscopy facilities. Three of these observations were performed with HARPS-N and one with CARMENES. We simultaneously observed one of the transits with MuSCAT2 to monitor possible spots in the stellar surface. At high resolution, the transmission residuals show the effects of Rossiter-McLaughlin and center-to-limb variations from the stellar lines profiles, which we correct to finally extract the transmission spectra of the planet. We clearly observe absorption of CaII, FeII, NaI, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, and indications of H$\gamma$ and MgI at low SNR. The results obtained with CARMENES and HARPS-N are consistent, measuring an H$\alpha$ absorption depth of $0.68\pm0.05\%$ and $0.59\pm0.07\%$, and NaI absorption of $0.11\pm0.04\%$ and $0.09\pm0.05\%$ ($0.75\r{A}$ passband), in both instruments respectively. For H$\beta$ only HARPS-N covers this wavelength range, measuring $0.28\pm0.06\%$ of absorption. The CaII is only covered with CARMENES, measuring an average absorption of $0.32\pm0.05\%$. Three additional FeII lines are observed in the transmission spectrum by HARPS-N, with mean absorption depth of $0.08\pm0.04\%$. The results presented here are consistent with theoretical models of ultra hot Jupiters atmospheres, suggesting the emergence of an ionised gas on the day-side of such planets. Ca and Fe, with other elements, are expected to be singly ionised at these temperatures and be more numerous than its neutral state. The CaII triplet lines are detected here for the first time in transmission in an exoplanet atmosphere.","N. Casasayas-Barris, E. Palle, F. Yan, G. Chen, S. Kohl, M. Stangret, H. Parviainen, Ch.

719,"Primordial gravitational waves are said to be a smoking gun of cosmic inflation, while, even if it is detected, the specification of their origins will still be required for establishing the true inflationary model. Testing non-Gaussianity in the tensor-mode anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is one of the most powerful ways to achieve it. In this paper, we review the studies on the tensor non-Gaussianity search employing the CMB bispectrum and forecast future developments. We then recognize that, no significant signal has so far been found from temperature and E-mode polarization data, while some orders-of-magnitude improvement in detection limit can be expected by adding the information of B-mode polarization, and there is already an established methodology for bispectrum estimation.

720,"We study the impact of non-standard momentum distributions of cosmic neutrinos on the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and the matter power spectrum of the large scale structure. We show that the neutrino distribution has almost no unique observable imprint, as it is almost entirely degenerate with the effective number of neutrino flavours, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and the neutrino mass, $m_{\nu}$. Performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with current cosmological data, we demonstrate that the neutrino mass bound heavily depends on the assumed momentum distribution of relic neutrinos. The message of this work is simple and has to our knowledge not been pointed out clearly before: Cosmology allows that neutrinos have larger masses if their average momentum is larger than that of a perfectly thermal distribution. Here we provide an example in which the mass limits are relaxed by a factor of two.","Isabel M. Oldengott, Gabriela Barenboim, Sarah Kahlen, Jordi Salvado, Dominik J.

722,"High-mass analogues of low-mass prestellar cores are searched for to constrain the models of high-mass star formation. Several high-mass cores, at various evolutionary stages, have been recently identified towards the massive star-forming region W43-MM1 and amongst them a high-mass prestellar core candidate. We aim to characterise the chemistry in this high-mass prestellar core candidate, referred to as W43-MM1 core #6, and its environment. Using ALMA high-spatial resolution data of W43-MM1, we have studied the molecular content of core #6 and a neighbouring high-mass protostellar core, referred to as #3, which is similar in size and mass to core #6. We first subtracted the continuum emission using a method based on the density distribution of the intensities on each pixel. Then, from the distribution of detected molecules, we identified the molecules centred on the prestellar core candidate (core #6) and those associated to shocks related to outflows and filament formation. Then we constrained the column densities and temperatures of the molecules detected towards the two cores. While core #3 appears to contain a hot core with a temperature of about 190 K, core #6 seems to have a lower temperature in the range from 20 K to 90 K from a rotational diagram analysis. We have considered different source sizes for core #6 and the comparison of the abundances of the detected molecules towards the core with various interstellar sources shows that it is compatible with a core of size 1000 au with $T = 20-90$ K or a core of size 500 au with $T \sim 80$ K. Core #6 of W43-MM1 remains one of the best high-mass prestellar core candidates even if we cannot exclude that it is at the very beginning of the protostellar phase of high-mass star formation.","J.

723,"Modified gravity (MG) theories aim to reproduce the observed acceleration of the universe reducing the dark sector, while simultaneously recovering General Relativity (GR) within dense environments. Void studies appear as a suitable scenario to search for imprints of alternative gravity models on cosmological scales. Voids cover an interesting range of density scales where screening mechanisms fade out, going from a density contrast delta ~ -1 close to their centers to delta ~ 0 close to their boundaries. We present an analysis of the level of distinction between GR and two modified gravity theories, Hu-Sawicki f(R) and Symmetron. This study relays on the abundance, linear-bias and density-profile of voids detected in N-body cosmological simulations. We define voids as connected regions made up of the union of spheres with 'mean' density given by rho_v = 0.2 rho_m, but disconnected from any other voids. We find that the height of void walls is sensibly affected by the gravitational theory, such that it increases for stronger gravity modifications. Finally, we show that at the level of dark matter N-body simulations, our constraints allow us to distinguish between GR and MG models with |f_{R0}| > 10^{-6} and z_{SSB} > 1. Tensions on best-fit values for MG parameters derived independently from multiple void probes may indicate an incorrect MG model, serving as an important consistency check.","Eder L D Perico, Rodrigo Voivodic, Marcos Lima, David F Mota",No comment found,1905.12450v1,No journal ref found,David F Mota,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12450v1,2019-05-29 13:40:01+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Cosmic Voids in Modified Gravity Scenarios,2019-05-29 13:40:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12450v1

725,"Aims: The long-term carbon cycle for planets with a surface entirely covered by oceans works differently from that of the present-day Earth because inefficient erosion leads to a strong dependence of the weathering rate on the rate of volcanism. In this paper, we investigate the long-term carbon cycle for these planets throughout their evolution. Methods: We built box models of the long-term carbon cycle based on CO$_2$ degassing, seafloor-weathering, metamorphic decarbonation, and ingassing and coupled them with thermal evolution models of stagnant lid and plate tectonics planets. Results: The assumed relationship between the seafloor-weathering rate and the atmospheric CO$_2$ or the surface temperature strongly influences the climate evolution for both tectonic regimes. For a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure is characterised by an equilibrium between ingassing and degassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones affecting the stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and degassing are always accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined carbon content of the crust and atmosphere increases with time. Whereas the initial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only affects the early evolution, it influences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant lid planets for much longer. Conclusions: For both tectonic regimes, mantle cooling results in a decreasing atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure. For a plate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing fraction of subduction zones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this is caused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly compensate for the increase of the surface temperature due to increasing solar luminosity with time and hereby contribute to keep planets habitable in the long-term.","Dennis Höning, Nicola Tosi, Tilman Spohn",No comment found,1905.12392v1,No journal ref found,Tilman Spohn,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12392v1,2019-05-29 13:00:32+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Carbon cycling and interior evolution of water-covered plate tectonics   and stagnant lid planets,2019-05-29 13:00:32+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12392v1

In particular, this implies statistical isotropy in the galaxy distribution, after removal of a dipole anisotropy due to the observer's motion. We test this hypothesis with radio count maps from the NVSS radio catalogue. We use a local variance estimator based on patches of different angular radii across the sky, and compare the source count variance between and within these patches. We also define different criteria to eliminate patches with masked pixels. In order to assess the statistical significance of our results, we simulate radio maps with the NVSS specifications.

727,"Small dust grains are essential ingredients of star, disk and planet formation. We present an Eulerian numerical approach to study small dust grains dynamics in the context of star and protoplanetary disk formation. It is designed for finite volume codes. We use it to investigate dust dynamics during the protostellar collapse. We present a method to solve the monofluid equations of gas and dust mixtures with several dust species in the diffusion approximation implemented in the adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES. It uses a finite volume second-order Godunov method with a predictor-corrector MUSCL scheme to estimate the fluxes between the grid cells. We benchmark our method against six distinct tests, dustyadvect, dustydiffuse, dustyshock, dustywave, settling and dustycollapse. We show that the scheme is second-order accurate in space on uniform grids and intermediate between second and first-order on non-uniform grids. We apply our method on various dustycollapse simulations of 1 solar mass cores composed of gas and dust. We developed an efficient approach to treat gas and dust dynamics in the diffusion regime on grid based codes. The canonical tests have been successfully passed. In the context of protostellar collapse, we show that dust is less coupled to the gas in the outer regions of the collapse where grains larger than approximately 100 micrometers fall significantly faster than the gas.","Ugo Lebreuilly, Benoît Commerçon, Guillaume Laibe","Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 17 pages, 18

728,"We present the results of a model-independent investigation of the rest-frame UV spectra from a comprehensive sample of $394$ quasars in the redshift range $1.5\leq z \leq 7.5$. We fit the main Broad Emission Lines (BELs) in the rest-frame range $1280 \text{\AA} \leq \lambda \leq 3000 \text{\AA}$ (O I, C II, Si IV, C III, C IV and Mg II) with a lightly-supervised spline fitting technique. Redshifts are derived from the peaks of each fitted BEL and used to compute relative velocity shifts. We show that our method gives unbiased velocity shifts and is insensitive to spectral resolution and instrumental parameters. It is found that the average blueshift of the \cfour\, line with respect to several low-ionisation lines in luminosity-matched samples does not significantly evolve over $1.5\gtrsim z\gtrsim6$. However, the average blueshift increases significantly by a factor $\sim 2.5$ at $z\gtrsim 6$. We propose that this redshift evolution can be explained by \cfour\, winds launched perpendicularly to an accretion disk with increased torus opacity at high-redshift, coupled with a potential orientation-driven selection bias.

729,"Broad-line type Ic Supernovae (BL-Ic SNe) are characterized by high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$) and are sometimes associated with the relativistic jets typical of long duration ($\gtrsim 2$ s) Gamma-Ray Bursts (L-GRBs). The reason why a small fraction of BL-Ic SNe harbor relativistic jets is not known. Here we present deep X-ray and radio observations of the BL-Ic SN2014ad extending from $13$ to $930$ days post explosion. SN2014ad was not detected at either frequency and has no observational evidence of a GRB counterpart. The proximity of SN2014ad ($d\sim 26$ Mpc) enables very deep constraints on the progenitor mass-loss rate $\dot{M}$ and on the total energy of the fast ejecta $E$. We consider two synchrotron emission scenarios for a wind-like circumstellar medium (CSM): (i) uncollimated non-relativistic ejecta, and (ii) off-axis relativistic jet. Within the first scenario our observations are consistent with GRB-less BL-Ic SNe characterized by a modest energy budget of their fast ejecta ($E \lesssim 10^{45}$ erg), like SNe 2002ap and 2010ay. For jetted explosions, we cannot rule out a GRB with $E \lesssim 10^{51}$ erg (beam-corrected) with a narrow opening angle ($\theta_j \sim 5^{\circ}$) observed moderately off-axis ($\theta_{\rm obs} \gtrsim 30^{\circ}$) and expanding in a very low CSM density ($\dot{M}$ $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Our study shows that off-axis low-energy jets expanding in a low-density medium cannot be ruled out even in the most nearby BL-Ic SNe with extensive deep observations, and might be a common feature of BL-Ic SNe.","M.

730,"Using newly obtained high-resolution data ($R\sim{1\times{10}^{5}}$) from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, and archival UV data from the \textit{Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer} we have conducted a detailed UV survey of the three hot, metal-polluted white dwarfs WD0455-282, WD0621-376, and WD2211-495. Using bespoke model atmospheres we measured $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, log $g$, and photospheric abundances for these stars. In conjunction with data from Gaia we measured masses, radii, and gravitational redshift velocities for our sample of objects. We compared the measured photospheric abundances with those predicted by radiative levitation theory, and found that the observed Si abundances in all three white dwarfs, and the observed Fe abundances in WD0621-376 and WD2211-495, were larger than those predicted by an order of magnitude. These findings imply not only an external origin for the metals, but also ongoing accretion, as the metals not supported by radiative levitation would sink on extremely short timescales. We measured the radial velocities of several absorption features along the line of sight to the three objects in our sample, allowing us to determine the velocities of the photospheric and interstellar components along the line of sight for each star. Interestingly, we made detections of circumstellar absorption along the line of sight to WD0455-282 with three velocity components. To our knowledge, this is the first such detection of multi-component circumstellar absorption along the line of sight to a white dwarf.","S. P. Preval, M. A. Barstow, M. Bainbridge, N. Reindl, T.

732,"We discuss the possibility of realising a multi-component dark matter scenario with widely separated dark matter masses: one having keV scale mass and the other with GeV-TeV scale mass, within the framework of left right symmetric models. Due to gauge interactions, both the dark matter candidates are produced thermally in the early Universe but overproducing the keV mass candidate. We consider one of the right handed neutrinos to be decaying at late epochs, just before the big bang nucleosynthesis, in order to dilute the thermally overproduced keV dark matter. We constrain the parameter space from the requirement of producing sub-dominant keV-TeV dark matter, satisfying indirect detection constraints from gamma ray searches and producing the tantalising 3.55 keV monochromatic X-ray line, reported by several groups to be present in galaxy and galaxy cluster data, from the decay of a 7.1 keV dark matter on cosmological scales. We find that these requirements can keep the right sector gauge boson masses around a few TeV while requiring some of the right-handed neutrinos in the sub-GeV regime.","Debasish Borah, Arnab Dasgupta","Version 2: text rearranged, figures redrawn, 42 pages, 12 figures,

Understanding the properties across this population, and how those properties change with size, will yield useful constraints on the environment in which these TNOs formed, as well as their dynamical evolution, and bulk interior composition. TNO surface characteristics are ideal for study with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which provides imaging and spectroscopic capabilities from 0.6 to 28 $\mu$m. The four available science instruments, MIRI, NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec, and their capabilities for the study of TNOs, are presented. JWST will expand on the wavelength range observable from the ground in the near-infrared (0.6-5 $\mu$m) for compositional studies and will open a new window on TNOs in the mid-infrared (5-28 $\mu$m) for thermal characterization.","Noemí Pinilla-Alonso, John Stansberry, Bryan Holler","Chapter to be published in the book ""The Transneptunian Solar

734,"A rather minimal possibility is that dark matter consists of the gauge bosons of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Here we explore the possibility of detecting the gravitational waves produced by the phase transition associated with such breaking. Concretely, we focus on the scenario based on an $SU(2)_D$ group and argue that it is a case study for the sensitivity of future gravitational wave observatories to phase transitions associated with dark matter. This is because there are few parameters and those fixing the relic density also determine the effective potential establishing the strength of the phase transition. Particularly promising for LISA and even the Einstein Telescope is the super-cool dark matter regime, with DM masses above $\mathcal{O}$(100) TeV, for which we find that the gravitational wave signal is notably strong. In our analysis, we include the effect of astrophysical foregrounds, which are often ignored in the context of phase transitions.","Iason Baldes, Camilo Garcia-Cely","30 pages, 12 figures",1809.01198v2,No journal ref found,Camilo Garcia-Cely,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01198v2,2018-09-04 18:57:44+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Strong gravitational radiation from a simple dark matter model,2019-05-29 09:54:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01198v2
735,"We have observed the Andromeda galaxy, Messier 31 (M31), at 6.7GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope. We mapped the radio emission in the C-band, re-analyzed WMAP and Planck maps, as well as other ancillary data, and we have derived an overall integrated flux density spectrum from the radio to the infrared. This allowed us to estimate the emission budget from M31. Integrating over the whole galaxy, we found strong and highly significant evidence for anomalous microwave emission (AME), at the level of (1.45+0.17-0.19)Jy at the peaking frequency of ~25GHz. Decomposing the spectrum into known emission mechanisms such as free-free, synchrotron, thermal dust, and AME arising from electric dipole emission from rapidly rotating dust grains, we found that the overall emission from M31 is dominated, at frequencies below 10GHz, by synchrotron emission with a spectral index of -1.10+0.10-0.08, with subdominant free-free emission. At frequencies >10GHz, AME has a similar intensity to that of synchrotron and free-free emission, overtaking them between 20GHz and 50GHz, whereas thermal dust emission dominates the emission budget at frequencies above 60GHz, as expected.","E.

Two related scenarios for reconciling quantum mechanics with the existence of black hole-like objects, with ""minimal"" departure from general relativity and local quantum field theory, have been explored; one of these could produce signatures visible to EHT observations. A specific target is temporal variability of images, with a characteristic time scale determined by the classical black hole radius.

737,"Recent simulation studies suggest that the supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in the early universe may precede the prolonged intense star formation within its host galaxy, instead of quasars appearing after the obscured dusty star formation phase. If so, high-redshift quasars with low Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) would be found in actively star-forming hosts with a star formation rate (SFR) of $>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We present the sub-mm observations of IMS J2204+0112, a faint quasar with a quasar bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}=4.2\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$ and a low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ of only 0.1 at $z\sim6$, carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). From its sub-mm fluxes, we measure the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR}=(3$--$4)\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$. Interestingly, the derived host galaxy's SFR is $\sim500$--$700~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than those of the $L_{\rm bol}$-matched $z\gtrsim6$ quasars with high $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$. Similar FIR excesses are also found for five $z\gtrsim6$ low-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ quasars ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}<0.2$) in the literature. We show that the overall SFR, $M_{\rm BH}$, and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ distributions of these and other sub-mm-detected quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ can be explained with the evolutionary track of high-redshift quasars in a simulation study where low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ and high SFR quasars are expected at the end of the SMBH growth. This suggests that the nuclear activities of the low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, high $L_{\rm FIR}$ quasars are on the brink of being turned off, while their host galaxies continue to form the bulk of their stars at SFR $>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.","Yongjung Kim, Myungshin Im","15 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

Due to the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling, it happens relatively late in the history of the Universe. We compute the equilibration rate at leading order in the Standard Model couplings, by including gauge interactions, the top Yukawa- and the Higgs self-interaction. The dominant contribution is due to $ 2 \to 2 $ particle scattering, even though the rate of (inverse) Higgs decays is strongly enhanced by multiple soft scattering which is included by Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) resummation.

739,"We present a multi-wavelength study of the Planck cold clump G181.84+0.31, which is located at the northern end of the extended filamentary structure S242. We have extracted 9 compact dense cores from the SCUBA-2 850 um map, and we have identified 18 young stellar objects (YSOs, 4 Class I and 14 Class II) based on their Spitzer, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) near- and mid-infrared colours. The dense cores and YSOs are mainly distributed along the filamentary structures of G181.84 and are well traced by HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) spectral-line emission. We find signatures of sequential star formation activities in G181.84: dense cores and YSOs located in the northern and southern sub-structures are younger than those in the central region. We also detect global velocity gradients of about 0.8$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ and 1.0$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ along the northern and southern sub-structures, respectively, and local velocity gradients of 1.2$\pm$0.1 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ in the central substructure. These results may be due to the fact that the global collapse of the extended filamentary structure S242 is driven by an edge effect, for which the filament edges collapse first and then further trigger star formation activities inward. We identify three substructures in G181.84 and estimate their critical masses per unit length, which are $\sim$ 101$\pm$15 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, 56$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$ and 28$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are all lower than the observed values ($\sim$ 200 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$), suggesting that these sub-structures are gravitationally unstable.","Lixia Yuan, Ming Zhu, Tie Liu, Jinghua Yuan, Yuefang Wu, Kee-Tae Kim, Ke Wang, Chenlin Zhou, Ken'ichi Tatematsu, Nario Kuno","20 pages, 17 figures, article, accepted",1905.12258v1,No journal ref found,Nario Kuno,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12258v1,2019-05-29 07:47:23+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.GA,Sequential Star Formation in the filamentary structures of Planck   Galactic cold clump G181.84+0.31,2019-05-29 07:47:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12258v1

The release includes data from 174 nights of observation through January 2018. The Wide layer data cover about 300 deg^2 in all five broadband filters (grizy) to the nominal survey exposure (10min in gr and 20min in izy). Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100 deg^2 is observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the i-band is 0.6 arcsec, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The Deep (26 deg^2) and UltraDeep (4 deg^2) data are jointly processed and the UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of i~28 at 5 sigma for point sources. In addition to the broad-bands, narrow-band data are also available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog products are available for download. The catalogs are also loaded to a database, which provides an easy interface for users to retrieve data for objects of interest. In addition to these main data products, detailed galaxy shape measurements withheld from the Public Data Release 1 (PDR1) are now available to the community. The shape catalog is drawn from the S16A internal release, which has a larger area than PDR1 (160 deg^2).

746,"We study the effects of ambipolar diffusion (AD) on hydromagnetic turbulence. In most of the cases, we use the single fluid approximation where the drift velocity between charged and neutral particles is proportional to the Lorentz force. In two cases we also compare with the corresponding two-fluid model, where ionization and recombination are included in the continuity and momentum equations for the neutral and charged species. We consider the regime of large magnetic Prandtl number, relevant to the interstellar medium. The magnetic field properties are found to be well represented by the single fluid approximation. We quantify the effects of AD on total and spectral kinetic and magnetic energies, the Ohmic and AD dissipation rates, the statistics of the magnetic field, the current density, and the linear polarization as measured by the rotationally invariant E and B mode polarizations. We show that the kurtosis of the magnetic field decreases with increasing AD. The E mode polarization changes its skewness from positive values for small AD to negative ones for large AD. Even when AD is weak, changes in AD have a marked effect on the skewness and kurtosis of E, and only a weak effect on those of B. These results open the possibility of employing E and B mode polarizations as diagnostic tools for characterizing turbulent properties of the interstellar medium.",Axel Brandenburg,"13 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, MNRAS, in press",1903.08976v3,No journal ref found,Axel Brandenburg,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08976v3,2019-03-21 13:15:05+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Ambipolar diffusion in large Prandtl number turbulence,2019-05-29 02:33:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08976v3
747,"Studies of the ages, abundances, and motions of individual stars in the Milky Way provide one of the best ways to study the evolution of disk galaxies over cosmic time. The formation of the Milky Way's barred inner region in particular is a crucial piece of the puzzle of disk galaxy evolution. Using data from APOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the kinematics, elemental abundances, and age of the Milky Way bulge and disk that show the barred structure of the inner Milky Way in unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely kinematic determination of the bar's pattern speed of 41+/-3 km/s/kpc and of its shape and radial profile. We find the bar's age, metallicity, and abundance ratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the disk that are formed in its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the bulge outside of the bar are younger and more metal-rich. This implies that the bar likely formed ~8 Gyr ago, when the decrease in turbulence in the gas disk allowed a thin disk to form that quickly became bar-unstable. The bar's formation therefore stands as a crucial epoch in the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line with the evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics in external disk galaxies over the last ~10 Gyr.","Jo Bovy, Henry W.

748,"Rotation measure (RM) synthesis maps of NGC 4631 show remarkable sign reversals with distance from the minor axis in the northern halo of the galaxy on kpc scales. To explain this new phenomenon, we solve the dynamo equations under the assumption of scale invariance and search for rotating logarithmic spiral solutions. Solutions for velocity fields representing accretion onto the disk, outflow from the disk, and rotation-only in the disk are found that produce RM with reversing signs viewed edge-on. Model RM maps are created for a variety of input parameters using a Faraday screen and are scaled to the same amplitude as the observational maps. Residual images are then made and compared to find a best fit. Solutions for rotation-only, i.e. relative to a pattern uniform rotation, did in general, not fit the observations of NGC 4631 well. However, outflow models did provide a reasonable fit to the magnetic field. The best results for the specific region that was modelled in the northern halo are found with accretion. Since there is abundant evidence for both winds and accretion in NGC 4631, this modelling technique has the potential to distinguish between the dominant flows in galaxies.","Alex Woodfinden, Richard Henriksen, Judith Irwin, Silvia Carolina Mora-Partiarroyo","20 pages, 16 figures.

749,"In the early stages of star formation, a protostar is deeply embedded in an optically thick envelope such that it is not directly observable. Variations in the protostellar accretion rate, however, will cause luminosity changes that are reprocessed by the surrounding envelope and are observable at submillimeter wavelengths. We searched for submillimeter flux variability toward twelve Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) detected by the JCMT-SCOPE survey. These observations were conducted at 850 $\mu \rm m$ using the JCMT/SCUBA-2. Each field was observed three times over about fourteen months between 2016 April and 2017 June. We applied a relative flux calibration and achieved a calibration uncertainty of $\sim 3.6$% on average. We identified 136 clumps across twelve fields and detected four sources with flux variations of $\sim 30$%. For three of these sources, the variations appear to be primarily due to large-scale contamination, leaving one plausible candidate. The flux change of the candidate may be associated with low- or intermediate-mass star formation assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that it is a random deviation. Further studies with dedicated monitoring would provide a better understanding of the detailed relationship between submillimeter flux and accretion rate variabilities while enhancing the search for variability in star-forming clumps farther away than the Gould Belt.","Geumsook Park, Kee-Tae Kim, Doug Johnstone, Sung-ju Kang, Tie Liu, Steve Mairs, Minho Choi, Jeong-Eun Lee, Patricio Sanhueza, Mika Juvela, Miju Kang, David Eden, Archana Soam, Julien Montillaud, Gary Fuller, Patrick M.

752,"We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discovery of three terrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- a bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using the Gaia-measured distance and broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with the TESS transits from three sectors, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii ranging from 0.8REarth to 1.6REarth. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data Validation Report and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright (V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be observed in 4 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional planets in the system.","Veselin B.

753,"We present a study of the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of clusters at $0.05 \leq z<0.35$ from the SDSS and WISE with halo masses in the range $6 \times 10^{13}M_\odot$ (massive groups) - $10^{15.5}M_\odot$ (Coma-like clusters). We analyse optical and infrared colours and stellar masses of BCGs as a function of the mass of their host haloes. We find that BCGs are mostly red and quiescent galaxies and that a minority ($\sim 9$\%) of them are star-forming. We find that the optical $g-r$ colours are consistent with those of red sequence galaxies at the same redshifts; however, we detect the presence of a tail of blue and mostly star-forming BCGs preferentially located in low-mass clusters and groups. Although the blue tail is dominated by star-forming galaxies, we find that star-forming BCGs may also have red $g-r$ colours, indicating dust-enshrouded star formation. The fraction of star-forming BCGs increases with redshift and decreases with cluster mass and BCG stellar mass. We find that cool-core clusters host both star-forming and quiescent BCGs; however, non cool-core clusters are dominated by quiescent BCGs. Star formation appears thus as the result of processes that depend on stellar mass, cluster mass and cooling state of the intra-cluster medium. Our results suggest no significant stellar mass growth at $z<0.35$, supporting the notion that BCGs had accreted most of their mass by $z = 0.35$. Overall we find a low (1\%) AGN fraction detected at IR wavelengths.","Pierluigi Cerulo, Gustavo A.

755,"A minority of the optically selected quasar population are red at optical wavelengths due to the presence of dust along the line-of-sight. A key focus of many red quasar studies is to understand their relationship with the overall quasar population: are they blue quasars observed at a (slight) inclination angle or do they represent a transitional phase in the evolution of quasars? Identifying fundamental differences between red and blue quasars is key to discriminate between these two paradigms. To robustly explore this, we have uniformly selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with mid-infrared counterparts, carefully controlling for luminosity and redshift effects. We take a novel approach to distinguish between colour-selected quasars in the redshift range of $0.2 < z < 2.4$ by constructing redshift-sensitive $g^* - i^*$ colour cuts. From cross-matching this sample to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we have found a factor $\approx$ 3 larger fraction of radio-detected red quasars with respect to that of blue quasars. Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images and an assessment of the radio luminosities (rest-frame ${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}$ and ${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}/{L_{\rm 6\mu m}}$) we find that the radio-detection excess for red quasars is primarily due to compact and radio-faint systems (around the radio quiet--radio loud threshold). We show that our results rule out orientation as the origin for the differences between red and blue quasars and argue that they provide broad agreement with an evolutionary model.","Lizelke Klindt, David M.

756,"Most known trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) gravitationally scattering off the giant planets have orbital inclinations consistent with an origin from the classical Kuiper belt, but a small fraction of these ""scattering TNOs"" have inclinations that are far too large (i > 45 deg) for this origin. These scattering outliers have previously been proposed to be interlopers from the Oort cloud or evidence of an undiscovered planet. Here we test these hypotheses using N-body simulations and the 69 centaurs and scattering TNOs detected in the Outer Solar Systems Origins Survey and its predecessors. We confirm that observed scattering objects cannot solely originate from the classical Kuiper belt, and we show that both the Oort cloud and a distant planet generate observable highly inclined scatterers. Although the number of highly inclined scatterers from the Oort Cloud is ~3 times less than observed, Oort cloud enrichment from the Sun's galactic migration or birth cluster could resolve this. Meanwhile, a distant, low-eccentricity 5 Earth-mass planet replicates the observed fraction of highly inclined scatterers, but the overall inclination distribution is more excited than observed. Furthermore, the distant planet generates a longitudinal asymmetry among detached TNOs that is less extreme than often presumed, and its direction reverses across the perihelion range spanned by known TNOs. More complete models that explore the dynamical origins of the planet are necessary to further study these features. With observational biases well-characterized, our work shows that the orbital distribution of detected scattering bodies is a powerful constraint on the unobserved distant solar system.","Nathan A.

758,"We studied the correlation between brightness and polarization variations in 3C~279 at different wavelengths, over time intervals long enough to cover the time lags due to opacity effects. We used these correlations together with VLBI images to constrain the radio and high energy source position.We made 7 mm radio continuum and $R$-band polarimetric observations of 3C~279 between 2009 and 2014. The radio observations were performed at the Itapetinga Radio Observatory, while the polarimetric data were obtained at Pico dos Dias Observatory, both in Brazil. We compared our observations with the $\gamma$-ray Fermi/LAT and $R$-band SMARTS light curves. We found a good correlation between 7~mm and $R$-band light curves, with a delay of $170 \pm 30$ days in radio, but no correlation with the $\gamma$ rays. However, a group of several $\gamma$-ray flares in April 2011 could be associated with the start of the 7 mm strong activity observed at the end of 2011.We also detected an increase in $R$-band polarization degree and rotation of the polarization angle simultaneous with these flares. Contemporaneous VLBI images at the same radio frequency show two new strong components close to the core, ejected in directions very different from that of the jet.The good correlation between radio and $R$-band variability suggests that their origin is synchrotron radiation. The lack of correlation with $\gamma$-rays produced by the Inverse Compton process on some occasions could be due to the lack of low energy photons in the jet direction or to absorption of the high energy photons by the broad line region clouds. The variability of the polarization parameters during flares can be easily explained by the combination of the jet polarization parameters and those of newly formed jet components.","Pedro P. B.

759,"Dwarf stars with debris discs and planets appear to be excellent laboratories to study the core accretion theory of planets formation. These systems are however, insufficiently studied. In this paper we present the main metallicity and lithium abundance properties of these stars together with stars with only debris discs and stars with only planets. Stars without detected planets nor discs are also considered. The analysed sample is formed by main-sequence FGK field single stars. Apart from the basic stellar parameters, we include the use of dusty discs masses. The main results show for the first time that the dust mass of debris disc stars with planets correlate with metallicity. We confirm that these disc dust masses are related to their central stellar masses. Separately, the masses of stars and those of planets also correlate with metallicity. We conclude that two conditions are necessary to form giant planets: to have a sufficient metallicity and also a sufficient protoplanetary mass of gas and dust. The debris discs masses of stars without giant planets do not correlate with metallicity, because they do not fulfil these two conditions. Concerning lithium, by adopting a stellar model for lithium depletion based on a strong interaction between the star and a protoplanetary disc, we found that in agreement with the model predictions, observations indicate that the main lithium depletion occurs during this initial protoplanetary evolution stage. We show that the ultimately lithium depletion is independent of the presence or absence of planets and appears to be only age dependent.","C. Chavero, R. de la Reza, L. Ghezzi, F.

761,"A significant fraction of stars between 7-11 solar masses are thought to become supernovae, but the explosion mechanism is unclear. The answer depends critically on the rate of electron capture on $^{20}$Ne in the degenerate oxygen-neon stellar core. However, due to the unknown strength of the transition between the ground states of $^{20}$Ne and $^{20}$F, it has not previously been possible to fully constrain the rate. By measuring the transition, we have established that its strength is exceptionally large and enhances the capture rate by several orders of magnitude. This has a decisive impact on the evolution of the core, increasing the likelihood that the star is (partially) disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion rather than collapsing to form a neutron star. Importantly, our measurement resolves the last remaining nuclear physics uncertainty in the final evolution of degenerate oxygen-neon stellar cores, allowing future studies to address the critical role of convection, which at present is poorly understood.","O.

762,"Though pairs of dynamically associated asteroids in the Main Belt have been identified and studied for over a decade, very few pair systems have been identified in the near-Earth asteroid population. We present data and analysis that supports the existence of two genetically related pairs in near-Earth space. The members of the individual systems, 2015 EE7 -- 2015 FP124 and 2017 SN16 -- 2018 RY7, are found to be of the same spectral taxonomic class, and both pairs are interpreted to have volatile-poor compositions. In conjunction with dynamical arguments, this suggests that these two systems formed via YORP spin-up and/or dissociation of a binary precursor. Backwards orbital integrations suggest a separation age of <10 kyr for the pair 2017 SN16 -- 2018 RY7, making these objects amongst the youngest multiple asteroid systems known to date. A unique separation age was not realized for 2015 EE7 -- 2015 FP124 due to large uncertainties associated with these objects' orbits. Determining the ages of such young pairs is of great value for testing models of space weathering and asteroid spin-state evolution.

763,"The nearby (50 pc) K7V dwarf HIP~41431 (EPIC 212096658) is a compact 3-tier hierarchy. Three K7V stars with similar masses, from 0.61 to 0.63 solar, make a triple-lined spectroscopic system where the inner binary with a period of 2.9 days is eclipsing, and the outer companion on a 59-day orbit exerts strong dynamical influence revealed by the eclipse time variation in the {\em Kepler} photometry. Moreover, the centre-of-mass of the triple system moves on a 3.9-year orbit, modulating the proper motion. The mass of the 4-th star is 0.35 solar. The Kepler and ground-based photometry and radial velocities from four different spectrographs are used to adjust the spectro-photodynamical model that accounts for dynamical interaction. The mutual inclination between the two inner orbits is 2\fdg16$\pm$0\fdg11, while the outer orbit is inclined to their common plane by 21\degr$\pm$16\degr. The inner orbit precesses under the influence of both outer orbits, causing observable variation of the eclipse depth. Moreover, the phase of the inner binary is strongly modulated with a 59-day period and its line of apsides precesses. The middle orbit with eccentricity $e=0.28$ also precesses, causing the observed variation of its radial velocity curve. Masses and other parameters of stars in this unique hierarchy are determined. This system is dynamically stable and likely old.","T. Borkovits, J. Sperauskas, A. Tokovinin, D. W. Latham, I. Csányi, T. Hajdu, L. Molnár","Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

764,"The ''radius valley"" is a relative dearth of planets between two potential populations of exoplanets, super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. This feature appears in examining the distribution of planetary radii, but has only ever been characterized on small samples. The valley could be a result of photoevaporation, which has been predicted in numerous theoretical models, or a result of other processes. Here, we investigate the relationship between planetary radius and orbital period through 2-dimensional kernel density estimator and various clustering methods, using all known super-Earths ($R<4.0R_E$). With our larger sample, we confirm the radius valley and characterize it as a power law. Using a variety of methods, we find a range of slopes that are consistent with each other and distinctly negative. We average over these results and find the slope to be $m=-0.319^{+0.088}_{-0.116}$. We repeat our analysis on samples from previous studies.

Methods: We use new spectroscopy obtained with the Hermes spectrograph to revisit the photometric binary solution of the two systems. The updated mass ratio and effective temperatures are incorporated to obtain new dynamical masses for the primary and secondary. With these, we perform isochrone-cloud based evolutionary modelling to investigate the core properties of these stars. Results: We report the first abundances for CW Cep and U Oph as well as report an updated dynamical solution for both systems. We find that we cannot uniquely constrain the amount of core boundary mixing in any of the stars we consider. Instead, we report their core masses and compare our results to previous studies. Conclusions: We find that the per-cent level precision on fundamental stellar quantities are accompanied with core mass estimates to between ~ 5-15%. We find that differences in analysis techniques can lead to substantially different evolutionary mode","C. Johnston, K. Pavlovski, A.

766,"The role of baroclinicity, which arises from the misalignment of pressure and density gradients, is well-known in the vorticity equation, yet its role in the kinetic energy budget has never been obvious. Here, we show that baroclinicity appears naturally in the kinetic energy budget after carrying out the appropriate scale decomposition. Strain generation by pressure and density gradients, both barotropic and baroclinic, also results from our analysis. These two processes underlie the recently identified mechanism of ""baropycnal work,"" which can transfer energy across scales in variable density flows. As such, baropycnal work is markedly distinct from pressure-dilatation into which the former is implicitly lumped in Large Eddy Simulations. We provide numerical evidence from 1,024^3 direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence. The data shows excellent pointwise agreement between baropycnal work and the nonlinear model we derive, supporting our interpretation of how it operates.","Aarne Lees, Hussein Aluie","28 pages, invited paper to special issue in ""Fluids""",1905.03581v2,No journal ref found,Hussein Aluie,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03581v2,2019-05-09 12:53:36+00:00,physics.flu-dyn,physics.flu-dyn|astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Baropycnal Work: A Mechanism for Energy Transfer Across Scales,2019-05-28 18:54:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03581v2
767,"We announce the discovery of KELT-23Ab, a hot Jupiter transiting the relatively bright ($V=10.3$) star BD+66 911 (TYC 4187-996-1), and characterize the system using follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. A global fit to the system yields host-star properties of $T_{eff}=5900\pm49 K$, $M_*=0.945^{+0.060}_{-0.054} M_{\odot}$, $R_*=0.995\pm0.015 R_{\odot}$, $L_*=1.082^{+0.051}_{-0.048} L_{\odot}$, log$g_{*}=4.418^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$ (cgs), and $\left[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}\right]=-0.105\pm0.077$. KELT-23Ab is a hot Jupiter with mass $M_P=0.938^{+0.045}_{-0.042} M_{\rm J}$, radius $R_P=1.322\pm0.025 R_{\rm J}$, and density $\rho_P=0.504^{+0.038}_{-0.035}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Intense insolation flux from the star has likely caused KELT-23Ab to become inflated.

There is strong evidence that KELT-23A is a member of a long-period binary star system with a less luminous companion, and due to tidal interactions, the planet is likely to spiral into its host within roughly a Gyr. This system has one of the highest positive ecliptic latitudes of all transiting planet hosts known to date, placing it near the Transiting Planet Survey Satellite and James Webb Space Telescope continuous viewing zones. Thus we expect it to be an excellent candidate for long-term monitoring and follow-up with these facilities.","Daniel Johns, Phillip Reed, Joseph Rodriguez, Joshua Pepper, Keivan Stassun, Kaloyan Penev, B.

Since only nine of more than 2000 known pulsars have accurately measured braking indices, it is of interest to extend this study to all known pulsars, in particular as regards GW generation. In summary, our results show a pessimistic prospect for the detection of GWs generated by these pulsars, even for advanced detectors such as aLIGO and AdVirgo, and the planned Einstein Telescope, would not be able to detect these pulsar, if the ellipticity has magnetic origin.","José C.

769,"We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), separating it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and (3) gas ejected from other galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range log(Mh/Msun) ~ 10-12 , and we focus on z=0.25 and z=2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ~L* halos retain a baryon mass >~50% of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by halos, with a retention fraction >~50%. Of the CGM mass, >~60% originates as IGM accretion at all masses and redshifts analyzed. Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ~L* halos. Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well mixed halo gas. Sight lines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple different origins. For low-redshift ~L* halos, cool gas (T<10^4.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by >~1 dex), although metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.","Z. Hafen, C. -A. Faucher-Giguere, D.

770,"Coalescing neutron star binary (NSB) systems are primary candidates for $r$-process enrichment of galaxies. The recent detection of $r$-process elements in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies and the abundances measured in classical dwarfs challenges the NSB merger scenario both in terms of coalescence time scales and merger locations. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of NSBs in the gravitational potentials of different types of host galaxies and on its impact on the subsequent galactic enrichment. We find that, even when receiving a low kick ($\sim 10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$) from the second supernova explosion, in shallow dwarf galaxy potentials NSBs tend to merge with a large off-set from the host galaxy. This results in a significant geometrical dilution of the amount of produced $r-$process elements that fall back and pollute the host galaxy gas reservoir. The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected $r$-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional $r$-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution.","Matteo Bonetti, Albino Perego, Massimo Dotti, Gabriele Cescutti","17 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1905.12016v1,No journal ref found,Gabriele Cescutti,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12016v1,2019-05-28 18:21:53+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.SR,Neutron star binary orbits in their host potential: effect on early   r-process enrichment,2019-05-28 18:21:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12016v1

We find that high solar wind dynamic pressures result in the topside ionosphere being depleted of plasma at all solar zenith angles, coincident with increased induced magnetic field strengths. The depletion of topside plasma in response to high solar wind dynamic pressures is observed in both weak and strong crustal magnetic field regions. Taken together, our results suggest that high solar wind dynamic pressures lead to ionospheric compression, increased ion escape, and reduced plasma production in the high-altitude nightside ionosphere.","Z.

772,"With a spin frequency of 707 Hz, PSR J0952-0607 is the second fastest spinning pulsar known. It was discovered in radio by LOFAR in 2017 at an estimated distance of either 0.97 or 1.74 kpc and has a low-mass companion with a 6.42 hr orbital period. We report discovery of the X-ray counterpart of PSR J0952-0607 using XMM-Newton. The X-ray spectra can be well-fit by a single power law model (Gamma = 2.5) or by a thermal plus power law model (kTeff = 40 eV and Gamma = 1.4). We do not detect evidence of variability, such as that due to orbital modulation. Because of its fast spin rate, PSR J0952-0607 is a crucial source for understanding the r-mode instability, which can be an effective mechanism for producing gravitational waves. Using the high end of our measured surface temperature, we infer a neutron star core temperature of ~10^7 K, which places PSR J0952-0607 within the window for the r-mode to be unstable unless an effect such as superfluid mutual friction damps the fluid oscillation.

773,"Identifying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through their X-ray emission is efficient, but necessarily biased against X-ray-faint objects. We aim to characterize this bias by comparing X-ray-selected AGNs to the ones identified through optical variability and mid-IR colours. We present a catalogue of AGNs selected through optical variability using all publicly available z-band Hubble Space Telescope images in the GOODS-South field. For all objects in the catalogue, we compute X-ray upper limits or discuss detections in the deepest available 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field South images and present the Spitzer/IRAC mid-IR colours. For the variability study, we consider only sources observed over at least five epochs and over a time baseline of up to ten years. We adopt the elevated median absolute deviation as a variability indicator robust against individual outlier measurements and identify 113 variability-selected AGN candidates. Among these, 26 have an X-ray counterpart and lie within the conventional AGN area in the FX/Fopt diagram. The candidates with X-ray upper limits are on average optically fainter, have higher redshifts compared to the X-ray detected ones and are consistent with low luminosity AGNs. Out of 41 variable optical sources with IR detections, 13 fulfill the IR AGN colour selection criteria.

774,"We report the serendipitous detection of two 3 mm continuum sources found in deep ALMA Band 3 observations to study intermediate redshift galaxies in the COSMOS field. One is near a foreground galaxy at 1.3"", but is a previously unknown dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at probable $z_{CO}=3.329$, illustrating the risk of misidentifying shorter wavelength counterparts. The optical-to-mm spectral energy distribution (SED) favors a grey $\lambda^{-0.4}$ attenuation curve and results in significantly larger stellar mass and SFR compared to a Calzetti starburst law, suggesting caution when relating progenitors and descendants based on these quantities. The other source is missing from all previous optical/near-infrared/sub-mm/radio catalogs (""ALMA-only""), and remains undetected even in stacked ultradeep optical ($>29.6$ AB) and near-infrared ($>27.9$ AB) images. Using the ALMA position as a prior reveals faint $SNR\sim3$ measurements in stacked IRAC 3.6+4.5, ultradeep SCUBA2 850$\mu$m, and VLA 3GHz, indicating the source is real. The SED is robustly reproduced by a massive $M^*=10^{10.8}$M$_\odot$ and $M_{gas}=10^{11}$M$_\odot$, highly obscured $A_V\sim4$, star forming $SFR\sim300$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy at redshift $z=5.5\pm$1.1. The ultrasmall 8 arcmin$^{2}$ survey area implies a large yet uncertain contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density CSFRD(z=5) $\sim0.9\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, comparable to all ultraviolet-selected galaxies combined. These results indicate the existence of a prominent population of DSFGs at $z>4$, below the typical detection limit of bright galaxies found in single-dish sub-mm surveys, but with larger space densities $\sim3 \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, higher duty cycles $50-100\%$, contributing more to the CSFRD, and potentially dominating the high-mass galaxy stellar mass function.","Christina C.

776,"Astrophysical explosions are accompanied by the propagation of a shock wave through an ambient medium. Depending on the mass and energy involved in the explosion, the shock velocity $V$ can be non-relativistic ($V \ll c$, where $c$ is the speed of light), ultra-relativistic ($V \simeq c$), or moderately relativistic ($V \sim few\times 0.1c$). While self-similar, energy-conserving solutions to the fluid equations that describe the shock propagation are known in the non-relativistic (the Sedov-Taylor blastwave) and ultra-relativistic (the Blandford-McKee blastwave) regimes, the finite speed of light violates scale invariance and self-similarity when the flow is only mildly relativistic. By treating relativistic terms as perturbations to the fluid equations, here we derive the $\mathcal{O}(V^2/c^2)$, energy-conserving corrections to the non-relativistic, Sedov-Taylor solution for the propagation of a strong shock. We show that relativistic terms modify the post-shock fluid velocity, density, pressure, and the shock speed itself, the latter being constrained by global energy conservation. We derive these corrections for a range of post-shock adiabatic indices $\gamma$ (which we set as a fixed number for the post-shock gas) and ambient power-law indices $n$, where the density of the ambient medium $\rho_{\rm a}$ into which the shock advances declines with spherical radius $r$ as $\rho_{\rm a} \propto r^{-n}$. For Sedov-Taylor blastwaves that terminate in a contact discontinuity with diverging density, we find that there is no relativistic correction to the Sedov-Taylor solution that simultaneously satisfies the fluid equations and conserves energy. These solutions have implications for relativistic supernovae, the transition from ultra- to sub-relativistic velocities in gamma-ray bursts, and other high-energy phenomena.",Eric R.

777,"Fermi-LAT observations have strongly constrained dark matter annihilation through the joint-likelihood analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). These constraints are expected to be robust because dSphs have measurable dark matter content and produce negligible astrophysical emission. However, each dSph is dim, with a predicted flux that typically falls below the accuracy of the background model. We show that this significantly diminishes the reliability of previous joint-likelihood algorithms, and develop an improved analysis that directly accounts for the effect of background mismodeling. This method produces more robust limits and detections of dark matter in both real and mock data.

The reliability of bubble identifications, as assessed by comparison to visual identifications by trained experts and scoring by a machine-learning algorithm, is found to be a significant improvement over DR1. We assess the reliability of IR bow shocks via comparison to expert identifications and the colours of candidate bow-shock driving stars in the 2MASS point-source catalogue.

The presence of two fluids induces corrections to the Lagrangian bias expansion and tracer advection, both of which we formulate as expansions in the three linear modes of the Lagrangian equations of motion. We compute the linear-order two-fluid corrections in the Zeldovich approximation, finding that modifications to the bias expansion and tracer advection both enter as percent-level corrections over a large range of wavenumbers at low redshift and draw parallels with the Eulerian formalism. We then discuss nonlinear corrections in the two-fluid picture, and calculate contributions from the relative velocity effect ($\propto v_r^2$) at one loop order. Finally, we conduct an exploratory Fisher analysis to assess the impact of two-fluid corrections on baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements, finding that while modest values of the relative bias parameters can introduce systematic biases in the measured BAO scale of up to $0.5\, \sigma$, fitting for these effects as additional parameters increases the error bar by less than $30\%$ across a wide range of bias values.","Shi-Fan Chen, Emanuele Castorina, Martin White","31 pages, 11 figures.

780,"Since crossing the heliopause on August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 observed reductions in galactic cosmic ray count rates caused by a time-varying depletion of particles with pitch angles near 90-deg, while intensities of particles with other pitch angles remain unchanged.

We characterize the anisotropy as a ""notch"" in an otherwise uniform pitch-angle distribution of varying depth and width centered about 90 degrees in pitch angle space. The notch averages 22-deg wide and 15% deep - signifying a depletion region that is broad and shallow.

782,"The nature of the post-merger remnant of the first binary neutron star coalescence observed by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) and Advanced Virgo, GW170817, is unknown. Searches have been carried out for short ($\lesssim 1$ s), intermediate ($\lesssim 500$ s), and long ($\sim$ days) signals using various algorithms without yielding a detection. We describe an efficient frequency tracking scheme based on a hidden Markov model to search for long-duration transient signals from a neutron star remnant with spin-down time-scale in the range $\sim 10^2$s-$10^4$s. It was one of the methods used in the search for signals from a long-lived remnant of GW170817. We validate the method and estimate its sensitivity through Monte-Carlo simulations on the same data set as used in the GW170817 search. We describe the search configuration, procedure, and follow-up step by step. The methodology of the hidden Markov model is described fully to ensure that future analyses of this kind can be reproduced by an independent party.","Ling Sun, Andrew Melatos",No comment found,1810.03577v2,No journal ref found,Andrew Melatos,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03577v2,2018-10-08 16:54:35+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM,Application of hidden Markov model tracking to the search for   long-duration transient gravitational waves from the remnant of the binary   neutron star merger GW170817,2019-05-28 17:49:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03577v2
783,"We present a method for deriving the electron density of ionized gas using the ratio of the intensity of the [NII] 205um line to that of Hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRL). We use this method to derive electron densities of 21 velocity components in 11 lines of sight through the Galaxy, including the Galactic center. We observed, at high--spectral resolution, the [NII] 205um line with the Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT instruments and the radio recombination lines with the Green Bank Telescope and the NASA Deep Space Network Deep Space Station 43 (DSS--43) telescope. We find typical electron densities between 6 to 170 cm^-3, which are consistent with those derived at low spectral resolution using the [NII] 205um/122um line ratio with Herschel/PACS on a larger sample of sight lines in the Galactic plane. By matching the electron densities derived from the [NII] 205um/RRL intensity ratio and the [NII] 122um/205um intensity ratio, we derive the nitrogen fractional abundance for most of the velocity components. We investigate the dependence of the N/H ratio with Galactocentric distance in the inner Galaxy (R_gal<6 kpc, which is inaccessible in optical studies due to dust extinction. We find that the distribution of nitrogen abundances in the inner galaxy derived from our data has a slope that is consistent to that found in the outer Galaxy in optical studies. This result is inconsistent with some suggestions of a flatter distribution of the nitrogen abundance in the inner galaxy.","Jorge L. Pineda, Shinji Horiuchi, L. D. Anderson, Matteo Luisi, Paul F.

784,"The expansion history of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation-domination (RD) is currently unknown. If the equation of state during this period is stiffer than that of radiation, $w > 1/3$, the gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation acquires a blue-tilt ${d\log\rho_{\rm GW}\over d\log f} = {2(w-1/3)\over (w+1/3)} > 0$ at frequencies $f \gg f_{\rm RD}$ corresponding to modes re-entering the horizon during the stiff-domination (SD), where $f_{\rm RD}$ is the frequency today of the horizon scale at the SD-to-RD transition. We characterized in detail the transfer function of the GW energy density spectrum, considering both 'instant' and smooth modelings of the SD-to-RD transition. The shape of the spectrum is controlled by $w$, $f_{\rm RD}$, and $H_{\rm inf}$ (the Hubble scale of inflation). We determined the parameter space compatible with a detection of this signal by LIGO and LISA, including possible changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and the presence of a tensor tilt. Consistency with upper bounds on stochastic GW backgrounds, however, rules out a significant fraction of the observable parameter space. We find that this renders the signal unobservable by Advanced LIGO, in all cases. The GW background remains detectable by LISA, though only in a small island of parameter space, corresponding to scenarios with an equation of state in the range $0.46 \lesssim w \lesssim 0.56$ and a high inflationary scale $H_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$, but low reheating temperature $1~{\rm MeV} \lesssim T_{\rm RD} \lesssim 150~{\rm MeV}$ (equivalently, $10^{-11}~{\rm Hz} \lesssim f_{\rm RD} \lesssim 3.6\cdot10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$).

Trapped into the deconfined phase, the universe could inflate and cool down till the temperature reaches the QCD strong scale. We show how at these low temperatures QCD effects are important and could trigger the exit from the long supercooling era. We also study the implications on relic abundances. In particular, the latent heat released at the end of supercooling could be the reason for the similarities between dark matter and baryon energy densities. The axion abundance could also be significantly affected, allowing for larger values of the axion decay constant. Finally, we discuss how a long supercooling epoch could lead to an enhanced gravitational wave signal.","Pietro Baratella, Alex Pomarol, Fabrizio Rompineve","24 + 7 pages, 8 figures. v2: references added",1812.06996v2,No journal ref found,Fabrizio Rompineve,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06996v2,2018-12-17 19:00:19+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,The Supercooled Universe,2019-05-28 17:08:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06996v2

Our high sensitivity and high resolution ($\sim 100$ au) observations show a clear hourglass magnetic field morphology centered on the protostellar system, but the central pattern is consistent with a toroidal field indicative of a circumstellar disk, although other interpretations are also possible, including field lines dragged by an equatorial accretion flow into a configuration parallel to the midplane. If a relatively large disk does exist, it would suggest that the magnetic braking catastrophe is averted in this system, not through a large misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes, but rather through some other mechanisms, such as non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects and/or turbulence. We have also found a relationship of decreasing polarization fractions with intensities and the various slopes of this relationship can be understood as multiple polarization mechanisms and/or depolarization from a changing field morphology. In addition, we found a prominent clumpy depolarization strip crossing the center perpendicular to the bipolar outflow. Moreover, a rough estimate of the magnetic field strength indicates that the field is strong enough to hinder formation of a rotationally supported disk, which is inconsistent with the feature of a central toroidal field.","Woojin Kwon, Ian Stephens, John Tobin, Leslie Looney, Zhi-Yun Li, Floris van der Tak, Richard Crutcher","14 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ",1805.07348v2,No journal ref found,Richard Crutcher,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07348v2,2018-05-18 17:57:56+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.GA,Highly Ordered and Pinched Magnetic Fields in the Class 0 Proto-Binary   System L1448 IRS 2,2019-05-28 16:38:22+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07348v2
788,"Very metal-poor halo stars are the best candidates for being among the oldest objects in our Galaxy. Samples of halo stars with age determination and detailed chemical composition measurements provide key information for constraining the nature of the first stellar generations and the nucleosynthesis in the metal-poor regime.} Age estimates are very uncertain and are available for only a small number of metal-poor stars. Here we present the first results of a pilot program aimed at deriving precise masses, ages and chemical abundances for metal-poor halo giants using asteroseismology, and high-resolution spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution UVES spectra for four metal-poor RAVE stars observed by the K2 satellite. Seismic data obtained from K2 light curves helped improving spectroscopic temperatures, metallicities and individual chemical abundances. Mass and ages were derived using the code PARAM, investigating the effects of different assumptions (e.g. mass loss, [alpha/Fe]-enhancement). Orbits were computed using Gaia DR2 data. {The stars are found to be ""normal"" metal-poor halo stars (i.e. non C-enhanced), with an abundance pattern typical of old stars (i.e. alpha and Eu-enhanced), and with masses in the 0.80-1.0 M_sun range. The inferred model-dependent stellar ages are found to range from 7.4 to 13.0 Gyr, with uncertainties of ~ 30%-35%. We also provide revised masses and ages for metal-poor stars with Kepler seismic data from APOGEE survey and a set of M4 stars. {The present work shows that the combination of asteroseismology and high-resolution spectroscopy provides precise ages in the metal-poor regime.

789,"T Tauri stars are low-mass young stars whose disks provide the setting for planet formation. Despite this, their structure is poorly understood. We present new infrared interferometric observations of the SU Aurigae circumstellar environment that offer 3 x higher resolution and better baseline position angle coverage over previous observations. We investigate the characteristics of circumstellar material around SU Aur, constrain the disk geometry, composition and inner dust rim structure. The CHARA array offers opportunities for long baseline observations, with baselines up to 331 m. Using the CLIMB 3-telescope combiner in the K-band allows us to measure visibilities as well as closure phase. We undertook image reconstruction for model-independent analysis, and geometric modeling. Additionally, the fitting of radiative transfer models constrains the physical parameters of the disk. For the first time, a dusty disk wind is introduced to the radiative transfer code TORUS to model protoplanetary disks. Our implementation is motivated by theoretical dusty disk winds, where magnetic field lines drive dust above the disk plane close to the sublimation zone. Image reconstruction reveals an inclined disk with slight asymmetry along its minor-axis, likely due to inclination effects obscuring the inner disk rim through absorption of incident star light on the near-side and thermal re-emission/scattering of the far-side. Geometric modelling of a skewed ring finds the inner rim at 0.17+/-0.02 au with an inclination of 50.9+/-1.0 degrees and minor axis position angle 60.8+/-1.2 degrees. Radiative transfer modelling shows a flared disk with an inner radius at 0.18 au which implies a grain size of 0.4 um and a scale height of 15.0 au at 100 au. Among the tested radiative transfer models, only the dusty disk wind successfully accounts for the K-band excess by introducing dust above the mid-plane.","Aaron Labdon, Stefan Kraus, Claire L Davies, Alexander Kreplin, Jacques Kluska, Tim J Harries, John D Monnier, Theo ten Brummelaar, Fabian Baron, Rafael Millan-Gabet, Brian Kloppenborg, Joshua Eisner, Judit Sturmann, Laszlo Sturmann",Accepted for publication in Astronomy \& Astrophysics,1905.11907v1,No journal ref found,Laszlo Sturmann,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11907v1,2019-05-28 16:10:39+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,"Dusty disk winds at the sublimation rim of the highly inclined, low mass   YSO SU Aurigae",2019-05-28 16:10:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11907v1
790,"The envelope of the red supergiant VY CMa has long been considered an extreme example of episodic mass loss that is possibly taking place in other cool and massive evolved stars. Recent submm observations of the envelope revealed massive dusty clumps within 800 mas from the star which reinforce the picture of drastic mass-loss phenomena in VY CMa. We present new ALMA observations at an angular resolution of 0.1"" and at an unprecedented sensitivity that reveal further details about the dusty clumps. We resolve more discrete features and identify a submm counterpart of a more distant Clump SW known from visual observations. The brightest clump, named C, is resolved in the observations. Gas seen against the resolved continuum emission of clump C produces a molecular spectrum in absorption. Except for SW Clump, no molecular emission is found to be associated with the dusty clumps and we propose that the dusty structures have an atypically low gas content. We attempt to reproduce the properties of the dusty clumps through three-dimensional radiative-transfer modeling. Although a clump configuration explaining the observations is found, it is not unique. A very high optical depth of all clumps to the stellar radiation make the modeling very challenging and requires unrealistically high dust masses. It is suggested that the dusty features have substructures, e.g. porosity, that allows deeper penetration of stellar photons within the clumps than in a homogeneous configuration. A comparison of the estimated clumps ages to variations in the stellar visual flux for over a century suggests that the mechanism responsible for their formation is not uniquely manifested by enhanced or strongly diminished visual light. The study demonstrates that the dusty mass-loss episodes of VY CMa are indeed unparalleled among all known non-explosive stars. The origin of these episodes remains an unsolved problem.",Tomek Kaminski,accepted to A&A,1903.09558v2,No journal ref found,Tomek Kaminski,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09558v2,2019-03-22 15:31:30+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.GA,On massive dust clumps in the envelope of the red supergiant VY Canis   Majoris,2019-05-28 16:08:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09558v2
791,"We performed deep spectropolarimetric observations of a prototypical starburst galaxy M82 with the Subaru Telescope in order to study the kinematics of the dust outflow. We obtained optical polarized emission-line spectra up to $\sim$4~kpc away from the nucleus of the galaxy along three position angles within the conical outflowing wind (superwind). The H$\alpha$ emission line in the superwind is strongly polarized and the polarization pattern shows dust scattering of central light sources, being consistent with the previous works. The intensity weighted polarization degree of the H$\alpha$ line reaches $\sim$30\%\ at maximum. There are at least two light sources at the central region of the galaxy; one of which is located at the near-infrared nucleus and the other resides at one of the peaks of the 3 mm radio and molecular gas emission. The outer (> 1 kpc) dust is illuminated by the former, whereas the inner dust is scattering the light from the latter. We investigated as well the dust motion from the velocity field of the polarized H$\alpha$ emission line. The dust is accelerated outward on the northwest side of the nucleus. A simple bi-conical dust outflow model shows that the outflow velocity of the dust reaches $\gtrsim 300-450$ km/s at $\sim 4$ kpc from the nucleus, suggesting that some portion of the dust escapes from the gravitational potential of M82 into the intergalactic space. At some regions on the southeast side, in particular along the position angle of 138$^\circ$, the dust has radial velocity slower than the systemic velocity of the galaxy, apparently suggesting inflowing motion toward the nucleus. These components are spatially consistent with a part of the molecular gas stream, which is kinematically independent of the outflow gas, thus the apparent inflow motion of the dust reflects the streaming motion associated with the molecular gas stream.","Michitoshi Yoshida, Koji S.

792,"In the CDM paradigm, the halo mass function is a sensitive probe of the cosmic structure. In observations, halo mass is typically estimated from its relation with other observables. The resulting halo mass function is subject to systematic bias, such as the Eddington bias, due to the scatter or uncertainty in the observable - mass relation. Exact correction for the bias is not easy, as predictions for the observables are typically model-dependent in simulations. In this paper, we point out an interesting feature in the halo mass function of the concordence $\Lambda$CDM model: the total halo mass within each evenly-spaced logarithmic mass bin is approximately the same over a large mass range. We show that this property allows us to construct an almost bias-free halo mass function using only an observable (as a halo mass estimator) and stacked weak lensing measurements as long as the scatter between the true halo mass and the observable-inferred mass has a stable form in logarithmic units. The method is not sensitive to the form of the mass-observable relation. We test the idea using cosmological simulations, and show that the method performs very well for realistic observables.","Fuyu Dong, Jun Zhang, Xiaohu Yang, Jiajun Zhang, Wentao Luo","10 pages,16 figures",1905.11886v1,No journal ref found,Wentao Luo,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11886v1,2019-05-28 15:29:12+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Towards a Model-Independent Measurement of the Halo Mass Function with   Observables,2019-05-28 15:29:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11886v1

Using the photometric data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) for the Galactic bulge, we searched for binary candidates among non-modulated fundamental-mode RR~Lyrae variables. We constructed and investigated over 9000 $O-C$ diagrams for individual pulsators, in order to find signs of the light-travel time effect. We found 20 variables exhibiting cyclic variation in the $O-C$ (time of the observed minus calculated brightness maximum) diagram, which can be associated with a second component in the system, but for confirmation of binarity, a long-term radial velocity study is necessary. The modeling of the $O-C$ diagrams yields orbital parameters, estimates of the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, and the mass function. The orbital periods of our candidates range from 3 to 15 years. Two of the binary candidates display a minimum mass higher than the assumed mass of the RR~Lyrae component, which points towards an evolved companion that can under some circumstances contribute significantly to the total light of the system.","Z.

We determined fully phase-coherent timing solutions through the first two glitches, giving us high confidence in their detection, while the third candidate glitch is somewhat less secure. These are larger in magnitude (and opposite in sign) than any known radio pulsar glitch. This may be caused by the prolonged rapid spin-up of the pulsar causing a sudden transfer of angular momentum between the superfluid and non-superfluid components of the star.

795,"The sources of cosmic rays with energies above 55 EeV are still mysterious. A guaranteed associated flux of ultra high energy neutrinos known as the cosmogenic neutrino flux will be measured by next generation radio facilities, such as the proposed Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND). By using the orthogonal information provided by the cosmogenic neutrino flux, we here determine the prospects of GRAND to constrain the source redshift evolution and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray sources. If the redshift evolution is known, independently on GRAND's energy resolution, GRAND with 200,000 antennas will constrain the proton/iron fraction to the $\sim5-10\%$ level after one year of data taking; on the other hand, if hints on the average source composition are given, GRAND will measure the redshift evolution of the sources to a $\sim 10\%$ uncertainty. However, the foreseen configuration of GRAND alone will not be able to break the degeneracy between redshift evolution of the sources and their composition.

A 6D kinematical and spatial solution was obtained for 429 RR~Lyrae stars. We use a model of the Galactic gravitational potential to infer stellar orbits. We did not find a difference between the Oosterhoff groups in the individual components of the space velocity. We report that \textit{foreground} and \textit{background} stars with respect to the Galactic bulge stand out in the mean $V$ velocity component, which we interpret as a sign of the Galactic rotation. The movement of the studied stars in the central region of the Galactic bulge is consistent with random motions expected for a classical bulge component. From the orbital integration, we estimate that 8\,\% of the RR~Lyrae stars are halo interlopers currently located in the Galactic bulge. The majority of the stars' orbits are within a 3\,kpc radius from the Galactic bulge. The fraction of Oosterhoff\,II stars increases with increasing Galactic latitude, as well as towards longer orbital periods. We found several RR~Lyrae stars with high space velocities, one of which has an extremely long orbital period of $\sim$1\,Gyr. We conclude that based on their kinematics, the vast majority of the stars in our sample do not seem to contribute to the boxy/peanut component of the Galactic bulge.","Z. Prudil, I. Dékány, E. K.

797,"In Paper I (Safarzadeh & Berger 2019) we studied the determination of the delay time distribution (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) through scaling relations between halo/stellar mass and the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies hosting gravitational wave (GW) events in the local universe. Here we explore how a detailed reconstruction of the individual SFHs of BNS merger host galaxies can improve on the use of the scaling relations. We use galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, which is mass complete at $M_*>10^9$ M$_\odot$ in the redshift range $0.05<z<0.08$. We use the reconstructed SFHs derived from the Prospector code, for two distinct sets of priors (favoring continuous and bursty SFHs), and convolve those with power law DTDs characterized by an index $\Gamma$ and a minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}$. We find that with this approach $\mathcal{O}(100)-\mathcal{O}(300)$ host galaxies are required to constrain the DTD parameters, with the number depending on the choice of SFH prior and on the parameters of the true DTD. We further show that using only the host galaxies of BNS mergers, as opposed to the full population of potential host galaxies in the relevant cosmic volume, leads to a minor bias in the recovered DTD parameters. The required host galaxy sample size is nearly an order of magnitude smaller relative to the approach of using scaling relations, and we expect such a host galaxy sample to be collected within a decade or two, prior to the advent of third-generation GW detectors.","Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Edo Berger, Joel Leja, Joshua S.

798,"In the past, laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations showed a mismatch in derived sticking properties of silicates in the context of planetesimal formation. It has been proposed by Kimura et al. (2015) that this mismatch is due to the value of the surface energy assumed, supposedly correlated to the presence or lack of water layers of different thickness on a grain's surface. We present tensile strength measurements of dust aggregates with different water content here. The results are in support of the suggestion by Kimura et al. (2015). Dry samples show increased strengths by a factor of up to 10 over wet samples. A high value of $\gamma = 0.2 J/m^2$ likely applies to the dry low pressure conditions of protoplanetary disks and should be used in the future.","Tobias Steinpilz, Jens Teiser, Gerhard Wurm",No comment found,1905.11864v1,No journal ref found,Gerhard Wurm,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11864v1,2019-05-28 14:54:21+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Sticking Properties of Silicates in Planetesimal Formation Revisited,2019-05-28 14:54:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11864v1

800,"Neutron star mergers (NM) are a plausible source of heavy r-process elements such as Europium, but previous chemical evolution models have either failed to reproduce the observed Europium trends for Milky Way thick disc stars (with [Fe/H] ~ -1) or have done so only by adopting unrealistically short merger timescales. Using analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that models with a single-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and metallicity-independent yields cannot reproduce observations showing [Eu/alpha] > 0 or [Eu/Fe] > [alpha/Fe] for alpha-elements such as Mg and Si. However, this problem is easily resolved if we allow for a 2-phase ISM, with hot-phase cooling times \tau_{cool} of order 1 Gyr and a larger fraction of NM yields injected directly into the cold star-forming phase relative to alpha-element yields from core collapse supernovae (ccSNe). We find good agreement with observations in models with a cold phase injection ratio f_{c,NM}/f_{c,ccSN} of order 2, and a characteristic merger timescale \tau_NM=150 Myr. We show that the observed super-solar [Eu/alpha] at intermediate metallicities implies that a significant fraction of Eu originates from NM or another source besides ccSNe, and that these non-ccSN yields are preferentially deposited in the star-forming phase of the ISM at early times.","Ralph Schönrich, David H.

802,"India and Belgium have jointly established two 4 meter class optical telescopes at Devasthal located in Nainital, India. After successful installation of the 3.6-m modern new technology Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) in 2015, it was technically activated by premiers of both countries from Brussels on March 30, 2016. Since then, the 3.6-m DOT has been used for both optical and near-Infrared (NIR) observations for a number of research proposals. The best angular resolution achieved is 0\farcsec4 indicating that the optics of the 3.6-m DOT is good and capable of providing images of the celestial bodies with sub-arc-second resolution. The observations provide proof that the care taken in the construction of the telescope dome building has paid a rich dividend as their thermal mass is so low that it has not degraded the natural atmospheric seeing at Devasthal measured about two decades ago during 1997 to 1999 using differential image motion monitor.   A few preliminary scientific results obtained from recent observations are presented along with performance and global potential of the 3.6-m DOT in the field of galactic astronomy. The 3.6-m DOT is capable of providing internationally competitive science once high resolution spectrograph and other planned modern back-end instruments become operational.

Despite that the issue might seem like a trivial one, some confusion might arise when dealing with higher-derivatives Horndeski theories that at first sight do not look like scalar-tensor theories. To further complicate things, the discussion on the physical equivalence of the different conformal frames in which a given scalar-tensor theory may be formulated, makes even harder to achieve a correct classification.","Israel Quiros, Francisco Antonio Horta-Rangel, Roberto De Arcia, Ismael Delgado Gaspar, Ricardo García-Salcedo, Tame Gonzalez","27 pages, no figures.

804,"Recently a class of inflationary models satisfying the constant rate of roll constraint, $\ddot{\phi}+(3+\alpha)H\dot{\phi}=0$, has been studied and compared with the latest cosmological observational data. We consider the broader class of constraints $ \ddot{\phi}+\frac{\alpha_1}{2}\dot{\phi}+\alpha_2 H\dot{\phi}=0$ and find an exact particular solution, without initial singularity, which is an attractor of the dynamics governed by a positive periodic potential $V(\phi)=E+ F \cos (\Omega \phi )+G \cos (2 \Omega \phi )$. The spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with the recent observational data. If we assume that reheating and creation of matter after the end of inflation do not affect significantly the qualitative properties of the solutions of the equations of motion, we find that this particular solution can describe a period of deceleration and a second period of acceleration, consistent with the experimental results. In addition it yields the current value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the value of the redshift for the beginning of the second phase of accelerated expansion in agreement with current data. Indeed our results indicate that reheating and creation of matter will be most relevant for {\em other} aspects of cosmology than these parameters, otherwise it would have been impossible to satisfy the constraints they impose, within this family of models.","B.

Our sample extends our previous study, which compared a Planck detected cold cloud in the outskirts of the LMC with the 30 Doradus molecular cloud and found the typical line width for 1 pc radius structures to be 5 times larger in 30 Doradus. By observing clouds with intermediate levels of star formation activity, we demonstrate a clear correlation between line width at fixed size and both local and cloud-scale 8${\mu}$m intensity. At the same time, line width at a given size appears to independently correlate with measures of mass surface density.

806,"PS15dpn is a luminous rapidly rising Type Ibn supernova (SN) discovered by Pan-STARRS1 (PS1). Previous study shown that the bolometric light curve (LC) cannot be explained by the $^{56}$Ni cascade decay model. In this paper, we employ some alternative models, i.e., the magnetar model, and the $^{56}$Ni plus magnetar model, the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) model (the CSI model), and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model, to fit the bolometric LC of PS15dpn. We found that all these models can reproduce the theoretical LCs matching the data. By analyzing the parameters of these models and combining with the spectral features, we conclude that the $^{56}$Ni plus CSI model involving an eruptive shell expelled by the SN progenitor are the most promising one in explaining the LC of PS15dpn. In this scenario, the masses of the ejecta, the CSM, and the $^{56}$Ni are $13.01_{-4.88}^{+4.09}$\,M$_\odot$, $0.79_{-0.07}^{+0.07}$\,M$_\odot$, and $0.35_{-0.11}^{+0.08}$\,M$_\odot$, respectively. These parameters are consistent with the conjecture that the progenitors of SNe Ibn are massive Wolf-Rayet stars. Furthermore, our results indicate that the progenitor of PS15dpn might expelled a gas shell $\sim$ 10--230 days prior to the SN explosion.","Shan-Qin Wang, Long Li","8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to ApJ",1905.12623v1,No journal ref found,Long Li,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12623v1,2019-05-28 13:58:00+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Exploring the Energy Sources Powering the Light Curve of the Type Ibn   Supernova PS15dpn and the Mass-Loss History of the SN Progenitor,2019-05-28 13:58:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12623v1
807,"The importance of studying the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point by external means was underlined by Lindegren et al. (2018), and initiated by several works making use of Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and asteroseismology. Despite a very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about 500 and 700 red giants (both RGB and RC) selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging into a thorough comparison of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point, in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third Data Release of Gaia.","Saniya Khan, Andrea Miglio, Benoît Mosser, Frédéric Arenou, Kévin Belkacem, Anthony G.

808,"Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) originating from innermost regions of blazars can provide unique perspective of some of the burning issues in blazar studies including disk-jet connection, launch of relativistic jets from the central engine, and other extreme conditions near the fast rotating supermassive black holes. However, a number of hurdles associated with searching QPOs in blazars e.g., red-noise dominance, modest significance of the detection and periodic modulation lasting for only a couple of cycles, make it difficult to estimate the true significance of the detection. In this work, we report a $\sim$ 330-day QPO in the Fermi/LAT observations of the blazar Mrk 501 spanning nearly a decade. To establish consistency of the result, we adopted multiple approaches to the time series analysis and employed four widely known methods. Among these, Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform represent frequency domain based methods whereas epoch folding and z-transformed discrete auto-correlation function are time-domain based analysis. Power spectrum response method was followed to properly account for the red-noise, largely inherent in blazar light curves. Both local and global significance of the signal were found to be above 99\% over possible spurious detection. In the context where not many $\gamma$-ray QPOs have been reported to last more than 5 cycles, this might be one of the few instances where we witness a sub-year timescale $\gamma$-ray QPO persisting nearly 7 cycles.

809,"Massive $10^{4-5}\rm\ M_{\odot}$ black hole seeds resulting from the \textit{direct} collapse of pristine gas require a metal-free atomic cooling halo with extremely low H$_2$ fraction, allowing the gas to cool isothermally in the presence of atomic hydrogen. In order to achieve this chemo-thermodynamical state, the gas needs to be irradiated by both: Lyman-Werner (LW) photons in the energy range $11.2-13.6$ eV capable of photodissociating H$_2$, and $0.76$ eV photons capable of photodetaching H$^-$. Employing cosmological simulations capable of creating the first galaxies in high resolution, we explore if there exists a subset that favours DCBH formation in their vicinity. We find a fundamental relation between the maximum distance at which a galaxy can cause DCBH formation and its star formation rate (SFR), which automatically folds in the chemo-thermodynamical effects of both H$_2$ photo-dissociation and H$^-$ photo-detachment. This is in contrast to the scatter in the LW flux parameter seen at the maximum distance. It shows up to a 3 order of magnitude scatter, which can be interpreted as a scatter in `J$_{crit}$'. Thus, computing the rates and/or the LW flux from a galaxy is no longer necessary to identify neighbouring sites of DCBH formation, as our relation allows one to distinguish regions where DCBH formation could be triggered in the vicinity of a galaxy of a given SFR.","Bhaskar Agarwal, Fergus Cullen, Sadegh Khochfar, Daniel Ceverino, Ralf S.

810,"Several extremely metal-poor stars are known to have an enhanced thorium abundance. These actinide-boost stars have likely inherited material from an r-process that operated under different conditions than the most frequent r-process in the galaxy. In this article, we explore the sensitivity of actinide production in r-process calculations on the hydrodynamical conditions as well as on the nuclear physics. We find that the initial electron fraction Ye is the most important factor determining the actinide yields and that the abundance ratios between long-lived actinides and lanthanides like europium can vary for different conditions in our calculations. In our setup, conditions with high entropies systematically lead to lower actinide abundances relative to other r-process elements. Furthermore, actinide-enhanced ejecta can be distinguished from the ""regular"" composition also in other ways, most notably in the second r-process peak abundances.","Marius Eichler, Wida Sayar, Almudena Arcones, Thomas Rauscher","20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ApJ",1904.07013v2,No journal ref found,Thomas Rauscher,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07013v2,2019-04-15 13:03:50+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Probing the production of actinides under different r-process conditions,2019-05-28 12:23:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07013v2
811,"Blueshifted absorption lines are seen in high inclination black hole binary systems in their disc dominated states, showing these power an equatorial disc wind. While some contribution from magnetic winds remain a possibility, thermal and thermal-radiative winds are expected to be present. We show results from radiation hydrodynamic simulations which show that the additional radiation force from atomic features (bound-free and lines) are important along with electron scattering. Together, these increase the wind velocity at high inclinations, so that they quantitatively match the observations in H 1743-322, unlike purely thermal winds which are too slow. We highlight the role played by shadowing of the outer disc from the (sub grid) inner disc Compton heated layer, and show that the increase in shadow from the higher Compton temperature after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of the wind. Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and their disappearance) in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only a minor role. We speculate that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the spectral features seen in the more complex (larger disc size) binaries, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, without requiring magnetic winds.","Ryota Tomaru, Chris Done, Ken Ohsuga, Mariko Nomura, Tadayuki Takahashi","11 pages, 12 figures",1905.11763v1,No journal ref found,Tadayuki Takahashi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11763v1,2019-05-28 12:15:10+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,The thermal-radiative wind in low mass X-ray binary H 1743-322;   Radiation hydrodynamic simulations,2019-05-28 12:15:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11763v1
812,"The distribution of dark matter (DM) subhalos in our Galaxy remains disputed, leading to varying $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ flux predictions from their annihilation or decay. In this work, we study how, in the inner Galaxy, subhalo tidal disruption from the Galactic baryonic potential impacts these signals. Based on state-of-the art modeling of this effect from numerical simulations and semi-analytical results, updated subhalo spatial distributions are derived and included in the CLUMPY code. The latter is used to produce a thousand realizations of the $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ sky. Compared to predictions based on DM only, we conclude a decrease of the flux of the brightest subhalo by a factor 2 to 7 for annihilating DM and no impact on decaying DM: the discovery prospects or limits subhalos can set on DM candidates are affected by the same factor. This study also provides probability density functions for the distance, mass, and angular distribution of the brightest subhalo, among which the mass may hint at its nature: it is most likely a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the case of strong tidal effects from the baryonic potential, whereas it is lighter and possibly a dark halo for DM only or less pronounced tidal effects.","Moritz Hütten, Martin Stref, Céline Combet, Julien Lavalle, David Maurin","20 pages, 5 figures; invited contribution to the Special Issue ""The

813,"Gravitational merging (or clustering) of cosmic objects is regarded as a possible source of the extra-acceleration of the universe at large scale. The merging/clustering of cosmic objects introduces a correction term in the equation of state for the effective present cosmic fluid in the form of $P=w\rho+b\rho^2$. As a result, an alternative relation for the energy density includes over and under-dense regions is obtained that coincide with the conventional relation in the standard limit. By analogy with bubbles, the under-dense regions (voids) in the cosmic fluid is shown to provide the needed negative pressure. Invoking the observational constraint for the dark energy equation of state $w$, we show that the merging of voids will act as a possible source of extra-accelerating at large scale in comparison with non-merging cosmic gas.","Mehrdad Khanpour, Ebrahim Yusofi, Bahman Khanpour","11 pages, 6 figures, Appendix B was added to justify negative

Finding no positive evidence, we set limits on the soliton mass for different values of the ULDM particle mass $m$.

815,"We consider scenarios where the inflaton field decays dominantly to a hidden dark matter (DM) sector. By studying the typical behavior of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field during inflation, we derive a relation between the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and amplitude of the residual DM isocurvature perturbations $\beta$ which is typically generated if the DM is thermally decoupled from the SM sector. We consider different expansion histories and find that if the Universe was radiation- or matter-dominated after inflation, a future discovery of primordial DM isocurvature will rule out all simple scenarios of this type because generating observable $\beta$ from the Higgs is not possible without violating the bounds on $r$. Seen another way, the Higgs field is generically not a threat to models where both the inflaton and DM reside in a decoupled sector. However, this is not necessarily the case for an early kination-dominated epoch, as then the Higgs can source sizeable $\beta$.

The evolution of the neutrino energy distributions is found solving the momentum-dependent kinetic equations with full diagonal collision terms, as in previous analyses of flavour neutrino decoupling in the standard case. The degree of thermalisation of the sterile state is shown in terms of the effective number of neutrinos, $N_{\rm eff}$, and its dependence on the three additional mixing angles ($\theta_{14}$, $\theta_{24}$, $\theta_{34}$) and on the squared mass difference $\Delta m^2_{41}$ is discussed. Our results are relevant for fixing the contribution of a fourth light neutrino species to the cosmological energy density, whose value is very well constrained by the final Planck analysis.

818,"We clarify the subtle issue of finding the correct mapping of Newtonian simulations to light-cone observables at very large distance scales. A faithful general-relativistic interpretation specifies a gauge, i.e. a chart that relates the simulation data to points of the space-time manifold. It has already been pointed out that the implicit gauge choice of Newtonian simulations is indeed different from the Poisson gauge that is commonly adopted for relativistic calculations, the difference being most significant at large scales. It is therefore inconsistent, for example, to predict weak-lensing observables from simulations unless this gauge issue is properly accounted for. Using perturbation theory as well as fully relativistic N-body simulations we quantify the systematic error introduced this way, and we discuss several solutions that would render the calculations relativistically self-consistent.","Julian Adamek, Christian Fidler","10 pages, 5 figures",1905.11721v1,No journal ref found,Christian Fidler,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11721v1,2019-05-28 10:12:44+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,The large-scale general-relativistic correction for Newtonian mocks,2019-05-28 10:12:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11721v1
819,"The S\'ersic or $R^{1/m}$ model has become the de facto standard model to describe the surface brightness profiles of early-type galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies. The photometric, intrinsic, and dynamical properties of this model have been investigated, but mainly for fairly large S\'ersic indices $m$. For small values of $m$, appropriate for low-mass and dwarf ellipticals, a detailed investigation of these properties is still lacking. In this study, we used a combination of numerical and analytical techniques to investigate the S\'ersic model over the entire range of S\'ersic parameters, focussing on the small $m$ regime, where a number of interesting and surprising properties are found. For all values $m<1$, the model is characterised by a finite central luminosity density, and for $m<\tfrac12$, even a central depression in the luminosity density profile. This behaviour translates to the dynamical properties: we show that all S\'ersic models with $m \geqslant\tfrac12$ can be supported by an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor, and that these isotropic models are stable to both radial and non-radial perturbations. The models with $m < \tfrac12$, on the other hand, cannot be supported by an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor.","Maarten Baes, Luca Ciotti","10 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",1905.10359v2,No journal ref found,Luca Ciotti,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10359v2,2019-05-24 17:57:37+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,"Stellar systems following the $R^{1/m}$ luminosity law.

820,"The analysis of the Planck polarization E and B mode power spectra of interstellar dust emission at 353 GHz recently raised new questions on the impact of Galactic foregrounds to the detection of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and on the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). In the diffuse ISM a clear E-B asymmetry is observed, with twice as much power in E modes than in B modes; as well as a positive correlation between the total power, T, and both E and B modes, presently interpreted in terms of the link between the structure of interstellar matter and that of the Galactic magnetic field. In this paper we aim at extending the Planck analysis of the high-latitude sky to low Galactic latitude, investigating the correlation between the TEB power spectra with the gas column density from the diffuse ISM to molecular clouds. We divide the sky between Galactic latitude |b|>5 deg and |b|<60 deg in 552 circular patches and we study the cross-correlations between the TEB power spectra and the column density of each patch using the latest release of the Planck polarization data. We find that the B-to-E power ratio (BB/EE) and the TE correlation ratio (rTE) depend on column density. While the former increases going from the diffuse ISM to molecular clouds in the Gould Belt, the latter decreases. This systematic variation must be related to actual changes in ISM properties. The data show significant scatter about this mean trend. The variations of BB/EE and rTE are observed to be anti-correlated for all column densities. In the diffuse ISM, the variance of these two ratios is consistent with a stochastic non-Gaussian model in which the values of BB/EE and rTE are fixed. We finally discuss the dependencies of TB and EB with column density, which are however hampered by instrumental noise.","Andrea Bracco, Tuhin Ghosh, Francois Boulanger, Jonathan Aumont","Submitted to A&A on May 24, 2019.

821,"ALMA observations of the Serpens South star-forming region suggest that stellar protoclusters may be completely mass segregated at birth. Independent observations also suggest that embedded clusters form segregated by mass. As the primordial mass segregation seems to be lost over time, we aim to study on which timescale an initially perfectly mass-segregated star cluster becomes indistinguishable from an initially not mass-segregated cluster. As an example, the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is also discussed. We used $N$-body simulations of star clusters with various masses and two different degrees of primordial mass segregation. We analysed their energy redistribution through two-body relaxation to quantify the time when the models agree in terms of mass segregation, which sets in only dynamically in the models that are primordially not mass segregated. A comprehensive cross-matched catalogue combining optical, infrared, and X-ray surveys of ONC members was also compiled and made available. The models evolve to a similar radial distribution of high-mass stars after the core collapse (about half a median two-body relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{rh}$) and become observationally indistinguishable from the point of view of mass segregation at time $\tau_\mathrm{v} \approx 3.3\,t_\mathrm{rh}$. In the case of the ONC, using the distribution of high-mass stars, we may not rule out either evolutionary scenario (regardless of whether they are initially mass segregated). When we account for extinction and elongation of the ONC, as reported elsewhere, an initially perfectly mass-segregated state seems to be more consistent with the observed cluster.","Václav Pavlík, Pavel Kroupa, Ladislav Šubr","A&A (in press), 17 pages, 15 figures, data available at CDS",1905.09289v2,No journal ref found,Ladislav Šubr,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09289v2,2019-05-22 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Do star clusters form in a completely mass-segregated way?,2019-05-28 09:03:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09289v2

The source shows multiple X-ray flares in that period when the flux amplitude varies in the range of 27-38%. The X-ray spectra are well fitted with a broken power-law model indicating the presence of both synchrotron and inverse Compton components. We find that the source shows strong and variable emission in the soft energy bands (below 3-4 keV), where the hard band emission is weak and stable. All the soft X-ray bands show correlated variability with zero lag, while a soft lag of -600 s between the 0.3-0.5 and 4-10 keV bands is observed with DCF analysis.

823,"Using a three-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, we have reproduced the fast solar wind in a direct and self-consistent manner, based on the wave/turbulence driven scenario. As a natural consequence of Alfvenic perturbations at its base, highly compressional and turbulent fluctuations are generated, leading to heating and acceleration of the solar wind. The analysis of power spectra and structure functions reveals that the turbulence is characterized by its imbalanced (in the sense of outward Alfvenic fluctuations) and anisotropic nature. The density fluctuation originates from the parametric decay instability of outwardly propagating Alfven waves and plays a significant role in the Alfven wave reflection that triggers turbulence. Our conclusion is that the fast solar wind is heated and accelerated by compressible MHD turbulence driven by parametric decay instability and resultant Alfven wave reflection.","Munehito Shoda, Takeru Ken Suzuki, Mahboubeh Asgari-Targhi, Takaaki Yokoyama","submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters, comments welcome",1905.11685v1,No journal ref found,Takaaki Yokoyama,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11685v1,2019-05-28 08:48:46+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.HE|physics.plasm-ph|physics.space-ph,Three-dimensional simulation of the fast solar wind driven by   compressible MHD turbulence,2019-05-28 08:48:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11685v1
824,"Recently it was shown that the centrifugal instability may be important in the dynamics of astrophysical jets undergoing reconfinement by external pressure. However, these studies were limited to the case of unmagnetised flows. Here we explore the role of the magnetic field within both the Newtonian and relativistic frameworks. Since the jet problem is rather complicated, we focus instead on the simpler problem of cylindrical rotation and axial magnetic field, which shares significant similarity with the jet problem, and consider only axisymmetric perturbations. The studied equilibrium configurations involve a cylindrical interface and they are stable to non-magnetic centrifugal and magneto-rotational instabilities everywhere except this interface. We use a heuristic approach to derive the local stability criterion for the interface in the magnetic case and numerical simulations to verify the role of the magnetic field. The theory and simulations agree quite well for Newtonian models but indicate a potential discrepancy for the relativistic models in the limit of high Lorentz factor of the rotational motion at the interface. In general, the magnetic field sets a critical wavelength below which the centrifugal modes are stabilised. We discuss the implication of our findings for the astrophysical jets, which suggest that the centrifugal instability develops only in jets with relatively low magnetisation. Namely, the magnetic pressure has to be below the thermal one and for the relativistic case the jets have to be kinetic-energy dominated.","Serguei S. Komissarov, Konstantinos N.

825,"Upcoming weak-lensing surveys have the potential to become leading cosmological probes provided all systematic effects are under control. Recently, the ejection of gas due to feedback energy from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been identified as major source of uncertainty, challenging the success of future weak-lensing probes in terms of cosmology. In this paper we investigate the effects of baryons on the number of weak-lensing peaks in the convergence field. Our analysis is based on full-sky convergence maps constructed via light-cones from $N$-body simulations, and we rely on the baryonic correction model of Schneider et al. (2019) to model the baryonic effects on the density field. As a result we find that the baryonic effects strongly depend on the Gaussian smoothing applied to the convergence map. For a DES-like survey setup, a smoothing of $\theta_{\kappa}\gtrsim8$ arcmin is sufficient to keep the baryon signal below the expected statistical error. Smaller smoothing scales lead to a significant suppression of high peaks with $\kappa> 0.2$, while lower peaks are not affected. The situation is more severe for a Euclid-like setup, where a smoothing of $\theta_{\kappa}\gtrsim16$ arcmin is required to keep the baryonic suppression signal below the statistical error. Smaller smoothing scales require a full modelling of baryonic effects since both low and high peaks are strongly affected by baryonic feedback.","Andreas J.

826,"During transient events such as major solar eruptions, the plasma can be far from the equilibrium ionization state because of rapid heating or cooling. Non-equilibrium ionization~(NEI) is important in rapidly evolving systems where the thermodynamical timescale is shorter than the ionization or recombination time scales. We investigate the effects of NEI on EUV and X-ray observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamic Observatory and X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode. Our model assumes that the plasma is initially in ionization equilibrium at low temperature, and it is heated rapidly by a shock or magnetic reconnection. We tabulate the responses of the AIA and XRT passbands as functions of temperature and a characteristic timescale, $n_{e}t$. We find that most of the ions reach equilibrium at $n_{e}t\leq$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$s. Comparing ratios of the responses between different passbands allows us to determine whether a combination of plasmas at temperatures in ionization equilibrium can account for a given AIA and XRT observation. It also expresses how far the observed plasma is from equilibrium ionization. We apply the ratios to a supra-arcade plasma sheet on 2012 January 27. We find that the closer the plasma is to the arcade, the closer it is to a single-temperature plasma in ionization equilibrium. We also utilize the set of responses to estimate the temperature and density for shocked plasma associated with a coronal mass ejection on 2010 June 13. The temperature and density ranges we obtain are in reasonable agreement with previous works.","Jin-Yi Lee, John C. Raymond, Katharine K.

In the present review we discuss on several selected topics regarding these theories, mainly from the theoretical perspective but with due mention of the observational aspect.

829,"In the previous paper [Harada, Cardoso, and Miyata, Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 99} (2019), 044039], it is shown that a hollow transmissive shell collapsing to an ultracompact object of radius very close to its horizon radius generally emits transient Hawking radiation followed by a couple of bursts separated each other by a long time interval. In the current paper, we expand the previous work in two independent directions: changing boundary conditions and specifying the equations of state of the matter. First, we introduce a perfectly reflective surface collapsing to an ultracompact object and find that this model also emits transient Hawking radiation that is followed only by a single burst. Second, we introduce two different collapse dynamics to an ultracompact object and specify the corresponding matter equations of state. We find that transient Hawking radiation is quite commonly seen in early times, while the subsequent bursts strongly depend on the boundary condition and the equation of state or the braking behavior of the surface.","Takafumi Kokubu, Tomohiro Harada","30 pages, 12 figures",1905.07981v2,No journal ref found,Tomohiro Harada,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07981v2,2019-05-20 10:39:57+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Burst particle creation in gravitational collapse to a horizonless   compact object,2019-05-28 00:28:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07981v2
830,"At Pic du Midi observatory we carry out a solar survey with images of the photosphere, prominences and corona. This survey, named CLIMSO (CLIch\'es Multiples du SOleil), is in the following spectral lines: Fe XIII corona (1.075 micron), H-alpha (656.3 nm) and He I (1.083 micron) prominences, H-alpha and Ca II (393.4 nm) photosphere. All frames cover 1.3 times the diameter of the Sun with an angular resolution approaching one arc second. The frame rate is one per minute per channel (weather permitting) for the prominences and chromosphere, and one per hour for the Fe XIII corona. This survey started in 2007 for the disk and prominences, and in 2015 for the corona. We have almost completed one solar cycle, and hope to cover several more, keeping the same wavelengths or adding others. Aims: Make the CLIMSO images easier to use and more profitable for the scientific community. Methods: Providing 'science-ready' data. We have improved the contrast capabilities of our coronagraphs, which now provide images of the Fe XIII corona, in addition to the previous spectral channels. We have also implemented an autoguiding system based on a diffractive Fresnel array for precise positioning of the Sun behind the coronagraphic masks. Results: The data (images and films) are publicly available and downloadable through virtual observatories and dedicated sites: e.g. http://climso.irap.omp.eu. For the H-alpha and and Ca II channels we calibrate the data into physical units, independent of atmospheric or instrumental conditions: we provide solar maps of spectral radiances inW m^-2 sr^-1 nm^-1. The instrumental improvements and the calibration process are presented in this paper.","Laurent Koechlin, Luc Dettwiller, Maurice Audejean, Mael Valais, Arturo Lopez Ariste","7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A",1902.06980v2,No journal ref found,Arturo Lopez Ariste,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06980v2,2019-02-19 10:16:24+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM,The solar survey at Pic du Midi: calibrated data and improved images,2019-05-27 22:50:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06980v2
831,"In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for anomalies with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified anomalies. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33%) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. This corresponds to a selected sample of 1.4% of the initial data sample automatically identified. Among the identified anomalies we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. All code and products of this investigation are made publicly available at: http://xray.sai.msu.ru/snad/.","Maria V. Pruzhinskaya, Konstantin L. Malanchev, Matwey V. Kornilov, Emille E. O.

832,"We present a search for gravitational waves from 221 pulsars with rotation frequencies $\gtrsim 10$ Hz. We use advanced LIGO data from its first and second observing runs spanning 2015-2017, which provides the highest sensitivity gravitational-wave data so far obtained. In this search we target emission from both the $l = m = 2$ mass quadrupole mode, with a frequency at twice that of the pulsar's rotation, and from the $l = 2$, $m = 1$ mode, with a frequency at the pulsar rotation frequency. The search finds no evidence for gravitational-wave emission from any pulsar at either frequency. For the $l = m = 2$ mode search, we provide updated upper limits on the gravitational-wave amplitude, mass quadrupole moment, and fiducial ellipticity for 167 pulsars, and the first such limits for a further 55. For 20 young pulsars these results give limits that are below those inferred from the pulsars' spin-down. For the Crab and Vela pulsars our results constrain gravitational-wave emission to account for less than 0.017% and 0.18% of the spin-down luminosity, respectively. For the recycled millisecond pulsar J0711-6830 our limits are only a factor of 1.3 above the spin-down limit, assuming the canonical value of $10^{38}$ kg m$^2$ for the star's moment of inertia, and imply a gravitational-wave derived upper limit on the star's ellipticity of $1.2\!\times\!10^{-8}$. We also place new limits on the emission amplitude at the rotation frequency of the pulsars.","The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, B. P. Abbott, R. Abbott, T. D. Abbott, S.

For certain sizes and densities of DM clusters, mutual detector-cluster encounters may occur only once a year or every several years leading to the apparent failure of individual experiments searching for DM to discover it. If, however, encounters with Earth size and up to $10^4$ times bigger clusters occur about once a year, then finding time correlations between events in different underground detectors can lead to DM discovery.","Shmuel Nussinov, Yongchao Zhang","18 pages, 3 figure, some changes are made, and references updated",1807.00846v2,No journal ref found,Yongchao Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00846v2,2018-07-02 18:11:42+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE|hep-ex,Dark Matter Clusters and Time Correlations in Direct Detection   Experiments,2019-05-27 21:18:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00846v2

High-resolution high-temperature H2-pressure-broadened spectra are recorded for the CH4 v3-band P-branch. Measured linewidths for 116 transitions between 2840 and 3000 cm^{-1} with temperature and pressures ranging between 300 and 700 K, and 10 and 933 Torr, respectively, were used to find rotation- and tetrahedral-symmetry-dependent coefficients for pressure and temperature broadening and pressure-induced lineshifts.

835,"We present the Multiscale non-Gaussian Segmentation (MnGSeg) analysis technique. This wavelet based method combines the analysis of the probability distribution function (PDF) of map fluctuations as a function of spatial scales and the power spectrum analysis of a map. This technique allows us to extract the non-Gaussianities identified in the multiscaled PDFs usually associated with turbulence intermittency and to spatially reconstruct the Gaussian and the non-Gaussian component of the map. This new technique can be applied on any data set. Here, it is applied on a Herschel column density map of the Polaris flare cloud. The first component has by construction a self-similar fractal geometry as the one produced by fractional Brownian motion simulations. The second component is called the coherent component, by opposition to fractal, and includes a network of filamentary structures which demonstrates a spatial hierarchical scaling, i.e. filaments inside filaments. The power spectrum analysis of both components proves that the Fourier power spectrum of the initial map is dominated by the power of the coherent filamentary structures across almost all spatial scales. The coherent structures contribute progressively, more and more from large to smaller scales, without producing any break in the inertial range. We suggest that this behaviour is induced, at least partly, by inertial-range intermittency, a well known phenomenon for turbulent flows. We also demonstrate that the MnGSeg technique is a very sensitive signal analysis technique, which allows the extraction of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) signal present in the Polaris flare submillimeter observations and the detection of a characteristic scale for 0.1 < l < 0.3 pc whose origin could partly be the transition of regimes dominated by incompressible turbulence versus compressible modes and other physical processes, such as gravity.","J. -F.

836,"We investigate the evolution of isolated, zero and finite temperature, massive, uniformly rotating and highly magnetized white dwarf stars under angular momentum loss driven by magnetic dipole braking. We consider the structure and thermal evolution of white dwarf isothermal cores taking also into account the nuclear burning and neutrino emission processes. We estimate the white dwarf lifetime before it reaches the condition either for a type Ia supernova explosion or for the gravitational collapse to a neutron star. We study white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields from $10^6$ to $10^{9}$~G and masses from $1.39$ to $1.46~M_\odot$ and analyze the behavior of the white dwarf parameters such as moment of inertia, angular momentum, central temperature and magnetic field intensity as a function of lifetime. The magnetic field is involved only to slow down white dwarfs, without affecting their equation of state and structure. In addition, we compute the characteristic time of nuclear reactions and dynamical time scale. The astrophysical consequences of the results are discussed.","Laura Becerra, Kuantay Boshkayev, Jorge.

837,"We present an improved measurement of the Hubble constant (H_0) using the 'inverse distance ladder' method, which adds the information from 207 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) at redshift 0.018 < z < 0.85 to existing distance measurements of 122 low redshift (z < 0.07) SNe Ia (Low-z) and measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Whereas traditional measurements of H_0 with SNe Ia use a distance ladder of parallax and Cepheid variable stars, the inverse distance ladder relies on absolute distance measurements from the BAOs to calibrate the intrinsic magnitude of the SNe Ia. We find H_0 = 67.8 +/- 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1 (statistical and systematic uncertainties, 68% confidence). Our measurement makes minimal assumptions about the underlying cosmological model, and our analysis was blinded to reduce confirmation bias. We examine possible systematic uncertainties and all are below the statistical uncertainties. Our H_0 value is consistent with estimates derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background assuming a LCDM universe (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018).","E. Macaulay, R. C. Nichol, D. Bacon, D.

838,"We present revised stellar properties for 172 K2 target stars that were identified as possible hosts of transiting planets during Campaigns 1-17. Using medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec, we found that 86 of our targets were bona fide cool dwarfs, 74 were hotter dwarfs, and 12 were giants. Combining our spectroscopic metallicities with Gaia parallaxes and archival photometry, we derived photometric stellar parameters and compared them to our spectroscopic estimates. Although our spectroscopic and photometric radius and temperature estimates are consistent, our photometric mass estimates are systematically 0.11 solar masses (34%) higher than our spectroscopic mass estimates for the least massive stars (photometric mass estimates < 0.4 solar masses). Adopting the photometric parameters and comparing our results to parameters reported in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog, our revised stellar radii are 0.15 solar radii (40%) larger and our revised stellar effective temperatures are roughly 65K cooler. Correctly determining the properties of K2 target stars is essential for characterizing any associated planet candidates, estimating the planet search sensitivity, and calculating planet occurrence rates. Even though Gaia parallaxes have increased the power of photometric surveys, spectroscopic characterization remains essential for determining stellar metallicities and investigating correlations between stellar metallicity and planetary properties.","Courtney D.

Bayesian and frequentist methods that address these questions often rely on a likelihood function, which is the key ingredient in order to assess the plausibility of model parameters given observed data. In some complex systems or experimental setups, predicting the outcome of a model cannot be done analytically, and Monte Carlo techniques are used. In this paper, we present a new analytic likelihood that takes into account Monte Carlo uncertainties, appropriate for use in the large and small sample size limits. Our formulation performs better than semi-analytic methods, prevents strong claims on biased statements, and provides improved coverage properties compared to available methods.","Carlos A.

The CXB therefore serves as a constraint on the integrated SMBH growth in the Universe and the accretion physics and obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This paper gives an overview of recent progress in understanding the high-energy (>~10 keV) X-ray emission from AGNs and the synthesis of the CXB, with an emphasis on results from NASA's NuSTAR hard X-ray mission. We then discuss remaining challenges and open questions regarding the nature of AGN obscuration and AGN physics.

841,"We use two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) and \textit{EnLink}, as a single approach to identify stellar groupings in the Orion star-forming complex as an application to the 5-dimensional astrometric data from Gaia DR2. The algorithms present two different ways to limit user bias when evaluating the relative weights among the astrometric parameters, automatically determined by the machine and through a standard procedure by monitoring several outcome measures. Both algorithms complement each other and produce similar stellar groups. Because SNN groups have a much smaller spread in proper motions compared to \textit{EnLink}, we use \textit{EnLink}, which requires no input, as a first pass tool for group identification and validation. We then used the SNN algorithm to dissect the Orion star-forming complex. We identify 21 spatially- and kinematically-coherent groups in the Orion complex, nine of which previously unknown. The groups show a wide distribution of distances extending as far as about 150 pc in front of the star-forming Orion clouds, to about 50 pc beyond them where we find, unexpectedly, three groups. Our results expose to view the wealth of sub-structure in the OB association, within and beyond the classical Blaauw Orion OBI sub-groups.

842,"A weakly interacting dark matter candidate is very difficult to detect at high-energy colliders like the LHC, if its mass is close to, or higher than, a TeV. We argue that the pair-annihilation of such particles may give rise to $e^+ e^-$-pairs in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph), which in turn can lead to radio synchrotron signals that are detectable at the upcoming square kilometre array (SKA) telescope within a fairly moderate observation time. We investigate in detail the underlying mechanisms that make this possible. Both particle physics issues and those pertaining to astrophysics, such as diffusion, electromagnetic energy loss and the effects of interstellar magnetic field, are examined with reference to their roles in generating radio flux. We first identify the detectability criteria in a model-independent manner. It is observed that fluxes may be detectable for scenarios that are consistent with all constraints available till date from $\gamma$-ray and cosmic-ray observations. Thereafter, using benchmarks based on popular scenarios involving physics beyond the standard model, we show that it should be possible to detect the radio flux from a dSph like Draco with 100 hours of observation at the SKA, for dark matter particle masses upto 4-8 TeV. The corresponding frequency distributions are also presented, where it is found that the frequency range 300 MHz - 50 GHz is especially useful for recording the annihilation signals of trans-TeV particles.","Arpan Kar, Sourav Mitra, Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury","27 pages, 14 figures",1905.11426v1,No journal ref found,Tirthankar Roy Choudhury,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11426v1,2019-05-27 18:03:25+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,Heavy dark matter particle annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies:   radio signals at the SKA telescope,2019-05-27 18:03:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11426v1
843,"In this paper, we verify the large scale structure consistency relations using N-body simulations, including modes in the highly non-linear regime. These relations (pointed out by Kehagias & Riotto and Peloso & Pietroni) follow from the symmetry of the dynamics under a shift of the Newtonian potential by a constant and a linear gradient, and predict the absence of certain poles in the ratio between the (equal time) squeezed bispectrum and power spectrum. The consistency relations, as symmetry statements, are exact, but have not been previously checked beyond the perturbative regime. Our test using N-body simulations not only offers a non-perturbative check, but also serves as a warm-up exercise for applications to observational data. A number of subtleties arise when taking the squeezed limit of the bispectrum--we show how to circumvent or address them. An interesting by-product of our investigation is an explicit demonstration that the linear-gradient symmetry is unaffected by the periodic boundary condition of the simulations. Lastly, we verify using simulations that the consistency relations are violated when the initial conditions are non-gaussian (of the local fNL type). The methodology developed here paves the way for constraining primordial non-gaussianity using large scale structure data, including (numerous) highly non-linear modes that are otherwise hard to interpret and utilize.","Angelo Esposito, Lam Hui, Roman Scoccimarro","10 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",1905.11423v1,No journal ref found,Roman Scoccimarro,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11423v1,2019-05-27 18:01:33+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-th,A non-perturbative test of consistency relations and their violation,2019-05-27 18:01:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11423v1
844,"The TRAPPIST-1 system has 7 known terrestrial planets arranged compactly in a mean-motion resonant chain around an ultra-cool central star, some within the estimated habitable zone. Given their short orbital periods of just a few days, it is often presumed that the planets are likely tidally locked such that the spin rate is equal to that of the orbital mean motion. However, the compact, and resonant, nature of the system implies that there can be significant variations in the mean motion of these planets due to their mutual interactions. Such fluctuations create a moving target between the spin rotation rate and the orbital mean motion, which we show can then have significant effects on the spin states of these planets. In this paper, we analyze, using detailed numerical simulations, the mean motion histories of the three planets that are thought to lie within or close to the habitable zone of the system: planets d, e, and f. We demonstrate that, depending on the strength of the mutual interactions within the system, these planets can be pushed into spin states which are effectively non-synchronous. We find that it can produce significant wobble of the spin state, if not complete circulation in the co-rotating frame. We also show that these spin states are likely to be unable to sustain long-term stability, with many of our simulations suggesting that the spin evolves, under the influence of tidal synchronization forces, into quasi-stable attractor states, which last on timescales of thousands of years.","Alec M.

845,"Even with several thousand {\it Fermi}-LAT blazar detections, the $\gamma$-ray emission mechanism is poorly understood. We explore correlated optical/$\gamma$-ray flux variations for 178 {\it Fermi}-LAT blazars regularly monitored by KAIT, SMARTS, and the Steward Observatory. Out of the 178 sources, 121 show a measurable ($>1\sigma$) discrete correlation function peak. Using the derived time-lags and Bayesian block light-curve decompositions, we measure the fraction of common and orphan flares between the two bands. After accounting for sampling and sensitivity limitations we quantify for the first time the true orphan flare rates of optical and $\gamma$-ray flares: 54.5\% of optical and 20\% of $\gamma$-ray flares are orphan events. Both the intraband temporal relation and the small orphan $\gamma$-ray flare fraction point toward leptonic processes as the likely mechanism for the high-energy emission. Motivated to discriminate between synchrotron self-Compton and external-Compton dominance in individual sources, we use the flux-flux variations to determine the slope $m$ of the ${\rm log}\,f_{\rm opt} - {\rm log}\,f_{\gamma}$ dependence. The slope distribution suggests a bimodal population with high and intermediate synchrotron-peak objects showing larger $m$ than low synchrotron-peak objects. We find that $m$ is naturally decreased through pollution from the orphan (typically optical) flares and develop a method to statistically recover, given the sources' measured orphan flare rate, the intrinsic $m$. While source classes show composite behavior, the majority of BL Lac objects favor $m=2$, indicating a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the $\gamma$-rays. No preference for either $m$ is found in flat spectrum radio quasars.","I. Liodakis, R. W. Romani, A. V. Filippenko, D. Kocevski, W.

846,"We test the use of long-wavelength dust continuum emission as a molecular gas tracer at high redshift, via a unique sample of 12, z~2 galaxies with observations of both the dust continuum and CO(1-0) line emission (obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, respectively). Our work is motivated by recent, high redshift studies that measure molecular gas masses (\ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}) via a calibration of the rest-frame $850\mu$m luminosity ($L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$) against the CO(1-0)-derived \ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}\ of star-forming galaxies. We hereby test whether this method is valid for the types of high-redshift, star-forming galaxies to which it has been applied. We recover a clear correlation between the rest-frame $850\mu$m luminosity, inferred from the single-band, long-wavelength flux, and the CO(1-0) line luminosity, consistent with the samples used to perform the $850\mu$m calibration. The molecular gas masses, derived from $L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$, agree to within a factor of two with those derived from CO(1-0). We show that this factor of two uncertainty can arise from the values of the dust emissivity index and temperature that need to be assumed in order to extrapolate from the observed frequency to the rest-frame at 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$. The extrapolation to 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$ therefore has a smaller effect on the accuracy of \Mmol\ derived via single-band dust-continuum observations than the assumed CO(1-0)-to-\ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}\ conversion factor. We therefore conclude that single-band observations of long-wavelength dust emission can be used to reliably constrain the molecular gas masses of massive, star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$.","Melanie Kaasinen, Nick Z.

847,"Motivated by the recently discovered kinematic ""Hubble sequence"" shown by the stellar orbit-circularity distribution of 260 CALIFA galaxies, we make use of a comparable galaxy sample at z = 0 with a stellar mass range from 5E9 to 5E11 solar masses, selected from the IllustrisTNG simulation and study their stellar orbit compositions in relation to a number of other fundamental galaxy properties.We find that the TNG100 simulation broadly reproduces the observed fractions of different orbital components and their stellar mass dependencies. In particular, the mean mass dependencies of the luminosity fractions for the kinematically warm and hot orbits are well reproduced within model uncertainties of the observed galaxies. The simulation also largely reproduces the observed peak and trough features at a stellar mass of 1-2E10 solar masses, in the mean distributions of the cold- and hot-orbit fractions, respectively, indicating fewer cooler orbits and more hotter orbits in both more- and less-massive galaxies beyond such a mass range. Several marginal disagreements are seen between the simulation and observations: the average cold-orbit (counter-rotating) fractions of the simulated galaxies below (above) a stellar mass of 6E10 solar masses, are systematically higher than the observational data by < 10% (absolute orbital fraction); the simulation also seems to produce more scatter for the cold-orbit fraction and less so for the non-cold orbits at any given galaxy mass. Possible causes that stem from the adopted heating mechanisms are discussed.","Dandan Xu, Ling Zhu, Robert Grand, Volker Springel, Shude Mao, Glenn van de Ven, Shengdong Lu, Yougang Wang, Annalisa Pillepich, Shy Genel, Dylan Nelson, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Ruediger Pakmor, Rainer Weinberger, Federico Marinacci, Mark Vogelsberger, Paul Torrey, Naiman Jill, Lars Hernquist","12 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to MNRAS.

848,"The Milky Way lies in a thin plane, the Local Sheet, a part of a wall bounding the Local Void lying toward the north supergalactic pole. Galaxies with accurate distances both above and below this supergalactic equatorial plane have systematically negative peculiar velocities. The interpretation of this situation is that the Local Void is expanding, giving members of the Local Sheet deviant velocities toward the south supergalactic pole. The few galaxies within the void are evacuating the void. Galaxies in a filament in the supergalactic south are not feeling the expansion so their apparent motion toward us is mainly a reflex of our motion. The model of the local velocity field was uncertain because the apex of our motion away from the Local Void lies in obscurity near the Galactic plane. Here, results of Hubble Space Telescope infrared observations are reported that find tip of the red giant branch distances to four obscured galaxies. All the distances are $\sim7$ Mpc, revealing that these galaxies are part of a continuous filamentary structure passing between the north and south Galactic hemispheres and sharing the same kinematic signature of peculiar velocities toward us. A fifth galaxy nearby in projection, GALFA-DW4, has an ambiguous distance. If nearby at $\sim 3$ Mpc, this galaxy has an anomalous velocity away from us of +348 km/s. Alternatively, perhaps the resolved stars are on the asymptotic giant branch and the galaxy is beyond 6 Mpc whence the observed velocity would not be unusual.","Gagandeep S. Anand, R.

849,"We use the SPHINX suite of high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study how spatially and temporally inhomogeneous reionization impacts the baryonic content of dwarf galaxies and cosmic filaments. The SPHINX simulations simultaneously capture the large-scale process of reionization, model the escape of ionising radiation from thousands of galaxies, and resolve haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold. This makes them an ideal tool for examining how reionization impacts star formation and the gas content of dwarf galaxies. We compare simulations with and without stellar radiation to isolate the effects of radiation feedback from that of supernova, cosmic expansion, and numerical resolution. We find that the gas content of cosmic filaments can be reduced by more than 80% following reionization. The gas inflow rates into haloes with $M_{vir}\lesssim10^8M_{\odot}$ are strongly affected and are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the simulation without reionization. A significant increase in gas outflow rates is found for halo masses $M_{vir}\lesssim7\times10^7M_{\odot}$. Our simulations show that inflow suppression (i.e. starvation), rather than photoevaporation, is the dominant mechanism by which the baryonic content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is regulated. At fixed redshift and halo mass, there is a large scatter in the halo baryon fractions that is entirely dictated by the timing of reionization in the local region surrounding a halo. Finally, although the gas content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is significantly impacted by reionization, we find that most haloes with $M_{vir}\lesssim10^8M_{\odot}$ can remain self-shielded and form stars long after reionization, until their local gas reservoir is depleted, suggesting that local group dwarf galaxies do not necessarily exhibit star formation histories that peak prior to $z=6$.","Harley Katz, Marius Ramsoy, Joakim Rosdahl, Taysun Kimm, Jeremy Blaizot, Martin G.

850,"We study the kinematical properties of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization via the [CII] 158$\mu$m line emission. The line profile provides information on the kinematics as well as structural properties such as the presence of a disk and satellites. To understand how these properties are encoded in the line profile, first we develop analytical models from which we identify disk inclination and gas turbulent motions as the key parameters affecting the line profile. To gain further insights, we use ""Althaea"", a highly-resolved ($30\, \rm pc$) simulated prototypical Lyman Break Galaxy, in the redshift range $z = 6-7$, when the galaxy is in a very active assembling phase. Based on morphology, we select three main dynamical stages: I) Merger , II) Spiral Disk, and III) Disturbed Disk. We identify spectral signatures of merger events, spiral arms, and extra-planar flows in I), II), and III), respectively. We derive a generalised dynamical mass vs. [CII]-line FWHM relation. If precise information on the galaxy inclination is (not) available, the returned mass estimate is accurate within a factor $2$ ($4$). A Tully-Fisher relation is found for the observed high-$z$ galaxies, i.e. $L_{\rm[CII]}\propto (FWHM)^{1.80\pm 0.35}$ for which we provide a simple, physically-based interpretation. Finally, we perform mock ALMA simulations to check the detectability of [CII]. When seen face-on, Althaea is always detected at $> 5\sigma$; in the edge-on case it remains undetected because the larger intrinsic FWHM pushes the line peak flux below detection limit. This suggests that some of the reported non-detections might be due to inclination effects.","M. Kohandel, A. Pallottini, A. Ferrara, A. Zanella, C. Behrens, S. Carniani, S. Gallerani, L.

851,"We show for the first time that the loop-driven kinetic mixing between visible and dark Abelian gauge bosons can facilitate dark matter production in the early Universe by creating a 'dynamic' portal, which depends on the energy of the process. The required smallness of the strength of the portal interaction, suited for freeze-in, is justified by a suppression arising from the mass of a heavy vector-like fermion. The strong temperature sensitivity associated with the interaction is responsible for most of the dark matter production during the early stages of reheating.","Avik Banerjee, Gautam Bhattacharyya, Debtosh Chowdhury, Yann Mambrini","8 pages, 4 figures; Comments are welcome",1905.11407v1,No journal ref found,Yann Mambrini,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11407v1,2019-05-27 18:00:02+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE,Dark matter seeping through dynamic gauge kinetic mixing,2019-05-27 18:00:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11407v1

853,"A fundamental property determining the transient behaviour of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni synthesised in the explosion. Using established methods, this is a relatively easy parameter to extract from observations. Here I provide a meta analysis of all published $^{56}$Ni masses for CCSNe. Collating a total of 258 literature $^{56}$Ni masses I compare distributions of the main CCSN types: SNeII; SNeIIb; SNeIb; SNeIc; and SNeIcBL. Using these published values, I calculate a median $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.032${\rm\ M}_\odot$ for SNeII (N=115), 0.102${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=27) for SNeIIb, SNeIb = 0.163${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=33), SNeIc = 0.155${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=48), and SNeIcBL = 0.369${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=32). On average, stripped-enevelope SNe (SE-SNe: IIb; Ib; Ic; and Ic-BL) have much higher values than SNeII. These observed distributions are compared to those predicted from neutrino-driven explosion models. While the SNII distribution follows model predictions, the SE-SNe have a significant fraction of events with $^{56}$Ni masses much higher than predicted. If the majority of published $^{56}$Ni masses are to be believed, these results imply significant differences in the progenitor structures and/or explosion properties between SNeII and SE-SNe. However, such distinct progenitor and explosion properties are not currently favoured in the literature. Alternatively, the popular methods used to estimate $^{56}$Ni masses for SE-SNe may not be accurate. Possible issues with these methods are discussed, as are the implications of true $^{56}$Ni mass differences on progenitor properties of different CCSNe.",J. P.

854,"Quantifying the physical conditions that allow radiation emitted shortward of the hydrogen ionization edge at 911.7 {\AA} to escape the first collapsed objects and ultimately reionize the universe is a compelling problem for astrophysics. The escape of LyC emission from star-forming galaxies and AGN is intimately tied to the emergence and sustenance of the metagalactic ionizing background that pervades the universe to the present day and in turn is tied to the emergence of structure at all epochs. JWST was built in part to search for the source(s) responsible for reionization, but it cannot observe LyC escape directly, because of the progressive increase in the mean transmission of the intergalactic medium towards the epoch of reionization. Remarkable progress has been made to date in directly detecting LyC leaking from star-forming galaxies using space-based and the ground-based observatories, but there remain significant gaps in our redshift coverage of the phenomenon. Ongoing projects to measure LyC escape at low- and intermediate-z will provide guidance to JWST investigations by analyzing the robustness of a set of proposed LyC escape proxies, and also provide a closeup examination of the physical conditions that favor LyC escape. However, currently available facilities are inadequate for deeply probing LyC escape at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. Doing so will require facilities that can detect LyC emission in the restframe to limiting magnitudes approaching 28 $< m^*_{(1+z)900} <$ 32 for $M^*_{(1+z)1500}$ galaxies. The goal of acquiring statistically robust samples for determining LyC luminosity functions across cosmic time will require multi-object spectroscopy from spacebased flagship class and groundbased ELT class telescopes along with ancillary panchromatic imaging and spectroscopy spanning the far-UV to the mid-IR.","Stephan R.

855,"In axion gauge field inflation an axion-like particle driving cosmic inflation is coupled to the Chern-Simons density of an Abelian or non-Abelian gauge group. In the case of a non-Abelian gauge group, this can lead to the formation of a stable, homogeneous and isotropic gauge field background. We study the dynamics of the inflaton and gauge fields in terms of the two effective coupling parameters: the gauge coupling and the axion decay constant. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the far past, we find that the non-trivial gauge field background arises only significantly after the cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales have left the horizon. At these scales, the model thus closely resembles Abelian axion inflation, thereby naturally reconciling the tension of non-Abelian axion gauge field inflation with the latest CMB observations. We further consider two exemplary UV-completions of this setup: multiple Peccei-Quinn axions and axion monodromy in string theory. In both cases we find that the majority of the parameter space is excluded by theoretical or observational constraints. The remaining parameter space can be divided into three regimes. (i) For small gauge couplings we recover natural inflation. For large gauge couplings the non-Abelian gauge theory either (ii) mimics the Abelian theory or (iii) non-linear interactions prohibit a linear analysis of the gauge field perturbations.","Valerie Domcke, Stefan Sandner","32 pages, 5 figures",1905.11372v1,No journal ref found,Stefan Sandner,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11372v1,2019-05-27 17:55:50+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,The Different Regimes of Axion Gauge Field Inflation,2019-05-27 17:55:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11372v1
856,"We study observational constraints on a dark energy model in the framework of Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi theories, which extends the Galileon ghost condensate (GGC) to the domain of beyond Horndeski theories. We show that the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, combined with datasets of baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae type Ia, and redshift-space distortions, give the tight upper bound $|\alpha_{\rm H}^{(0)}| \le {\cal O}(10^{-6})$ on today's beyond-Horndeski (BH) parameter $\alpha_{\rm H}$. This is mostly attributed to the shift of CMB acoustic peaks induced by the early-time changes of cosmological background and perturbations arising from the dominance of $\alpha_{\rm H}$ in the dark energy density. In comparison to the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, our BH model suppresses the large-scale integrated-Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) tail of CMB temperature anisotropies due to the existence of cubic Galileons, and it modifies the small-scale CMB power spectrum because of the different background evolution. We find that the BH model fits the data better than $\Lambda$CDM according to the $\chi^2$ statistics, yet the deviance information criterion (DIC) slightly favors the latter. Given the fact that the BH model with $\alpha_{\rm H}=0$ (i.e., the GGC model) is favored over $\Lambda$CDM even by the DIC, there are no particular signatures for the departure from Horndeski theories in current observations.","Simone Peirone, Giampaolo Benevento, Noemi Frusciante, Shinji Tsujikawa","17 pages, 12 figures",1905.11364v1,No journal ref found,Shinji Tsujikawa,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11364v1,2019-05-27 17:48:59+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,First cosmological constraints and phenomenology of a beyond-Horndeski   model,2019-05-27 17:48:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11364v1
857,"Shells are fine stellar structures identified by their arc-like shapes present around a galaxy and currently thought to be vestiges of galaxy interactions and/or mergers. The study of their number, geometry, stellar populations and gas content can help to derive the interaction/merger history of a galaxy. Numerical simulations have proposed a mechanism of shell formation through phase wrapping during a radial minor merger. Alternatively, there could be barely a space wrapping, when particles have not made any radial oscillation yet, but are bound by their radial expansion, or produce an edge-brightened feature. These can be distinguished, because they are expected to keep a high radial velocity. While shells are first a stellar phenomenon, HI and CO observations have revealed neutral gas associated with shells. Some of the gas, the most diffuse and dissipative, is expected to be driven quickly to the center if it is travelling on nearly radial orbits. Molecular gas, distributed in dense clumps, is less dissipative, and may be associated to shells, and determine their velocity, too difficult to obtain from stars. We present here a search for molecular gas in nine shell galaxies with the IRAM-30m telescope. Six of them are detected in their galaxy center, and in three galaxies, we clearly detect molecular gas in shells. The derived amount of molecular gas varies from 1.5 10$^8$ to 3.4 10$^9$ M$_\odot$ in the shells. For two of them (Arp~10 and NGC~3656), the shells are characteristic of an oblate system. Their velocity is nearly systemic, and we conclude that these shells are phase-wrapped. For the third one (NGC~3934) the shells appear to participate to the rotation, and follow up with higher spatial resolution is required to conclude.","Brisa Mancillas, Francoise Combes, Pierre-Alain Duc",13 pages. 25 figures. 3 Tables. 1 Appendix,1905.11356v1,No journal ref found,Pierre-Alain Duc,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11356v1,2019-05-27 17:33:49+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The molecular gas content of shell galaxies,2019-05-27 17:33:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11356v1
858,"Gravitational waves from coalescence of a Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and its accompagning short Gamma-Ray Burst GW/GRB~170817A confirmed the presumed origin of these puzzeling transients and opened up the way for relating properties of short GRBs to those of their progenitor stars and their surroundings. Here we review an extensive analysis of the prompt gamma-ray and late afterglows of this event. We show that a fraction of polar ejecta from the merger had been accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds. This structured jet had an initial Lorentz factor of about $260$ in our direction - $\mathcal{O}(10^\circ)$ from the jet's axis - and was a few orders of magnitude less dense than in typical short GRBs. At the time of arrival to circum-burst material the ultra-relativistic jet had a close to Gaussian profile and a Lorentz factor $\gtrsim 130$ in its core. It had retained in some extent its internal collimation and coherence, but had extended laterally to create mildly relativistic lobes - a {\it cocoon}. External shocks on the far from center inhomogeneous circum-burst material and low density of colliding shells generated slow rising afterglows. The circum-burst material was somehow correlated with the merger and it is possible that it contained recently ejected material from glitching, which had resumed due to the deformation of neutron stars crust by tidal forces in the latest stages of inspiral but well before their merger. By comparing these findings with the results of relativistic MHD simulations and observed gravitational waves we conclude that progenitor neutron stars were old, had close masses and highly reduced magnetic fields. In addition, they probably had oppositely directed spins due to the encounter and gravitational interaction with other stars.",Houri Ziaeepour,"30 pages; 11 figures. Invited review for special issue

The CO$_\textrm{core}$ explodes as a supernova (SN) leaving at its center a new NS ($\nu$NS). The SN hypercritically ejecta accretes onto the NS/BH companion. BdHNe I are the tightest binaries where the accretion leads the initial NS gravitationally collapses to a BH. In BdHN II the accretion onto the NS is lower, there is no BH formation. We infer for GRB 190114C and other selected examples of BdHN I (GRB 130427A, GRB 160509A, GRB 160625B), BdHN II (GRB 180728A) the intensity and structure of the $\nu$NS magnetic field needed for the explanation of the afterglow via synchrotron emission powered by the newborn NS. In the case of the BdHNe I, we infer as well the properties of the magnetic field around the newborn BH, requested for the explanation of the observed GeV emission through what we have called the ``inner engine'': the rotating BH surrounded by a magnetic field and matter from the SN ejecta. We also discuss the possible nature of the magnetic field both the one of the $\nu$NS and the one around the newborn BH.","Jorge A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, M. Karlica, R. Moradi, Y.

862,"In this work we investigate the possible condensation of tetraneutron resonant states in the lower density neutron rich gas regions in the interior of Neutron Stars (NSs). Using an effective field theoretical approach we characterize the system containing different hadronic species including, besides tetraneutrons, nucleons, a set of light clusters ($^3$He, $\alpha$ particles, deuterium and tritium) and $\Delta$-isobars. $\sigma,\omega$ and $\rho$ mesonic fields provide the interaction. Assuming they can be thermodynamically produced in an equilibrated medium and scanning a range of coupling strengths to the mesonic fields from prescriptions based on isospin symmetry arguments, we study how their presence could significantly impact the nucleon pairing fractions and distribution of baryonic charge among species. We find that tetraneutrons may appear over a range of densities belonging to the outer NS crust carrying a sizable amount of baryonic charge and depleting the nucleon pairing fractions.","O.

863,"The central region of a circumstellar disk is difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of collapsing cloud cores, but its effect on the evolution of the entire disk can be significant. We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations to model the long-term evolution of self-gravitating and viscous circumstellar disks in the thin-disk limit. Simulations start from the gravitational collapse of prestellar cores of 0.5--1.0~$M_\odot$ and both gaseous and dusty subsystems were considered, including a model for dust growth. The inner unresolved 1.0 au of the disk is replaced with a central ``smart'' cell (CSC) -- a simplified model that simulates physical processes that may occur in this region. We found that the mass transport rate through the CSC has an appreciable effect on the evolution of the entire disk. Models with slow mass transport form more massive and warmer disks and they are more susceptible to gravitational instability and fragmentation, including a newly identified episodic mode of disk fragmentation in the T Tauri phase of disk evolution. Models with slow mass transport through the CSC feature episodic accretion and luminosity bursts in the early evolution, while models with fast transport are characterized by a steadily declining accretion rate with low-amplitude flickering. Dust grows to a larger, decimeter size in the slow transport models and efficiently drifts in the CSC, where it accumulates reaching the limit when streaming instability becomes operational. We argue that gravitational instability, together with streaming instability likely operating in the inner disk regions, constitute two concurrent planet-forming mechanisms, which may explain the observed diversity of exoplanetary orbits (Abridged).","Eduard I.

864,"The internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations in Globular Clusters (GCs) provide unique constraints on the physical processes responsible for their formation. Specifically, the present-day kinematics of cluster stars, such as rotation and velocity dispersion, seem to be related to the initial configuration of the system. In a recent work, we analyzed for the first time the kinematics of the different stellar populations in NGC 0104 over a large field of view, exploiting the Gaia Data Release 2 proper motions combined with multi-band ground-based photometry. In this paper, we extend this analysis to six GCs, namely NGC 0288, NGC 5904, NGC 6121, NGC 6752 and NGC 6838 and further explore NGC 0104. Among the analyzed clusters only NGC 0104 and NGC 5904 show significant rotation in the plane of the sky. By separating our sample in 1G and 2G stars we find that overall these two populations exhibit a similar rotation pattern in NGC 0104. However, some hints of different rotations between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the external regions of this cluster. Interestingly, 1G and 2G stars in NGC 5904 exhibit different rotation curves, with distinct phases. The radial components of the motion of 1G and 2G stars show different radial trends, in contrast with what is observed in most of the other clusters. There is no evidence for rotation among the selected 1G and 2G stars of the remaining clusters. The analysis of the velocity-dispersion profiles of multiple populations confirms that 2G stars of NGC 0104 show stronger anisotropy than the 1G.","G. Cordoni, A. P. Milone, A.

865,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), often associated with flares, are the most powerful magnetic phenomena occurring on the Sun. Stars show magnetic activity levels up to 10^4 times higher, and CME effects on stellar physics and circumstellar environments are predicted to be significant. However, stellar CMEs remain observationally unexplored. Using time-resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of a stellar flare on the active star HR 9024 observed with Chandra/HETGS, we distinctly detected Doppler shifts in S XVI, Si XIV, and Mg XII lines that indicate upward and downward motions of hot plasmas (~10-25 MK) within the flaring loop, with velocity v~100-400 km/s, in agreement with a model of flaring magnetic tube. Most notably, we also detected a later blueshift in the O VIII line which reveals an upward motion, with v=90+/-30 km/s, of cool plasma (~4 MK), that we ascribe to a CME coupled to the flare. From this evidence we were able to derive a CME mass of 1x10^21 g and a CME kinetic energy of 5x10^34 erg. These values provide clues in the extrapolation of the solar case to higher activity levels, suggesting that CMEs could indeed be a major cause of mass and angular momentum loss.","C. Argiroffi, F.

866,"Black hole systems, comprised of a black hole, accretion disk, and collimated outflow are studied here. Three AGN samples including 753 AGN, and 102 measurements of 4 GBH are studied. Applying the theoretical considerations described by Daly (2016), general expressions for the black hole spin function and accretion disk magnetic field strength are presented and applied to obtain the black hole spin function, spin, and accretion disk magnetic field strength in dimensionless and physical units for each source. Relatively high spin values are obtained; spin functions indicate typical spin values of about (0.6 - 1) for the sources. The distribution of accretion disk magnetic field strengths for the three AGN samples are quite similar and have mean values of about $10^4$ G, while those for individual GBH are similar and have mean values of about $10^8$ G. Good agreement is found between spin values obtained here and published values obtained with well-established methods; comparisons for 1 GBH and 6 AGN indicate that similar spin values are obtained with independent methods.

CMDs were obtained, on one hand, after properly decontaminating the observed diagrams from background/foreground disc stars and other sources. On the other hand, CMDs were also obtained based upon star selection in proper motion diagrams. Taking into account our deep CMDs and LFs analyses, we find that 17 out of 22 new GC candidates may be real and should therefore be followed-up, while 5 candidates were discarded from the original sample. We also search for RR Lyrae and Mira variable stars in the fields of these new GC candidates. In particular, we confirm that Minni 40 may be a real cluster. If confirmed by further follow-up analysis, it would be the closest GC to the Galactic centre in projected angular distance, located only 0.5 deg away from it.

We model the available broad-band data of both GRBs with the synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission of the afterglow shocks. We find that the sub-TeV emission of of GRB 180720B can be interpreted as the SSC emission for a constant density circum-burst medium. The SSC emission of GRB 190114C dominates over the synchrotron component from GeV energies at 100 s, which can explain the possible hard spectrum of the GeV emission at this time. The extrapolated flux of this SSC component to sub-TeV energies can explain the high-significance detection of GRB 190114C by the MAGIC telescope. The parameter values (such as the circum-burst density and shock microphysical parameters) in the modeling are not unusual for both GRBs, implying that the detection of sub-TeV photons from these two bursts should be attributed to their large burst energies and low redshifts.","Xiang-Yu Wang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Hai-Ming Zhang, Shao-Qiang Xi, Bing Zhang",No comment found,1905.11312v1,No journal ref found,Bing Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11312v1,2019-05-27 15:54:06+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Synchrotron self-Compton emission from afterglow shocks as the origin of   the sub-TeV emission in GRB 180720B and GRB 190114C,2019-05-27 15:54:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11312v1
870,"Several lines of evidence suggest that as dark matter haloes grow their scale radius increases, and that the density in their central region drops. Major mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain both these phenomena, and the resulting patterns in the concentration--mass--redshift relation. To test this possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety of cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The remnants typically have higher densities than the initial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions. They are reasonably well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from those of the initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant, relative to the internal energy of the initial conditions, $\kappa$, has the greatest influence on the properties of the final mass distribution. As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, {\it increasing} in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10--20\%), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger. We conclude that while major mergers can produce remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively ineffective at changing the central densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to explain the mean trends in the concentration--mass--redshift relation.","Nicole E.

871,"The structural properties of individual dark matter haloes, including shape, spin, concentration, and substructure, are linked to the halo's growth history, but the exact connection between the two is unclear. One open question, in particular, is the effect of major mergers on halo structure. We have performed a large set of simulations of binary equal-mass mergers between isolated haloes with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant. In this paper we describe our initial set-up and analysis methods, and report on the results for the size, shape, and spin of the merger remnant. The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter $\kappa$ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter $\lambda$. We find that the axis ratio $c/a$ scales roughly linearly with energy $\kappa$ while the axis ratio $c/b$ scales linearly with spin $\lambda$. Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants. The spin of the remnant can be predicted from angular momentum conservation, while the overall size changes as $\sim \kappa^{-5}$, as expected from self-similar scaling at constant mean density. We discuss potential cosmological applications for these simple patterns.","Nicole E. Drakos, James E. Taylor, Anael Berrouet, Aaron S. G.

Therefore, water can be in liquid state at their surface being essential for life. Recent studies suggest that these planets formed beyond the snow line in a water-rich region. The initial water reservoir can be lost during the planet formation due to the stellar activity of the infant low-mass star. However, a potential subsequent water delivery event, like the late heavy bombardment (LHB) in the Solar System, can replenish planetary water reservoirs. To study this water delivery process, we set up a simple model in which an additional 5 M_Earth--50 M_Earth planet is embedded in a water-rich asteroid belt beyond the snow line of TRAPPIST-1. Asteroids perturbed out from the chaotic zone of the putative planet can enter into the inner system and accreted by the known planets.

876,"This study is part of the project ``CORE'', an IRAM/NOEMA large program consisting of observations of the millimeter continuum and molecular line emission towards 20 selected high-mass star forming regions. We focus on IRAS23385+6053, which is believed to be the least evolved source of the CORE sample. The observations were performed at ~1.4 mm and employed three configurations of NOEMA and additional single-dish maps, merged with the interferometric data to recover the extended emission. Our correlator setup covered a number of lines from well-known hot core tracers and a few outflow tracers. The angular (~0.45""$-$0.9"") and spectral (0.5 km/s) resolutions were sufficient to resolve the clump in IRAS23385+6053 and investigate the existence of large-scale motions due to rotation, infall, or expansion. We find that the clump splits into six distinct cores when observed at sub-arcsecond resolution. These are identified through their 1.4 mm continuum and molecular line emission. We produce maps of the velocity, line width, and rotational temperature from the methanol and methyl cyanide lines, which allow us to investigate the cores and reveal a velocity and temperature gradient in the most massive core. We also find evidence of a bipolar outflow, possibly powered by a low-mass star. We present the tentative detection of a circumstellar self-gravitating disk lying in the most massive core and powering a large-scale outflow previously known in the literature. In our scenario, the star powering the flow is responsible for most of the luminosity of IRAS23385+6053 (~$3000~L_\odot$). The other cores, albeit with masses below the corresponding virial masses, appear to be accreting material from their molecular surroundings and are possibly collapsing or on the verge of collapse.

877,"Seismology is the main tool for inferring the deep interior structures of Earth and potentially also of other planetary bodies in the solar system. Terrestrial seismology is influenced by the presence of the ocean-generated microseismic signal, which sets a lower limit on the earthquake detection capabilities but also provides a strong energy source to infer the interior structure on scales from local to continental. Titan is the only other place in the solar system with permanent surface liquids and future lander missions there might carry a seismic package. Therefore, the presence of microseisms would be of great benefit for interior studies, but also for detecting storm-generated waves on the lakes remotely. We estimated the strength of microseismic signals on Titan, based on wind speeds predicted from modeled global circulation models interior structure. We find that storms of more than 2 m/s wind speed, would create a signal that is globally observable with a high-quality broadband sensor and observable to a thousand kilometer distance with a space-ready seismometer, such as the InSight instruments currently operating on the surface of Mars.","Simon C.

In this case, we consider the non-gravitational and phenomenological interaction between dark sectors. We fit the free parameters of the model using Pantheon Supernovae Type Ia data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Gamma-Ray burst and the the local value of the Hubble constant. We examine the THDE model to check its compatibility with observational data using objective Information Criterion (IC). We find that the THDE model cannot be supported by observational data. Using the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test we check the deviation of the model compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Surveying the evolution of squared of sound speed $v^2_s$ as an another test we check the stability of the interacting and non-interacting THDE models.

879,"Short radio pulses can be measured from showers of both high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. While commonly several antenna stations are needed to reconstruct the energy of an air shower, we describe a novel method that relies on the radio signal measured in one antenna station only. Exploiting a broad frequency bandwidth of $80-300$ MHz, we obtain a statistical energy resolution of better than 15\% on a realistic Monte Carlo set. This method is both a step towards energy reconstruction from the radio signal of neutrino induced showers, as well as a promising tool for cosmic-ray radio arrays. Especially for hybrid arrays where the air shower geometry is provided by an independent detector, this method provides a precise handle on the energy of the shower even with a sparse array.","Christoph Welling, Christian Glaser, Anna Nelles",No comment found,1905.11185v1,No journal ref found,Anna Nelles,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11185v1,2019-05-27 13:11:04+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.HE,Reconstructing the cosmic-ray energy from the radio signal measured in   one single station,2019-05-27 13:11:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11185v1

We also investigate the fundamental quasinormal mode of neutron stars under such high magnetic fields. To perform our calculations we use the chaotic field approximation and consider both nucleonic and hyperonic stars. We conclude that the role played by the constitution of the stars is far more relevant than the intensity of the magnetic field and if massive stars are considered, the ones constituted by nucleons only present frequencies somewhat lower than the ones with hyperonic cores, a feature that can be used to point out the real internal structure of neutron stars. Moreover, highly magnetized stars could only be discriminated by the fundamental mode frequency in the limiting case of magnetic field intensities of the order of 3$\times 10^{18}$ G.","Cesar V.

883,"Context. Solar outflows are a considerable source of free energy which accumulates in multiple forms like beaming (or drifting) components and/or temperature anisotropies. However, kinetic anisotropies of plasma particles do not grow indefinitely and particle-particle collisions are not efficient enough to explain the observed limits of these anisotropies. Instead, the self-generated wave instabilities can efficiently act to constrain kinetic anisotropies, but the existing approaches are simplified and do not provide satisfactory explanations. Thus, small deviations from isotropy shown by the electron temperature ($T$) in fast solar winds are not explained yet.   Aims. This paper provides an advanced quasilinear description of the whistler instability driven by the anisotropic electrons in conditions typical for the fast solar winds. The enhanced whistler-like fluctuations may constrain the upper limits of temperature anisotropy $A \equiv T_\perp /T_\parallel > 1$, where $\perp, \parallel$ are defined with respect to the magnetic field direction.   Methods. Studied are the self-generated whistler instabilities, cumulatively driven by the temperature anisotropy and the relative (counter)drift of the electron populations, e.g., core and halo electrons. Recent studies have shown that quasi-stable states are not bounded by the linear instability thresholds but an extended quasilinear approach is necessary to describe them in this case.   Results. Marginal conditions of stability are obtained from a quasilinear theory of the cumulative whistler instability, and approach the quasi-stable states of electron populations reported by the observations.The instability saturation is determined by the relaxation of both the temperature anisotropy and the relative drift of electron populations.","S.

884,"HD113337 is a Main-Sequence F6V field star more massive than the Sun, hosting one (possibly two) radial velocity (RV) giant planet(s) and a cold debris disk (marked by an infrared excess). We used the VEGA interferometer on the CHARA array to measure HD113337 angular diameter, and derived its linear radius using the Gaia parallax. We computed the bolometric flux to derive its effective temperature and luminosity, and we estimated its mass and age using evolutionary tracks. We used Herschel images to partially resolve the outer disk, and high-contrast images of HD113337 with the LBTI to probe the 10-80 au separation range. Finally, we combined the deduced contrast maps with previous RV of the star using the MESS2 software to bring upper mass limits on possible companions at all separations up to 80 au, taking advantage of the constraints on the age and inclination (brought by the fundamental parameter analysis and the disk imaging, respectively). We derive a limb-darkened angular diameter of 0.386 $\pm$ 0.009 mas that converts into a linear radius of 1.50 $\pm$ 0.04 solar radius. The fundamental parameter analysis leads to an effective temperature of 6774 $\pm$ 125 K, and to two possible age solutions: one young within 14-21 Myr and one old within 0.8-1.7 Gyr. We partially resolve the known outer debris disk and model its emission. Our best solution corresponds to a radius of 85 $\pm$ 20 au, an extension of 30 $\pm$ 20 au and an inclination within 10-30 degrees for the outer disk. The combination of imaging contrast limits, published RV, and our new age and inclination solutions leads to a first possible estimation of the true masses of the planetary companions: $\sim 7_{-2}^{+4}$ Jupiter masses for HD113337 b (confirmed companion), and $\sim 16_{-3}^{+10}$ Jupiter masses for HD113337 c (candidate).

885,"In the era of radio astronomy, the high sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could play a decisive role in the detection of new radio sources. In particular, synchrotron radio emission from electrons and positrons produced by the annihilation of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) in dark matter halos may be helpful in revealing the elusive nature of dark matter. In this work we study the SKA sensitivity for synchrotron radio emission from multi-TeV dark matter candidates annihilating in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Firstly, we analyse the SKA sensitivity for model-independent dark matter. We show that the upper limit of detectability lies close to 10 TeV for $W^+W^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$ and $t\overline{t}$ channels after 1000 hours. This limit is displaced to masses even higher than 100 TeV when the enhancement due to an intermediate massive black hole is considered. Secondly, we focus on some specific masses that may fit either the cut-off in the gamma-ray spectra observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) from the J1745-290 Galactic Centre source or the recent Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)-02 positron fraction. Finally, we consider extra-dimensional brane-world theories whose fluctuations, dubbed branons, represent a natural candidate for WIMPs. In this specific scenario, we set constraints on the branons parameter space (f,M), being f the coupling of the branon to the Standard Model particles and M the mass of the branon itself.

887,"Collisional charging is one potential initial step in generating lightning. In this work, we study the charging of colliding monodisperse, spherical basalt grains depending on ambient pressure. We used grains of 1.0 to 1.2 mm in one set and 2.0 to 2.4 mm in another set. We varied the ambient pressure between 0.03 mbar and 80 mbar. This especially includes Martian pressure being 6 mbar on average. At a few mbar the net charge gathering on colliding grains has a minimum. A smooth incline in charging occurs for larger pressures. Toward lower pressure the charge increases steeply. The pressure dependence is in agreement to a model where the maximum charge is limited by a gas discharge occurring between two charged colliding grains shortly after or before a collision. The capability of building up charge is at a minimum exactly in the range of Martian pressures. The charges on grains are at least a factor 5 smaller than at the highest pressure tested and still smaller compared to ambient pressure on Earth. This implies that on Mars collisional charging and the potential of subsequent generation of lightning or other large scale discharges are strongly reduced compared to Earth. This might result in less frequent and less energetic lightning on Mars.","Gerhard Wurm, Lars Schmidt, Tobias Steinpilz, Lucia Boden, Jens Teiser",No comment found,1905.11138v1,No journal ref found,Jens Teiser,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11138v1,2019-05-27 11:37:47+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|physics.ao-ph,A challenge for Martian lightning: Limits of collisional charging at low   pressure,2019-05-27 11:37:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11138v1

Optical counterparts are identified as peaks in galaxy richness as a function of redshift along the line of sight toward each 2RXS source within a search region informed by an X-ray prior. All peaks are assigned a probability \fcont\ of being a random superposition. The clusters lie at $0.02<z<1.1$ with more than 100 clusters at $z>0.5$. Residual contamination is 2.6\% and 9.6\% for the cuts adopted here.

Comparison with other catalogs (MCXC, RM, SPT-SZ, Planck) is performed to test consistency of richness, luminosity and mass estimates. We measure the MARD-Y3 X-ray luminosity function and compare it to the expectation from a fiducial cosmology and externally calibrated luminosity- and richness-mass relations.

890,"Observations of various molecular lines toward a disk region of a nearby galaxy are now feasible, and they are being employed as diagnostic tools to study star-formation activities there. However, the spatial resolution attainable for a nearby galaxy with currently available radio telescopes is $10-1000$ pc, which is much larger than the scales of individual star-forming regions and molecular cloud cores. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to elucidate which part of an interstellar medium such spatially-unresolved observations are tracing. Here we present sensitive measurements of the H$_2$CO ($1_{01}-0_{00}$) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the spiral arm of M51 using the NRO 45 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes. In conjunction with the previously observed H$_2$CO ($2_{02}-1_{01}$) and CS ($2-1$ and $3-2$) lines, we derive the H$_2$ density of the emitting regions to be $(0.6-2.6)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $(2.9-12)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ for H$_2$CO and CS, respectively, by the non-LTE analyses, where we assume the source size of $0.8-1$ kpc and the gas kinetic temperature of $10-20$ K. The derived H$_2$ density indicates that the emission of H$_2$CO and CS is not localized to star-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire region of GMCs. Such widespread distributions of H$_2$CO and CS are also supported by models assuming lognormal density distributions over the 1 kpc region. Thus, contributions from the widespread less-dense components should be taken into account for interpretation of these molecular emission observed with a GMC-scale resolution. The different H$_2$ densities derived for H$_2$CO and CS imply their different distributions. We discuss this differences in terms of the formation processes of H$_2$CO and CS.","Yuri Nishimura, Yoshimasa Watanabe, Nanase Harada, Kotaro Kohno, Satoshi Yamamoto","12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.11087v1,No journal ref found,Satoshi Yamamoto,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11087v1,2019-05-27 09:53:52+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Molecular Gas Density Measured with H$_2$CO and CS toward a Spiral Arm   of M51,2019-05-27 09:53:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11087v1

The total molecular gas mass obtained with a standard Milky-Way CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor is $(5.62 \pm 0.53)\times10^8$ M$_\odot$, which is consistent with previous studies. The disturbed velocity field of the molecular gas suggests that the molecular gas is injected very recently ($<1$ Gyr) if it has an external origin and is in the process of settling into a rotating disk. Assuming that a low-mass gas-rich galaxy has accreted, the gas-to-dust ratio and H$_2$-to-HI ratio are unusually low ($\sim 28$) and high ($\sim 5.6$), respectively. To explain these ratios, additional processes should be taken into accounts such as an effective dust formation and conversion from atomic to molecular gas during the interaction.

892,"Measuring Venus' atmospheric circulation at different altitudes is important for understanding its complex dynamics, in particular the mechanisms driving the super-rotation. Observationally, Doppler imaging spectroscopy is in principle be the most reliable way to measure wind speeds of planetary atmospheres because it directly provides the projected speed of atmospheric particles. However, high-resolution imaging-spectroscopy is challenging, especially in the visible domain, and most of the knowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained with cloud-tracking technique. The objective of the present work is to measure the global properties of Venus' atmospheric dynamics at the altitude of the uppermost clouds, which is probed by reflected solar lines in the visible domain. Our results are based on high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the long slit spectrometer of the solar telescope THEMIS. We present the first instantaneous ""radial-velocity snapshot"" of any planet of the solar system in the visible domain, i.e., a complete RV map of the planet obtained by stacking data on less than 10% of its rotation period. From this, we measure the properties of the zonal and meridional winds, which we unambiguously detect. We identify a wind circulation pattern that significantly differs from previous knowledge about Venus. The zonal wind displays a ""hot spot"" structure, featuring about 200 m/s at sunrise and 70 m/s at noon in the equatorial region. Regarding meridional winds, we detect an equator-to-pole meridional flow peaking at 45 m/s at mid latitudes, i.e., which is about twice as large as what was reported so far.","Patrick Gaulme, Francois-Xavier Schmider, Thomas Widemann, Ivan Goncalves, Arturo Lopez Ariste, Bernard Gelly","Accepted in A&A, 23 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables",1905.11078v1,No journal ref found,Bernard Gelly,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11078v1,2019-05-27 09:29:55+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.IM,Atmospheric circulation of Venus measured with visible   imaging-spectroscopy at the THEMIS observatory,2019-05-27 09:29:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11078v1
893,"The fact that infrared ring nebulae (IRRNs) are frequently associated with HII regions, provides us the opportunity to study dust at the interface between ionized and neutral gas. In this paper, we analyze the infrared radiation in the range from 8 to 500~$\mu$m in outer and inner parts of 32 IRRNs showing round shape. We aim to determine the morphology of these objects and possible dust evolution processes on the base of the comparison of IR radiation towards the ionized and neutral regions. We calculate six slopes between adjacent wavelengths in their spectral energy distributions to trace the difference in the physical conditions inside and outside ionized regions. Using the data on these 32 objects we show that their morphology is likely 3D spherical rather than 2D plane-like. The slope between 70 and 160~$\mu$m is the most appropriate tracer of the dust temperature in the outer envelope. The larger 8-to-24~$\mu$m intensity ratio is associated with smaller intensities at mid-IR indicating that the PAHs may indeed be generated due to larger grain destruction. These data are important for the subsequent theoretical modeling and determining the dust evolution in HII regions and their envelopes.","A. P. Topchieva, V. V. Akimkin, G. V.

894,"We present a string-based picture of the cosmological evolution in which (CP-violating) gravitational anomalies acting during the inflationary phase of the universe cause the vacuum energy density to ""run"" with the effective Hubble parameter squared, $H^2$, thanks to the axion field of the bosonic string multiplet. This leads to baryogenesis through leptogenesis with massive right-handed neutrinos. The generation of chiral matter after inflation helps in cancelling the anomalies in the observable radiation- and matter- dominated eras. The present era inherits the same ""running vacuum"" structure triggered during the inflationary time by the axion field. The current dark energy is thus predicted to be mildly dynamical, and dark matter should be made of axions.

895,"Ten binary black-hole mergers have already been detected during the first two observing runs of advanced LIGO and Virgo, and many more are expected to be observed in the near future. This opens the possibility for gravitational-wave astronomy to better constrain the properties of black hole binaries, not only as single sources, but as a whole astrophysical population. In this paper, we address the problem of using gravitational-wave measurements to estimate the proportion of merging black holes produced either via isolated binaries or binaries evolving in young star clusters. To this end, we use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach applied to catalogs of merging binary black holes generated using state-of-the-art population synthesis and N-body codes. In particular, we show that, although current advanced LIGO/Virgo observations only mildly constrain the mixing fraction $f \in [0,1]$ between the two formation channels, we expect to narrow down the fractional errors on $f$ to $10-20\%$ after a few hundreds of detections.","Yann Bouffanais, Michela Mapelli, Davide Gerosa, Ugo N.

896,"We present new ALMA observations of the molecular gas and far-infrared continuum around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the cool-core cluster MACS 1931.8-2635. Our observations reveal $1.9 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas, on par with the largest known reservoirs of cold gas in a cluster core. We detect CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and CO(4-3) emission from both diffuse and compact molecular gas components that extend from the BCG center out to $\sim30$ kpc to the northwest, tracing the UV knots and H$\alpha$ filaments observed by HST. Due to the lack of morphological symmetry, we hypothesize that the $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity of the CO in the tail is not due to concurrent uplift by AGN jets, rather we may be observing the aftermath of a recent AGN outburst. The CO spectral line energy distribution suggests that molecular gas excitation is influenced by processes related to both star formation and recent AGN feedback. Continuum emission in Bands 6 and 7 arises from dust and is spatially coincident with young stars and nebular emission observed in the UV and optical. We constrain the temperature of several dust clumps to be $\lesssim 10$ K, which is too cold to be directly interacting with the surrounding $\sim 4.8$ keV intracluster medium (ICM). The cold dust population extends beyond the observed CO emission and must either be protected from interacting with the ICM or be surrounded by local volumes of ICM that are several keV colder than observed by Chandra.","Kevin Fogarty, Marc Postman, Yuan Li, Helmut Dannerbauer, Hauyu Baobab Liu, Megan Donahue, Bodo Ziegler, Anton Koekemoer, Brenda Frye","Accepted for Publication in ApJ, 19 pages, 11 figures.

897,"We study the morphological transformation from late types to early types and the quenching of galaxies with the seventh Data Release (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Both early type galaxies and late type galaxies are found to have bimodal distributions on the star formation rate versus stellar mass diagram ($\lg SFR - \lg M_*$). We therefore classify them into four types: the star-forming early types (sEs), the quenched early types (qEs), the star-forming late types (sLs) and the quenched late types (qLs). We checked many parameters on various environmental scales for their potential effects on the quenching rates of late types and early types, as well as the early type fractions among star-forming galaxies and those among quenched galaxies. These parameters include: the stellar mass $M_*$, and the halo mass $M_{halo}$; the small-scale environmental parameters, such as the halo centric radius $R_p/r_{180}$ and the third nearest neighbor distances ($d_{3nn}$); the large-scale environmental parameters, specifically whether they are located in clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. We found that the morphological transformation is mainly regulated by the stellar mass. Quenching is mainly driven by the stellar mass for more massive galaxies and by the halo mass for galaxies with smaller stellar masses. In addition, we see an overall stronger halo quenching effect in early type galaxies, which might be attributed to their lacking of cold gas or earlier accretion into the massive host halos.","Chenxu Liu, Lei Hao, Huiyuan Wang, Xiaohu Yang","ApJ accepted, 13 pages, 14 figures",1905.11008v1,No journal ref found,Xiaohu Yang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11008v1,2019-05-27 07:12:08+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,The morphological transformation and the quenching of galaxies,2019-05-27 07:12:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11008v1
898,"Cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations have yielded several notable excesses that often lend themselves to explanation by various dark matter annihilation/decay models. In particular, the AMS-02 anti-proton and positron excesses have continued to grow more robust with the collection of more data. This is supplemented by gamma-ray excesses in the Galactic Centre and a high-energy break in spectrum of electron/positron cosmic rays seen by DAMPE. In this work we carefully model the magnetic field environments of M31 and M33 and use this to estimate expected synchrotron emissions from electrons produced via dark matter annihilation. By comparing this to available radio data we review simplifying assumptions used previously for dark matter hunting in these environments and produce novel constraints that are capable of fully ruling out dark matter models proposed to accommodate all the aforementioned excesses barring that of DAMPE. However, we do show that significant constraints can be placed upon the DAMPE parameter space with M31 data. In addition to this we project SKA non-observation constraints for the Reticulum II and Triangulum II dwarf galaxies and find these have potential to rule out cosmic-ray and gamma-ray excess-producing models of dark matter, even when the most conservative assumptions are employed.",Geoff Beck,19 pages. 13 figures. 1 table.

899,"The parameters of the original log-normal mass spectrum of primordial black holes (PBH) are adjusted based on the existing observational data on supermassive black holes in the galactic centers and the mass distribution of the near-solar mass black holes in the Galaxy. Together with the assumption that PBHs make all or a large mass fraction of the cosmological dark matter it allows to fix the parameters of the original mass spectrum. The predicted, in this way, number density of MACHOs is found to be about an order of magnitude below the observed value. Possible resolution of the controversy may be prescribed to non-isotropic and inhomogeneous distribution of MACHOs or to the two-maximum spectra of PBH.","A. D. Dolgov, S.

900,"We study a model of two scalar fields with a hyperbolic field space and show that it reduces to a single-field Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) model in the limit where the field space becomes infinitely curved. We apply the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the two-field model and take the same limit. It is shown that in the limit, all quantities appearing in the swampland conjecture remain well-defined within the single-field DBI model. Based on a consistency argument, we then speculate that the condition derived in this way can be considered as the de Sitter swampland conjecture for a DBI scalar field by its own. The condition differs from those proposed in the literature and only the one in the present paper passes the consistency argument. As a byproduct, we also point out that one of the inequalities in the swampland conjecture for a multi-field model with linear kinetic terms should involve the lowest mass squared for scalar perturbations and that this quantity can be significantly different from the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian of the potential in the local orthonormal frame if the field space is highly curved. Finally, we propose an extension of the de Sitter swampland conjecture to a more general scalar field with the Lagrangian of the form $P(X,\varphi)$, where $X=-(\partial\varphi)^2/2$.","Shuntaro Mizuno, Shinji Mukohyama, Shi Pi, Yun-Long Zhang","12 pages, 4 figures",1905.10950v1,No journal ref found,Yun-Long Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10950v1,2019-05-27 03:11:25+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph,Hyperbolic field space and swampland conjecture for DBI scalar,2019-05-27 03:11:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10950v1

Large-scale spectroscopic surveys, such as APOGEE/APOGEE-2, now have sufficient radial velocity precision to directly confirm the signature of giant exoplanets, making such data sets valuable tools in the TESS era.

902,"We report results from joint NuSTAR, Swift and XMM-Newton observations of the newly discovered black hole X-ray binary candidate Swift J1658.2-4242 in the intermediate state. We observe a peculiar event in this source, with its X-ray flux rapidly decreasing by $\sim$45\% in $\sim$40~s, accompanied by only subtle changes in the shape of the broadband X-ray spectrum. In addition, we find a sudden turn-on of a transient QPO with a frequency of $6-7$~Hz around the time of the flux change, and the total fractional rms amplitude of the power spectrum increases from $\sim$2\% to $\sim$10\%. X-ray spectral and timing analyses indicate that the flux decrease is driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion flow around the black hole, rather than intervening material along the line of sight. In addition, we do not significantly detect any relativistic disk reflection component, indicating it is much weaker than previously observed while the source was in the bright hard state. We propose accretion disk instabilities triggered at a large disk radius as the origin of the fast transition in spectral and timing properties, and discuss possible causes of the unusual properties observed in Swift J1658.2-4242. The prompt flux variation detected along with the emergence of a QPO makes the event an interesting case for investigating QPO mechanisms in black hole X-ray binaries.","Yanjun Xu, Fiona A.

903,"We present an analytic approach to lift the mass-anisotropy degeneracy in clusters of galaxies by utilizing the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of clustered galaxies jointly with weak lensing inferred masses. More specifically, we solve the spherical Jeans equation by assuming a simple relation between the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the radial velocity dispersion and recast the Jeans equation as a Bernoulli differential equation that has a well-known analytic solution. We first test our method in cosmological N-body simulations and then derive the anisotropy profiles for 35 archival data galaxy clusters with an average redshift of $\langle {z}_{c}\rangle =0.25$. The resulting profiles yield a weighted average global value of $\langle \beta (0.2\leqslant R/{R}_{200}\leqslant 1)\rangle =0.35\pm 0.28$ (stat) \pm 0.15 (sys). This indicates that clustered galaxies tend to globally fall on radially anisotropic orbits.

904,"In this paper, we propose a new test to the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), $D_L=D_A(1+z)^2$, where $D_L$ and $D_A$ are the luminosity and angular diameter distances, respectively. The data used correspond to 61 Type Ia Supernova luminosity distances and $Y_{SZE}-Y_X$ measurements of 61 galaxy clusters obtained by the {\it Planck} mission and the deep XMM-Newton X-ray data, where $Y_{SZE}$ is the integrated comptonization parameter obtained via Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations and $Y_X$ is the X-ray counterpart. More precisely, we use the $Y_{SZE}D_{A}^{2}/C_{XSZE}Y_X$ scaling-relation and a deformed CDDR, such as $D_L/D_A(1+z)^2=\eta(z)$, to verify if $\eta(z)$ is compatible with the unity.

906,"The appearance of scalar/moduli fields in the early universe, as motivated by string theory, naturally leads to non-thermal ""moduli cosmology"". Such cosmology provides a consistent framework where the generation of radiation, baryons, and dark matter can occur while maintaining successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and avoiding the cosmological moduli problem. We present a relatively economical construction with moduli cosmology, building on a variety of string-inspired components (e.g. supersymmetry, discrete symmetries, Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation). We address a range of outstanding problems of particle physics and cosmology simultaneously, including the fermion mass hierarchy and flavor puzzle, the smallness of neutrino masses, baryogenesis and dark matter. Our setup, based on discrete $\mathrm{Z}_{12}^{R}$ symmetry and anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$, is void of the usual issues plaguing the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, i.e. the $\mu$-problem and the overly-rapid proton decay due to dimension-4,-5 operators. The model is compatible with $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ Grand Unification. The smallness of Dirac neutrino masses is automatically established by requiring the cancellation of mixed gravitational-gauge anomalies. The decay of the moduli field provides a common origin for the baryon number and dark matter abundance, explaining the observed cosmic coincidences, $\Omega_{B} \sim \Omega_{DM}$.","Mu-Chun Chen, Volodymyr Takhistov",26 pages; v2: published version,1812.09341v2,No journal ref found,Volodymyr Takhistov,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09341v2,2018-12-21 19:15:07+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-th,"Baryogenesis, Dark Matter, and Flavor Structure in Non-thermal Moduli   Cosmology",2019-05-26 19:45:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09341v2
907,"We use galaxy dynamical information to calibrate the richness-mass scaling relation of a sample of 428 galaxy clusters that are members of the CODEX sample with redshifts up to z~0.7. These clusters were X-ray selected using the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), cross-matched to associated systems in the redMaPPer catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The spectroscopic sample we analyze was obtained in the SPIDERS program and contains ~7800 red member galaxies. Adopting NFW mass and galaxy density profiles and a broad range of orbital anisotropy profiles, we use the Jeans equation to calculate halo masses. Modeling the scaling relation as $\lambda \propto \text{A}_{\lambda} {M_{\text{200c}}}^{\text{B}_{\lambda}} ({1+z})^{\gamma_{\lambda}}$, we find the parameter constraints $\text{A}_{\lambda}=38.6^{+3.1}_{-4.1}\pm3.9$, $\text{B}_{\lambda}=0.99^{+0.06}_{-0.07}\pm0.04$, and $\gamma_{\lambda}=-1.13^{+0.32}_{-0.34}\pm0.49$. We find good agreement with previously published mass trends with the exception of those from stacked weak lensing analyses. We note that although the lensing analyses failed to account for the Eddington bias, this is not enough to explain the differences. We suggest that differences in the levels of contamination between pure redMaPPer and RASS+redMaPPer samples could well contribute to these differences. The redshift trend we measure is more negative than but statistically consistent with previous results. We suggest that our measured redshift trend reflects a change in the cluster galaxy red sequence fraction with redshift, noting that the trend we measure is consistent with but somewhat stronger than an independently measured redshift trend in the red sequence fraction. We also examine the impact of a plausible model of correlated scatter in X-ray luminosity and optical richness, showing it has negligible impact on our results.","R. Capasso, J. J. Mohr, A. Saro, A.

908,"We propose a non-parametric method to denoise 1D stellar spectra based on wavelet shrinkage followed by adaptive Kalman thresholding. Wavelet shrinkage denoising involves applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the input signal, `shrinking' certain frequency components in the transform domain, and then applying inverse DWT to the reduced components. The performance of this procedure is influenced by the choice of base wavelet, the number of decomposition levels, and the thresholding function. Typically, these parameters are chosen by `trial and error', which can be strongly dependent on the properties of the data being denoised. We here introduce an adaptive Kalman-filter-based thresholding method that eliminates the need for choosing the number of decomposition levels. We use the `Haar' wavelet basis, which we found to be the best-suited for 1D stellar spectra. We introduce various levels of Poisson noise into synthetic PHOENIX spectra, and test the performance of several common denoising methods against our own. It proves superior in terms of noise suppression and peak shape preservation. We expect it may also be of use in automatically and accurately filtering low signal-to-noise galaxy and quasar spectra obtained from surveys such as SDSS, Gaia, LSST, PESSTO, VANDELS, LEGA-C, and DESI.","Sankalp Gilda, Zachary Slepian","19 pages, 2 appendices, 17 figures.

Unlike the Schutz's distribution \citep{Schutz2011} which represents inclinations as measured from GW detections alone, the distribution of multimessenger detections will depend also on the intrinsic SGRB properties such as the jet structure, energy, and jet opening angle \textit{etc}. We demonstrate this using a simulated population of joint BNS-SGRB events and also discuss their possible consequences - the detection rates and distance reaches of low and high inclination angle events in the current and future network configurations of GW detectors alongside Fermi GBM as the representative $\gamma-$ray detection facility. Assuming all the BNS mergers to have SGRB counterparts with Gaussian structured jets whose properties are similar to as inferred for GRB170817A, we find that at lower inclination angles (say below 20$^\circ$), the distance reaches as well as the detection rates of the joint BNS-SGRB detections are limited by the sensitivity of GW detectors while at larger inclinations (say above 20$^\circ$), they are limited by the sensitivity of $\gamma$-ray instruments.",M.

911,"We have been developing a monolithic active pixel sensor, ``XRPIX``, for the Japan led future X-ray astronomy mission ``FORCE`` observing the X-ray sky in the energy band of 1-80 keV with angular resolution of better than 15``. XRPIX is an upper part of a stack of two sensors of an imager system onboard FORCE, and covers the X-ray energy band lower than 20 keV. The XRPIX device consists of a fully depleted high-resistivity silicon sensor layer for X-ray detection, a low resistivity silicon layer for CMOS readout circuit, and a buried oxide layer in between, which is fabricated with 0.2 $\mu$ m CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. Each pixel has a trigger circuit with which we can achieve a 10 $\mu$ s time resolution, a few orders of magnitude higher than that with X-ray astronomy CCDs. We recently introduced a new type of a device structure, a pinned depleted diode (PDD), in the XRPIX device, and succeeded in improving the spectral performance, especially in a readout mode using the trigger function. In this paper, we apply a mesh experiment to the XRPIX devices for the first time in order to study the spectral response of the PDD device at the subpixel resolution. We confirmed that the PDD structure solves the significant degradation of the charge collection efficiency at the pixel boundaries and in the region under the pixel circuits, which is found in the single SOI structure, the conventional type of the device structure. On the other hand, the spectral line profiles are skewed with low energy tails and the line peaks slightly shift near the pixel boundaries, which contribute to a degradation of the energy resolution.","Kazuho Kayama, Takeshi G.

912,"Magnetic Penrose process (MPP) is not only the most exciting and fascinating process mining the rotational energy of black hole but it is also the favored astrophysically viable mechanism for high energy sources and phenomena. It operates in three regimes of efficiency, namely low, moderate and ultra, depending on the magnetization and charging of spinning black holes in astrophysical setting. In this paper, we revisit MPP with a comprehensive discussion of its physics in different regimes, and compare its operation with other competing mechanisms. We show that MPP could in principle foot the bill for powering engine of such phenomena as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, relativistic jets, fast radio bursts, quasars, AGNs, etc. Further, it also leads to a number of important observable predictions. All this beautifully bears out the promise of a new vista of energy powerhouse heralded by Roger Penrose half a century ago through this process, and it has today risen in its magnetically empowered version of mid 1980s from a purely thought experiment of academic interest to a realistic powering mechanism for various high-energy astrophysical phenomena.","Arman Tursunov, Naresh Dadhich","25 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; published version, some references

913,"The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known presently on galaxies belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, and on the properties of the filaments themselves. We investigate here the properties of the rich cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745 and its extended filament, by analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in the core of this cluster and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament to better constrain the filament properties. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope archive data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL is determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs are extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations in the filaments are estimated with SExtractor after correction for the Point Spread Function. We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though quite noisy, the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region that was analyzed.","A. Ellien, F. Durret, C. Adami, N. Martinet, C. Lobo, M.

914,"Recent observations support the propagation of a number of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes which, under some conditions, can become unstable and the developing instability is the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability (KHI). In its nonlinear stage the KHI can trigger the occurrence of wave turbulence which is considered as a candidate mechanism for coronal heating. We review the modeling of tornado-like phenomena in the solar chromosphere and corona as moving weakly twisted and spinning cylindrical flux tubes, showing that the KHI rises at the excitation of high-mode MHD waves. The instability occurs within a wavenumber range whose width depends on the MHD mode number \emph{m}, the plasma density contrast between the rotating jet and its environment, and also on the twists of the internal magnetic field and the jet velocity. We have studied KHI in two twisted spinning solar polar coronal hole jets, in a twisted rotating jet emerging from a filament eruption, and in a rotating macrospicule. The theoretically calculated KHI development times of a few minutes for wavelengths comparable to the half-widths of the jets are in good agreement with the observationally determined growth times only for high order (10 $\mathrm{\leqslant}$ \emph{m} $\mathrm{\leqslant}$ 65) MHD modes. Therefore, we expect that the observed KHI in these cases is due to unstable high-order MHD modes.","Ivan Zhelyazkov, Ramesh Chandra, Reetika Joshi","26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table",1905.10789v1,No journal ref found,Reetika Joshi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10789v1,2019-05-26 11:57:52+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,How Rotating Solar Atmospheric Jets Become Kelvin--Helmholtz Unstable,2019-05-26 11:57:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10789v1

The results are in very good agreement with those previously published using the traditional methodology. The probabilistic programming library PyMC3 was chosen to explore the parameter space via a NUTs sampler. These machine learning tools provided excellent convergence quality and speed.

916,"White dwarfs are the remnants of low and intermediate mass stars. Because of electron degeneracy, their evolution is just a simple gravothermal process of cooling. Recently, thanks to Gaia data, it has been possible to construct the luminosity function of massive (0.9 < M/Msun < 1.1) white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (d < 100 pc). Since the lifetime of their progenitors is very short, the birth times of both, parents and daughters, are very close and allow to reconstruct the (effective) star formation rate. This rate started growing from zero during the early Galaxy and reached a maximum 6-7 Gyr ago. It declined and ~5 Gyr ago started to climb once more reaching a maximum 2 - 3 Gyr in the past and decreased since then.

920,"In this work, we investigate the reason behind the increased occurrence of S0 galaxies in high density environments. Our sample comprises of $\sim$ 2500 spiral and $\sim$ 2000 S0 galaxies spanning a wide range of environments. Dividing the galaxies into categories of classical and pseudobulge hosting spiral and S0 galaxies, we have studied their properties as a function of the environment. We find that the fraction of pseudobulge hosting disc galaxies decreases with increase in density. The classical bulge hosting spirals and S0 galaxies follow a similar trend in less dense environments but towards higher densities, we observe an increase in the fraction of classical bulge host S0 galaxies at the expense of spirals. Comparing the structural and the star formation properties of galaxies on the size-mass and $NUV-r$ colour-mass planes respectively, we infer that classical bulge hosting spirals are likely to get transformed into S0 morphology. We notice a trend of galaxy structure with environment such that the fraction of classical bulge hosting spiral galaxies is found to increase with environment density. We also find that among classical bulge hosting spirals, the fraction of quenched galaxies increases in denser environments. We surmise that the existence of more classical bulge hosting spirals galaxies and more efficient quenching leads to the observed increased occurrence of S0 galaxies in high density environments. The relation between galaxy structure and environment also exists for the disc galaxies irrespective of their visual morphology, which is driven mainly by halo mass.","Preetish K.

921,"Imaging the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and extracting a BH-spin signature is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics. M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging the BH shadow and it can be partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly in a flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about influences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of the SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent increase with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected to appear in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the quiescent states. We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical image by assuming the current and future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array, and have found that the future EHT including space-very long baseline interferometry in 2020s can detect the dark crescent.","Tomohisa Kawashima, Motoki Kino, Kazunori Akiyama","12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.10717v1,No journal ref found,Kazunori Akiyama,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10717v1,2019-05-26 03:10:15+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Black Hole Spin Signature in the Black Hole Shadow of M87 in the Flaring   State,2019-05-26 03:10:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10717v1

923,"We present hybrid-Vlasov--Maxwell simulations of magnetized plasma turbulence including non-linear electron-inertia effects in a generalized Ohm's law. When fluctuation energy is directly injected on a wide range of scales that include those near the ion-kinetic scales, the ions efficiently become de-magnetized around rapidly forming electron-scale current sheets. These are the current sheets where electron-only reconnection efficiently occurs. We show that these electron-only reconnection events are characterized by electron jets unaccompanied by ion outflows, similar to those found in recent MMS measurements reported in Phan et al. (2018) that were taken in the Earth's turbulent magnetosheath downstream of the bow shock. We also demonstrate that the physics of reconnection within these current sheets and the accompanying turbulent dynamics at sub-ion scales is consistent with an electron-magnetohydrodynamic description. We conjecture that this kind of turbulent regime may be found in systems where plasma processes, such as velocity-space instabilities and/or shocks, modify the cascade by injecting energy close to the ion-kinetic scales.","F.

Here we aim to measure the masses of the known transiting planets in this system using precise radial velocity (RV) measurements taken with the HARPS spectrograph. We consider both trained and untrained Gaussian process regression models of stellar activity to simultaneously model the RV data with the planetary signals. Our RV analysis is then supplemented with dynamical simulations to provide strong constraints on the planets' orbital eccentricities by requiring long-term stability. We measure the planet masses of the two outermost planets to be $2.46\pm 0.31$ and $2.26\pm 0.50$ Earth masses which confirms their bulk terrestrial compositions. We are able to place an upper limit on the mass of the smallest, innermost planet of $<0.98$ Earth masses with 95% confidence. Our RV plus dynamical stability analysis places strong constraints on the orbital eccentricities and reveals that each planet's orbit likely has $e<0.1$ to ensure a dynamically stable system. The L 98-59 compact system of three likely rocky planets offers a unique laboratory for studies of planet formation, dynamical stability, and comparative atmospheric planetology.

925,"To date, different alternative theories of gravity involving Proca fields have been proposed. Unfortunately, the procedure to obtain the relevant terms in some formulations has not been systematic or exhaustive, thus resulting in some missing terms or ambiguity in the process carried out. In this paper, we propose a systematic procedure to build the beyond generalized theory for a Proca field in four dimensions containing only the field itself and its first-order derivatives. In our approach, we employ all the possible Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian pieces made of the Proca field and its first-order derivatives, including those that violate parity, and find the relevant combination that propagates only three degrees of freedom and has healthy dynamics for the longitudinal mode. The key step in our procedure is to retain the flat space-time divergences of the currents in the theory during the covariantization process. In the curved space-time theory, some of the retained terms are no longer current divergences so that they induce the new terms that identify the beyond generalized Proca field theory. The procedure constitutes a systematic method to build general theories for multiple vector fields with or without internal symmetries.","Alexander Gallego Cadavid, Yeinzon Rodriguez","LaTeX file in RevTeX 4.1 style, 11 pages in single column, no figures",1905.10664v1,No journal ref found,Yeinzon Rodriguez,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10664v1,2019-05-25 19:46:05+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,A systematic procedure to build the beyond generalized Proca field   theory,2019-05-25 19:46:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10664v1

927,"Machine learning is now used in many areas of astrophysics, from detecting exoplanets in Kepler transit signals to removing telescope systematics. Recent work demonstrated the potential of using machine learning algorithms for atmospheric retrieval by implementing a random forest to perform retrievals in seconds that are consistent with the traditional, computationally-expensive nested-sampling retrieval method. We expand upon their approach by presenting a new machine learning model, \texttt{plan-net}, based on an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks that yields more accurate inferences than the random forest for the same data set of synthetic transmission spectra. We demonstrate that an ensemble provides greater accuracy and more robust uncertainties than a single model. In addition to being the first to use Bayesian neural networks for atmospheric retrieval, we also introduce a new loss function for Bayesian neural networks that learns correlations between the model outputs. Importantly, we show that designing machine learning models to explicitly incorporate domain-specific knowledge both improves performance and provides additional insight by inferring the covariance of the retrieved atmospheric parameters. We apply \texttt{plan-net} to the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 transmission spectrum for WASP-12b and retrieve an isothermal temperature and water abundance consistent with the literature. We highlight that our method is flexible and can be expanded to higher-resolution spectra and a larger number of atmospheric parameters.","Adam D. Cobb, Michael D.

Moreover, when these two time-stretched light curves, $(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$, overlap each other, $(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(B-V)_0$ do too, where $(B-V)_0$ is the intrinsic $B-V$ color. Thus, the two nova tracks overlap each other in the $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ diagram. Inversely using these properties, we obtain/confirm the distance and reddening by comparing each nova light/color curves with the well calibrated template novae. We classify the 32 novae into two types, LV Vul and V1500 Cyg types, in the time-stretched $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ color-magnitude diagram. The WD mass is obtained by direct comparison of the model $V$ light curves with the observation. Thus, we obtain a uniform set of 32 galactic classical novae that provides the distances and WD masses from a single method. Many novae broadly follow the universal decline law and the present method can be applied to them, while some novae largely deviate from the universal decline law and so the method cannot be directly applied to them. We discuss such examples.","Izumi Hachisu, Mariko Kato","175 pages including 126 figures, to appear in ApJS",1905.10655v1,No journal ref found,Mariko Kato,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10655v1,2019-05-25 19:00:39+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,A Light Curve Analysis of 32 Recent Galactic Novae --- Distances and   White Dwarf Masses,2019-05-25 19:00:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10655v1
929,"We drew attention to the analogy between the round-the-world seismic echo on the Earth and on the Sun. The phenomenon of echo on the Earth is observed during earthquakes. It was found that the main shock of earthquake excites a circular surface wave, which having rounded the Earth returns to the epicenter and stimulates a repeated earthquake (aftershock) 3 hours after the main shock. Apparently, something similar happens on the Sun during a chromospheric flare. We found signs of a small increase in flare brightness approximately one hour after reaching maximum brightness. The phenomenon is explained by the fact that the converging surface wave, which has returned to the epicenter after the round-the-world trip, has a definite impact on the flare area.

930,"Tau neutrinos with energies in the PeV-EeV range produce up-going extensive air showers (UEAS) if they interact underground close enough to the surface of the Earth. This work studies detectability of the UEAS with a system of fluorescence telescopes overlooking dark, low reflectivity, area on the ground up to the distances 20-30 km from mountain top(s). Such system could provide sensitivity sufficient for accumulation of the astrophysical neutrino signal statistics at the rate ten(s) events per year in the energy range beyond 10 PeV, thus allowing to extend the energy frontier of neutrino astronomy into 10-100 PeV range. Comparison of sensitivities of the top-of-the-mountain telescope and IceCube Generation II shows that the two approaches for neutrino detection are complementary, providing comparable performance in adjacent energy bands below and above 10~PeV. Sensitivity of the top-of-the-mountain fluorescence telescope system is also sufficient for the discovery of theoretically predicted cosmogenic neutrino signal.",A.

931,"We study implications of the very recently reported mass $M=2.17^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$M$_\odot$ of PSR~J0740+6620 on the Equation of State (EOS) of super-dense neutron-rich nuclear matter with respect to existing constraints on the EOS based on the mass $M=2.01\pm 0.04$M$_\odot$ of PSR~J0348+0432, the maximum tidal deformability of GW170817 and earlier results of various terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments. The lower limit of the skewness $J_0$ measuring the stiffness of super-dense isospin-symmetric nuclear matter is raised raised from about -220 MeV to -150 MeV, reducing significantly its current uncertainty range. The lower bound of the high-density symmetry energy also increases appreciably leading to a rise of the minimum proton fraction in neutron stars at $\beta$-equilibrium from about 0 to 5\% around three times the saturation density of nuclear matter. The difficulties for some of the most widely used and previously well tested model EOSs to predict simultaneously both a maximum mass higher than 2.17 M$_\odot$ and a pressure consistent with that extracted from GW170817 present some interesting new challenges for nuclear theories.","Nai-Bo Zhang, Bao-An Li","Discussions and references added.

932,"We present an Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo search for sub-solar mass ultracompact objects in data obtained during Advanced LIGO's second observing run. In contrast to a previous search of Advanced LIGO data from the first observing run, this search includes the effects of component spin on the gravitational waveform. We identify no viable gravitational wave candidates consistent with sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries with at least one component between 0.2 - 1.0 solar masses. We use the null result to constrain the binary merger rate of (0.2 solar mass, 0.2 solar mass) binaries to be less than 3.7 x 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and the binary merger rate of (1.0 solar mass, 1.0 solar mass) binaries to be less than 5.2 x 10^3 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Sub-solar mass ultracompact objects are not expected to form via known stellar evolution channels, though it has been suggested that primordial density fluctuations or particle dark matter with cooling mechanisms and/or nuclear interactions could form black holes with sub-solar masses. Assuming a particular primordial black hole formation model, we constrain a population of merging 0.2 solar mass black holes to account for less than 16% of the dark matter density and a population of merging 1.0 solar mass black holes to account for less than 2% of the dark matter density. We discuss how constraints on the merger rate and dark matter fraction may be extended to arbitrary black hole population models that predict sub-solar mass binaries.","The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, B.

933,"Pisces-Eridanus (Psc-Eri), a nearby ($d$ $\simeq$ 80-226 pc) stellar stream stretching across $\approx$120 degrees of the sky, was recently discovered with Gaia data. The stream was claimed to be $\approx$1 Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars $\lambda$ Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color--magnitude data for these highest-mass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., $\approx$120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters.","Jason Lee Curtis, Marcel A.

934,"We derive the observable gravitational wave (GW) peak frequency ($f$) distribution of binary black holes (BBHs) that currently reside inside their globular clusters (GCs), with and without 2.5 Post-Newtonian (2.5PN) effects included in the dynamical evolution of the BBHs. Recent Newtonian studies have reported that a notable number of nearby non-merging BBHs, i.e. those BBHs that are expected to undergo further dynamical interactions before merger, in GCs are likely to be observable by LISA. However, our 2.5PN calculations show that the distribution of $\log f$ for the non-merging BBH population above $\sim 10^{-3.5}$ Hz scales as $f^{-34/9}$ instead of the $f^{-2/3}$ scaling found in the Newtonian case. This leads to an approximately two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the expected number of GW sources at $\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz, which lead us to conclude that observing nearby BBHs with LISA is not as likely as has been claimed in the recent literature. In fact, our results suggest that it might be more likely that LISA detects the population of BBHs that will merge before undergoing further interactions. This interestingly suggests that the BBH merger rate derived from LIGO can be used to forecast the number of nearby LISA sources, as well as providing insight into the fraction of BBH mergers forming in GCs.","Johan Samsing, Daniel J.

935,"The properties of carbon stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and their total dust production rates are predicted by fitting their spectral energy distributions (SED) over pre-computed grids of spectra reprocessed by dust. The grids are calculated as a function of the stellar parameters by consistently following the growth for several dust species in their circumstellar envelopes, coupled with a stationary wind. Dust radiative transfer is computed taking as input the results of the dust growth calculations. The optical constants for amorphous carbon are selected in order to reproduce different observations in the infrared and optical bands of \textit{Gaia} Data Release 2. We find a tail of extreme mass-losing carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with low gas-to-dust ratios that is not present in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Typical gas-to-dust ratios are around $700$ for the extreme stars, but they can be down to $\sim160$--$200$ and $\sim100$ for a few sources in the SMC and in the LMC, respectively. The total dust production rate for the carbon star population is $\sim 1.77\pm 0.45\times10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, for the LMC, and $\sim 2.52\pm 0.96 \times 10^{-6}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, for the SMC. The extreme carbon stars observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and their wind speed are studied in detail. For the most dust-obscured star in this sample the estimated mass-loss rate is $\sim 6.3 \times 10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$.

936,"Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars ($\leq$1 $M_\odot$). Unfortunately, rotation period $(P_{\rm rot})$ measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., $P_{\rm rot} \propto \sqrt{\rm age}$): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag\""ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the $\approx$1.4-Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf $P_{\rm rot}$ stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the $\approx$1-Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure $P_{\rm rot}$ for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from $\approx$0.8 to $\approx$0.6 $M_\odot$. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04$\pm$0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-$P_{\rm rot}$ sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to $T_{\rm eff} \approx 4295$ K (K5V, 0.7 $M_\odot$), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with $P_{\rm rot}$ for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where $P_{\rm rot}$ stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.","Jason Lee Curtis, Marcel A.

937,"The high-quality OmegaCAM photometry of the 3x3 deg around the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) in r, and i filters by Beccari et al.(2017) revealed three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The objects belonging to the individual sequences are concentrated towards the center of the ONC. The authors concluded that there are two competitive scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries and triples with an exotic mass ratio distribution, or three stellar populations with different ages. We use Gaia DR2 in combination with the photometric OmegaCAM catalog to test and confirm the presence of the putative three stellar populations. We also study multiple stellar systems in the ONC for the first time using Gaia DR2. We confirm that the second and third sequence members are more centrally concentrated towards the center of the ONC. In addition we find an indication that the parallax and proper motion distributions are different among the members of the stellar sequences. The age difference among stellar populations is estimated to be 1-2 Myr. We use Gaia measurements to identify and remove as many unresolved multiple system candidates as possible. Nevertheless we are still able to recover two well-separated sequences with evidence for the third one, supporting the existence of the three stellar populations. We were able to identify a substantial number of wide binary objects (separation between 1000-3000 au). This challenges previously inferred values that suggested no wide binary stars exist in the ONC. Our inferred wide-binary fraction is approx 5%. We confirm the three populations correspond to three separated episodes of star formation. Based on this result, we conclude that star formation is not happening in a single burst in this region.

938,"The Echelle spectrograph operating at Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) is a general purpose instrument designed for high resolution spectroscopy. It is being considered for precision Doppler measurements without altering the existing design and basic usage. However, the design level limitations and environmental perturbations are a major source of instability and systematic errors. As a result, a small Doppler signal in the stellar spectra is completely swamped by the large and uncontrolled instrumental drift. In this paper, we discuss some of the remedial measures we took to improve the radial velocity performance of the spectrograph. We show that a new auto-guider assembly has greatly reduced the mechanical jitter of the star image at the fibre input, making the illumination of the spectrograph slit at the other end stable. We have also installed an iodine absorption cell to track and eliminate the instrumental drifts to facilitate precision radial velocity observations. Furthermore, we have developed a generic algorithm that uses iodine exposures to extract the stellar radial velocities without the need for the complex forward modeling. Our algorithm is not accurate to the level of traditional iodine technique. However it is convenient to use on a low-cost general-purpose spectrograph targeting a moderate Radial Velocity (RV) precision at a few 10-100~$\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ level. Finally, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach by measuring the RV signal of a well known short-period, planet-hosting star.","Sireesha Chamarthi, Ravinder K. Banyal, S.

939,"Using the latest sample of 48 spiral galaxies having a directly measured supermassive black hole mass, $M_{BH}$, we determine how the maximum disk rotational velocity, $v_{max}$ (and the implied dark matter halo mass, $M_{DM}$), correlates with the (i) $M_{BH}$, (ii) central velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$, and (iii) spiral-arm pitch angle, $\phi$. We find that $M_{BH}\propto v_{max}^{10.62\pm1.37}\propto M_{DM}^{4.35\pm0.66}$, significantly steeper than previously reported, and with a root mean square scatter ($0.58$ dex) similar to that about the $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_0$ relation for spiral galaxies - in stark disagreement with claims that $M_{BH}$ does not correlate with disks. Moreover, this $M_{BH}$-$v_{max}$ relation is consistent with the unification of the Tully-Fisher relation (involving the total stellar mass, $M_{*,tot}$) and the steep $M_{BH}\propto M_{*,tot}^{3.05\pm0.53}$ relation observed in spiral galaxies. We also find that $\sigma_0\propto v_{max}^{1.55\pm0.25}\propto M_{DM}^{0.63\pm0.11}$, consistent with past studies connecting stellar bulges (with $\sigma_0\gtrsim100\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$), dark matter halos, and a nonconstant $v_{max}/\sigma_0$ ratio. Finally, we report that $\tan|\phi|\propto(-1.18\pm0.19)\log{v_{max}}\propto(-0.48\pm0.09)\log M_{DM}$, providing a novel formulation between the geometry (i.e., the logarithmic spiral-arm pitch angle) and kinematics of spiral galaxy disks. While the $v_{max}$-$\phi$ relation may facilitate distance estimations to face-on spiral galaxies through the Tully-Fisher relation and using $\phi$ as a proxy for $v_{max}$, the $M_{DM}$-$\phi$ relation provides a path for determining dark matter halo masses from imaging data alone. Furthermore, based on a spiral galaxy sample size that is double the size used previously, the self-consistent relations presented here provide dramatically revised constraints for theory and simulations.","Benjamin L.

940,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) emit substantial fluxes of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, and have therefore attracted some recent attention for their negative impact on galactic habitability. In this paper, we propose that AGNs may also engender the following beneficial effects: (i) prebiotic synthesis of biomolecular building blocks mediated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and (ii) powering photosynthesis on certain free-floating planets and moons. We also reassess the harmful biological impact of UV radiation originating from AGNs, and find that their significance could have been overestimated. Our calculations suggest that neither the positive nor negative ramifications stemming from a hypothetical AGN in the Milky Way are likely to affect putative biospheres in most of our Galaxy. On the other hand, we find that a sizable fraction of all planetary systems in galaxies with either disproportionately massive black holes ($\sim 10^{9-10}\,M_\odot$) or high stellar densities (e.g., compact dwarf galaxies) might be susceptible to both the beneficial and detrimental consequences of AGNs, with the former potentially encompassing a greater spatial extent than the latter.","Manasvi Lingam, Idan Ginsburg, Shmuel Bialy",Published in The Astrophysical Journal; 11 pages; 1 figure,1903.09768v3,No journal ref found,Shmuel Bialy,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09768v3,2019-03-23 05:33:03+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.HE,Active Galactic Nuclei: Boon or Bane for Biota?,2019-05-25 05:52:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09768v3

942,"We study tidal disruption events of rotating stars by a supermassive black hole in a galactic nucleus by using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We compare mass infall rates of tidal-disruption debris of a non-rotating and of a rotating star when they come close to the supermassive black hole. Remarkably the mass distribution of debris bound to the black hole as a function of specific energy shows clear difference between rotating and non-rotating stars, even if the stellar rotation is far from the break-up limit. The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital angular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than that of non-rotating star. The debris of a star with anti-parallel spin has a larger energy compared with a non-rotating counterpart. As a result, debris from a star with anti-parallel spin is bound more loosely to the black hole and the mass-infall rate rises later in time, while that of a star with a parallel spin is tightly bound and falls back to the black hole earlier. The different rising timescales of mass-infall rate may affect the early phase of flares due to the tidal disruptions.   In the Appendix we study the disruptions by using a uniform-density ellipsoid model which approximately takes into account the effect of strong gravity of the black hole. We find the mass infall rate reaches its maximum earlier for strong gravity cases because the debris is trapped in a deeper potential well of the black hole.","Kazuki Kagaya, Shin'ichirou Yoshida, Ataru Tanikawa",9 figures.

943,"We investigate the possibilities of reconstructing the cosmic equation of state (EoS) for high redshift. In order to obtain general results, we use two model-independent approaches. The first reconstructs the EoS using comoving distance and the second makes use of the Hubble parameter data. To implement the first method, we use a recent set of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) measures. To implement the second method, we generate simulated data using the Sandage-Loeb ($SL$) effect; for the fiducial model, we use the $\Lambda CDM$ model. In both cases, the statistical analysis is conducted through the Gaussian processes (non-parametric). In general, we demonstrate that this methodology for reconstructing the EoS using a non-parametric method plus a model-independent approach works appropriately due to the feasibility of calculation and the ease of introducing a priori information ($H_ {0}$ and $\Omega_{m0}$). In the near future, following this methodology with a higher number of high quality data will help obtain strong restrictions for the EoS.","A. M. Velasquez-Toribio, M. M. Machado, Julio C.

944,"Most bulge-dominated galaxies host black holes with masses that tightly correlate with the masses of their bulges. This may indicate that the black holes may regulate galaxy growth or vice versa, or that they may grow in lock-step. The quest to understand how, when, and where those black-holes formed motivates much of extragalactic astronomy. Here we focus on a population of galaxies with active black holes in their nuclei (active galactic nuclei or AGN), that are fully or partially hidden by dust and gas: the emission from the broad line region is either completely or partially obscured with a visual extinction of 1 or above. This limit, though not yet precise, appears to be the point at which the populations of AGN may evolve differently. We highlight the importance of finding and studying those dusty AGN at redshifts between 1 and 3, the epoch when the universe may have gone through its most dramatic changes. We emphasize the need for future large multiplexed spectroscopic instruments that can perform dedicated surveys in the optical and NIR to pin down the demographics of such objects and study their reddening properties, star-formation histories, and excitation conditions.

Advantages of this approach are relatively high peak ion currents and current densities (0.1 to several A/cm^2) that can be applied to metal wire cathodes for several days. We detect neutrons from D-D reactions with scintillator-based detectors. For palladium targets, we find neutron yields as a function of cathode voltage that are over 100 times higher than yields expected for bare nuclei fusion at ion energies below 2 keV (center of mass frame). A possible explanation is a correction to the ion energy due to an electron screening potential of 1000+/-250 eV, which increases the probability for tunneling through the repulsive Coulomb barrier. Our compact, robust setup enables parametric studies of this effect at relatively low reaction energies.","T. Schenkel, A. Persaud, H. Wang, P. A. Seidl, R. MacFadyen, C. Nelson, W. L.

946,"In this study we analyze 70 radio continuum sources associated with dust clumps and considered to be candidates for the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. The detection of these sources was reported by Rosero et al. (2016), who found most of them to show weak (${\scriptstyle <}$1 mJy) and compact (${\scriptstyle <}\,$0.6$^{\prime \prime}$) radio emission. Herein, we used the observed parameters of these sources to investigate the origin of the radio continuum emission. We found that at least $\sim 30\%$ of these radio detections are most likely ionized jets associated with high-mass protostars, but for the most compact sources we cannot discard the scenario that they represent pressure-confined HII regions. This result is highly relevant for recent theoretical models based on core accretion that predict the first stages of ionization from high-mass stars to be in the form of jets. Additionally, we found that properties such as the radio luminosity as a function of the bolometric luminosity of ionized jets from low and high-mass stars are extremely well-correlated. Our data improve upon previous studies by providing further evidence of a common origin for jets independently of luminosity.","V. Rosero, P. Hofner, S. Kurtz, R. Cesaroni, C. Carrasco-GonzáLez, E.

947,"We analyze resolved stellar near-infrared photometry of 21 HST fields in M31 to constrain the impact of metallicity on the formation of carbon stars. Observations of nearby galaxies show that the carbon stars are increasingly rare at higher metallicity. Models indicate that carbon star formation efficiency drops due to the decrease in dredge-up efficiency in metal-rich thermally-pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars, coupled to a higher initial abundance of oxygen. However, while models predict a metallicity ceiling above which carbon stars cannot form, previous observations have not yet pinpointed this limit. Our new observations reliably separate carbon stars from M-type TP-AGB stars across 2.6-13.7 kpc of M31's metal-rich disk using HST WFC3/IR medium-band filters. We find that the ratio of C to M stars (C/M) decreases more rapidly than extrapolations of observations in more metal-poor galaxies, resulting in a C/M that is too low by more than a factor of 10 in the innermost fields and indicating a dramatic decline in C star formation efficiency at metallicities higher than [M/H] $\approx$ -0.1 dex. The metallicity ceiling remains undetected, but must occur at metallicities higher than what is measured in M31's inner disk ([M/H] $\gtrsim$ +0.06 dex).","M. L. Boyer, B. F. Williams, B. Aringer, Y.

948,"Distinguishing the photon output of an accreting supermassive black hole binary system from that of a single supermassive black hole accreting at the same rate is intrinsically difficult because the majority of the light emerges from near the ISCOs of the black holes. However, there are two possible signals that can distinctively mark binaries, both arising from the gap formed in circumbinary accretion flows inside approximately twice the binary separation. One of these is a ""notch"" cut into the thermal spectra of these systems in the IR/optical/UV, the other a periodically-varying excess hard X-ray luminosity whose period is of order the binary orbital period. Using data from detailed galaxy evolution simulations, we estimate the distribution function in mass, mass ratio, and accretion rate for accreting supermassive black hole binaries as a function of redshift and then transform this distribution function into predicted source counts for these two potential signals. At flux levels >~10^{-13}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}, there may be ~O(10^2) such systems in the sky, mostly in the redshift range ~0.5 < z < ~1. Roughly 10% should have periods short enough (<~5~yr) to detect the X-ray modulation; this is also the period range accessible to PTA observations.","Julian H.

949,"We investigate the adiabatic and radiative (synchrotron and inverse-Compton) cooling of relativistic electrons whose injected/initial distribution with energy is a power-law above a typical energy $\gamma_i$. Analytical and numerical results are presented for the cooling-tail and the cooled-injected distribution that develop below and above the typical energy of injected electrons, for the evolution of the peak-energy $E_p$ of the synchrotron emission spectrum, and for the pulse shape resulting from an episode of electron injection. The synchrotron emission calculated numerically is compared with the spectrum and shape of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) pulses. Both adiabatic and radiative cooling processes lead to a softening of the pulse spectrum, and both types of cooling processes lead to pulses peaking earlier and lasting shorter at higher energy, quantitatively consistent with observations. For adiabatic-dominated electron cooling, a power-law injection rate $R_i$ suffices to explain the observed power-law GRB low-energy spectra. Synchrotron-dominated cooling leads to power-law cooling-tails that yield the synchrotron standard slope alpha = -3/2 provided that $R_i \sim B^2$, which is exactly the expectation if the magnetic field is a constant fraction of the post-shock energy density. Increasing (decreasing) $R_i$ and decreasing (increasing) B(t) lead to slopes alpha harder (softer, respectively) than the standard value and to non--power-law (curved) cooling-tails. Inverse-Compton cooling yields four values for the slope alpha but, as for synchrotron, other $R_i$ or B histories yield a wider range of slopes and curved low-energy spectra. Feedback between the power-law segments that develop below and above the typical injected electron leads to a synchrotron spectrum with many breaks above and below the usual 10 keV-1 MeV observing range.",A.

By combining the measurements given here with the published ones, we computed 76 orbits for the first time and updated orbital elements of 34 visual binaries.

951,"We discuss a solar dynamo model of Tayler-Spruit type whose Omega-effect is conventionally produced by a solar-like differential rotation but whose alpha-effect is assumed to be periodically modulated by planetary tidal forcing. This resonance-like effect has its rationale in the tendency of the current-driven Tayler instability to undergo intrinsic helicity oscillations which, in turn, can be synchronized by periodic tidal perturbations. Specifically, we focus on the 11.07 years alignment periodicity of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, whose persistent synchronization with the solar dynamo is briefly touched upon. The typically emerging dynamo modes are dipolar fields, oscillating with a 22.14 years period or pulsating with a 11.07 years period, but also quadrupolar fields with corresponding periodicities. In the absence of any constant part of alpha, we prove the subcritical nature of this Tayler-Spruit type dynamo. The resulting amplitude of the alpha oscillation that is required for dynamo action turns out to lie in the order of 1 m/s, which seems not implausible for the sun. When starting with a more classical, non-periodic part of alpha, even less of the oscillatory alpha part is needed to synchronize the entire dynamo. Typically, the dipole solutions show butterfly diagrams, although their shapes are not convincing yet. Phase coherent transitions between dipoles and quadrupoles, which are reminiscent of the observed behaviour during the Maunder minimum, can be easily triggered by long-term variations of dynamo parameters, but may also occur spontaneously even for fixed parameters. Further interesting features of the model are the typical second intensity peak and the intermittent appearance of reversed helicities in both hemispheres.","Frank Stefani, André Giesecke, Tom Weier","30 pages, 17 figures, final version",1803.08692v6,No journal ref found,Tom Weier,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08692v6,2018-03-23 08:55:31+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,A model of a tidally synchronized solar dynamo,2019-05-24 20:06:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08692v6
952,"""How much of the Solar System should we reserve as wilderness, off-limits to human development?"" We argue that, as a matter of policy, development should be limited to one eighth, with the remainder set aside. We argue that adopting a ""1/8 principle"" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might seem. One eighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater than all of the Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries. A limit of some sort is needed because of the problems associated with exponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such growth, so the limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three doubling times which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and then to the point of exhaustion. Population growth and climate change are instances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon ouru available resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to do so at this comparatively late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited ability to see ahead suggests that we should set ourselves a 'tripwire' that gives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System resources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the space economy, comparable to that of the iron use from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would be reached after 400 years. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate means that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new ""steady state"" conditions. The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is that it may be far easier to implement in principle restrictions at an early stage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come into existence.","Martin Elvis, Tony Milligan","18 pages, 0 figures, 1 table.

953,"Assuming that inflation is followed by a phase where the energy density of the Universe is dominated by a component with a general equation of state, we evaluate the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves induced in the post-inflationary Universe. We show that if the energy density of the Universe is dominated by a component $\phi$ before Big Bang nucleosynthesis, its equation of state could be constrained by gravitational wave experiments depending on the ratio of energy densities of $\phi$ and radiation, and also the temperature at the end of the $\phi$ dominated era. Also, we discuss the impact of scale dependence of tensor modes on the primordial gravitational wave spectrum during the $\phi$-domination. These models are motivated by beyond Standard Model physics and scenarios for non-thermal production of dark matter in the early Universe. We also constrain the parameter space of the tensor spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, using the experimental limits from gravitational wave experiments.","Nicolás Bernal, Fazlollah Hajkarim","25 pages, 7 figures",1905.10410v1,No journal ref found,Fazlollah Hajkarim,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10410v1,2019-05-24 19:05:49+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph|hep-th,Primordial Gravitational Waves in Non-standard Cosmologies,2019-05-24 19:05:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10410v1
954,"Supersonically induced gas objects (SIGOs) with little to no dark matter component are predicted to exist in patches of the Universe with non-negligible relative velocity between baryons and the dark matter at the time of recombination. Using {\sc arepo} hydrodynamic simulations we find that the gas densities inside these objects are high enough to allow stars to form. An estimate of the luminosity of the first star clusters formed within these SIGOs suggests that they may be observed at high redshift using future HST and JWST observations. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that SIGOs lie in a distinct place in the luminosity-radius parameter space, which can be used observationally to distinguish SIGOs from dark-matter hosting gas systems. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we model star formation before reionization and evolve these systems to current times. We find that SIGOs occupy a similar part of the magnitude-radius parameter space as globular clusters. These results suggest that SIGOs may be linked with present-day metal-poor local globular clusters. Since the relative velocity between the baryons and dark matter is coherent over a few Mpc scales, we predict that if this is the dominant mechanism for the formation of globular clusters, their abundance should vary significantly over these scales.","Yeou S.

We employ three different semi-coherent methods ($\textit{FrequencyHough}$, $\textit{SkyHough}$, and $\textit{Time-Domain $\mathcal{F}$-statistic}$) to search in a gravitational-wave frequency band from 20 to 1922 Hz and a first frequency derivative from $-1\times10^{-8}$ to $2\times10^{-9}$ Hz/s. None of these searches has found clear evidence for a CW signal, so we present upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude $h_0$ (the lowest upper limit on $h_0$ is $1.7\times10^{-25}$ in the 123-124 Hz region) and discuss the astrophysical implications of this result.

956,"We introduce AXS (Astronomy eXtensions for Spark), a scalable open-source astronomical data analysis framework built on Apache Spark, a widely used industry-standard engine for big data processing. Building on capabilities present in Spark, AXS aims to enable querying and analyzing almost arbitrarily large astronomical catalogs using familiar Python/AstroPy concepts, DataFrame APIs, and SQL statements. We achieve this by i) adding support to Spark for efficient on-line positional cross-matching and ii) supplying a Python library supporting commonly-used operations for astronomical data analysis. To support scalable cross-matching, we developed a variant of the ZONES algorithm (Gray et al. 2004) capable of operating in distributed, shared-nothing architecture. We couple this to a data partitioning scheme that enables fast catalog cross-matching and handles the data skew often present in deep all-sky data sets. The cross-match and other often-used functionalities are exposed to the end users through an easy-to-use Python API. We demonstrate AXS' technical and scientific performance on SDSS, ZTF, Gaia DR2, and AllWise catalogs. Using AXS we were able to perform on-the-fly cross-match of Gaia DR2 (1.8 billion rows) and AllWise (900 million rows) data sets in ~ 30 seconds. We discuss how cloud-ready distributed systems like AXS provide a natural way to enable comprehensive end-user analyses of large datasets such as LSST.","Petar Zečević, Colin T.

957,"Electron capture on $^{20}$Ne is critically important for the final stage of evolution of stars with the initial masses of 8 - 10 $M_{\odot}$. In the present paper, we evaluate electron capture rates for a forbidden transition $^{20}$Ne (0$_{g.s.}^{+}$) $\rightarrow$ $^{20}$F (2$_{g.s.}^{+}$) in stellar environments by the multipole expansion method with the use of shell-model Hamiltonians. These rates have not been accurately determined in theory as well as in experiments. Our newly evaluated rates are compared with those obtained by a prescription that treats the transition as an allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transition with the strength determined from a recent $\beta$-decay experiment for $^{20}$F (2$_{g.s.}^{+}$) $\rightarrow$ $^{20}$Ne (0$_{g.s.}^{+}$) \citep{Kirsebom}. We find that different electron energy dependence of the transition strengths between the two methods leads to sizable differences in the weak rates of the two methods. We also find that the Coulomb effects, that is, the effects of screening on ions and electrons are non-negligible. We apply our e-capture rates on $^{20}$Ne to the calculation of the evolution of high-density O-Ne-Mg cores of 8 - 10 $M_{\odot}$ stars. We find that our new rates affect the abundance distribution and the central density at the final stage of evolution.","Toshio Suzuki, Shuai Zha, Shing-Chi Leung, Ken'ichi Nomoto","Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal on May 7, 2019",1905.10400v1,No journal ref found,Ken'ichi Nomoto,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10400v1,2019-05-24 18:32:19+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|nucl-th,Electron capture rates in $^{20}$Ne for a forbidden transition to the   ground state of $^{20}$F relevant to final evolution of high density O-Ne-Mg   cores,2019-05-24 18:32:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10400v1
958,"We discuss the Damour--Esposito-Far\`ese model of gravity, which predicts the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars in a certain range of parameter space. In the cosmological setup, the scalar field responsible for scalarization is subject to a tachyonic instability during inflation and the matter domination stage, resulting in a large value of the field today. This value feeds into the PPN parameters, which turn out to be in gross conflict with the Solar system measurements. We modify the original Damour--Esposito-Far\`ese model by coupling the scalar to the inflaton field. This coupling acts as an effective mass for the scalar during inflation. For generic couplings that are not extremely small, the scalar (including its perturbations) relaxes to zero with an exponential accuracy by the beginning of the hot stage. While the scalar exhibits growth during the subsequent cosmological stages, the resulting present value remains very small---in a comfortable agreement with the Solar system tests.","Timothy Anson, Eugeny Babichev, Sabir Ramazanov",16 pages,1905.10393v1,No journal ref found,Sabir Ramazanov,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10393v1,2019-05-24 18:03:46+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|hep-th,Reconciling spontaneous scalarization with cosmology,2019-05-24 18:03:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10393v1
959,"Numerical solutions of partial differential equations enable a broad range of scientific research. The Dedalus Project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation. The Dedalus code and the example problems are available online at http://dedalus-project.org/.","Keaton J. Burns, Geoffrey M. Vasil, Jeffrey S. Oishi, Daniel Lecoanet, Benjamin P.

960,We present an unprecedented view on the morphology and kinematics of the extended narrow-line region (ENLR) and molecular gas around the prototypical hyper-luminous quasar 3C273 ($L\sim10^{47}$ erg/s at z=0.158) based on VLT-MUSE optical 3D spectroscopy and ALMA observations. We find that: 1) The ENLR size of 12.1$\pm$0.2kpc implies a smooth continuation of the size-luminosity relation out to large radii or a much larger break radius as previously proposed. 2) The kinematically disturbed ionized gas with line splits reaching 1000km/s out to 6.1$\pm$1.5kpc is aligned along the jet axis. 3) The extreme line broadening on kpc scales is caused by spatial and spectral blending of many distinct gas clouds separated on sub-arcsecond scales with different line-of-sight velocities. The ENLR velocity field combined with the known jet orientation rule out a simple scenario of a radiatively-driven radial expansion of the outflow. Instead we propose that a pressurized expanding hot gas cocoon created by the radio jet is impacting on an inclined gas disk leading to transverse and/or backflow motion with respect to our line-of-sight. The molecular gas morphology may either be explained by a density wave at the front of the outflow expanding along the jet direction as predicted by positive feedback scenario or the cold gas may be trapped in a stellar over-density caused by a recent merger event. Using 3C273 as a template for observations of high-redshift hyper-luminous AGN reveals that large-scale ENLRs and kpc scale outflows may often be missed due to the brightness of the nuclei and the limited sensitivity of current near-IR instrumentation.,"B.

961,"We have investigated the long term average spectral properties of galactic X-ray binaries in the energy range of 3-20 keV, using long term monitoring data from MAXI -Gas Slit Camera (GSC). These long term average spectra are used to construct separately the composite spectra of galactic High Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and Low Mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These composite spectra can be described empirically with piece-wise power-law with three components. X-rays from HMXBs are considered as important contributors to heating and ionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization. Using the above empirical form of the composite HMXB spectra extrapolated to lower energies as an input, we have studied the impact of these sources on the 21-cm signal using the outputs of N-body simulation and 1D radiative transfer. The heating due to the composite spectrum is less patchy compared to power-law spectrum with a spectral index $\alpha = 1.5$, used in previous studies. The amplitude of the heating peak of large scale power spectrum, when plotted as a function of the redshift, is less for the composite spectrum.","Nazma Islam, Raghunath Ghara, Biswajit Paul, T.

962,"[Abridged] We combine extensive spatially-resolved multi-wavelength observations, taken as part of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS), for the edge-on disc galaxy HE1353-1917 to characterize the impact of the AGN on its host galaxy via outflows and radiation. Multi-color broad-band photometry is combined with spatially-resolved optical, NIR and sub-mm and radio observations taken with VLT/MUSE, Gemini-N/NIFS, ALMA and the VLA to map the physical properties and kinematics of the multi-phase inter-stellar medium (ISM). We detect a biconical extended narrow-line region (ENLR) ionized by the luminous AGN oriented nearly parallel to the galaxy disc, extending out to at least 25kpc. The extra-planar gas originates from galactic fountains initiated by star formation processes in the disc, rather than an AGN outflow, as shown by the kinematics and the metallicity of the gas. Nevertheless, a fast multi-phase AGN-driven outflow with speeds up to 1000km/s is detected close to the nucleus at 1kpc distance. A radio jet, in connection with the AGN radiation field, is likely responsible for driving the outflow as confirmed by the energetics and the spatial alignment of the jet and multi-phase outflow. Evidence for negative AGN feedback suppressing the star formation rate (SFR) is mild and restricted to the central kpc. But while any SFR suppression must have happened recently, the outflow has the potential to greatly impact the future evolution of the galaxy disc due to its geometrical orientation. Our observations reveal that low-power radio jets can play a major role in driving fast multi-phase galaxy-scale outflows even in radio-quiet AGN. Since the outflow energetics for HE1353-1917 are consistent with literature scaling relations of AGN-driven outflows the contribution of radio jets as the driving mechanisms still needs to be systematically explored.","B.

963,"The [CII]158$\mu$m line is one of the strongest far-infrared (FIR) lines and an important coolant in the interstellar medium of galaxies that is accessible out to high redshifts. The excitation of [CII] is complex and can best be studied in detail at low redshifts. Here we report the discovery of the highest global [CII] excess with respect to the FIR luminosity in the nearby AGN host galaxy HE1353-1917. This galaxy is exceptional among a sample of five targets because the AGN ionization cone and radio jet directly intercept the cold galactic disk. As a consequence, a massive multiphase gas outflow on kiloparsec scales is embedded in an extended narrow-line region. Because HE1353-1917 is distinguished by these special properties from our four bright AGN, we propose that a global [CII] excess in AGN host galaxies could be a direct signature of a multiphase AGN-driven outflow with a high mass-loading factor.","I.

964,"Inserting a varying Lambda in Einstein's field equations can be made consistent with Bianchi identities by allowing for torsion, without the need for adding scalar field degrees of freedom. In the minimal such theory, in the absence of matter Lambda is totally free and undetermined by the field equations. Inclusion of matter ties Lambda algebraically to it, at least in a set up where homogeneity and isotropy are assumed, i.e.\ when there is no Weyl curvature. We show that Lambda is proportional to the matter density, with a proportionality constant that depends on the equation of state. Unfortunately, the proportionality constant becomes infinite for pure radiation, ruling out the minimal theory {\it prima facie}, in spite of its novel internal consistency. It is possible to generalize the theory still without the addition of kinetic terms (which would bring it close to a more conventional quintessence model). We now find a new algebraically-enforced proportionality between Lambda and the matter density. Lambda and radiation may now coexist in a form consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis, though this places strict constraints on the single free parameter of the theory, $\theta$. In the matter epoch Lambda behaves just like a dark matter component. Its density is proportional to the baryonic and/or dark matter, and its presence and gravitational effects would need to be included in accounting for the necessary dark matter in our Universe. This is a companion paper to Ref. [1] where the underlying gravitational theory is developed in detail.","Stephon Alexander, Marina Cortês, Andrew R.

965,"We show unsupervised machine learning techniques are a valuable tool for both visualizing and computationally accelerating the estimation of galaxy physical properties from photometric data. As a proof of concept, we use self organizing maps (SOMs) to visualize a spectral energy distribution (SED) model library in the observed photometry space. The resulting visual maps allow for a better understanding of how the observed data maps to physical properties and to better optimize the model libraries for a given set of observational data. Next, the SOMs are used to estimate the physical parameters of 14,000 z~1 galaxies in the COSMOS field and found to be in agreement with those measured with SED fitting. However, the SOM method is able to estimate the full probability distribution functions for each galaxy up to about a million times faster than direct model fitting. We conclude by discussing how this speed up and learning how the galaxy data manifold maps to physical parameter space and visualizing this mapping in lower dimensions helps overcome other challenges in galaxy formation and evolution.","Shoubaneh Hemmati, Peter Capak, Milad Pourrahmani, Hooshang Nayyeri, Daniel Stern, Bahram Mobasher, Behnam Darvish, Iary Davidzon, Olivier Ilbert, Daniel Masters, Abtin Shahidi","6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJL",1905.10379v1,No journal ref found,Abtin Shahidi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10379v1,2019-05-24 18:00:04+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Bringing manifold learning and dimensionality reduction to SED fitters,2019-05-24 18:00:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10379v1
966,"We provide a new extension of general relativity (GR) which has the remarkable property of being more constrained than GR plus a cosmological constant, having one less free parameter. This is implemented by allowing the cosmological constant to have a consistent space-time variation, through coding its dynamics in the torsion tensor. We demonstrate this mechanism by adding a `quasi-topological' term to the Einstein action, which naturally realizes a dynamical torsion with an automatic satisfaction of the Bianchi identities. Moreover, variation of the action with respect to this dynamical $\Lambda$ fixes it in terms of other variables, thus providing a scenario with less freedom than general relativity with a cosmological constant. Once matter is introduced, at least in the homogeneous and isotropic reduction, $\Lambda$ is uniquely determined by the field content of the model. We make an explicit construction using the Palatini formulation of GR and describe the striking properties of this new theory. We also highlight some possible extensions to the theory. A companion paper [1] explores the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker reduction for cosmology, and future work will study Solar System tests of the theory.","Stephon Alexander, Marina Cortês, Andrew R.

967,"Spectrally-resolved observations of three pure rotational lines of H$_2$, conducted with the EXES instrument on SOFIA toward the classic bow shock HH7, reveal systematic velocity shifts between the S(5) line of ortho-H$_2$ and the two para-H$_2$ lines [S(4) and S(6)] lying immediately above and below it on the rotational ladder. These shifts, reported here for the first time, imply that we are witnessing the conversion of para-H$_2$ to ortho-H$_2$ within a shock wave driven by an outflow from a young stellar object. The observations are in good agreement with the predictions of models for non-dissociative, C-type molecular shocks. They provide a clear demonstration of the chemical changes wrought by interstellar shock waves, in this case the conversion of para-H$_2$ to ortho-H$_2$ in reactive collisions with atomic hydrogen, and provide among the most compelling evidence yet obtained for C-type shocks in which the flow velocity changes continuously.","David A.

968,"Line intensity maps (LIMs) are in principle sensitive to a large amount of information about faint, distant galaxies which are invisible to conventional surveys. However, actually extracting that information from a confused, foreground-contaminated map can be challenging. In this work we present the first application of convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly determine the underlying luminosity function of a LIM, including a treatment of extragalactic foregrounds and instrumental noise. We apply the CNN to simulations of mock Carbon Monoxide (CO) line intensity maps similar to those which will be produced by the currently-active COMAP experiment. We evaluate the trained CNN on a number of noise scenarios in order to determine how robust the network predictions are for application to realistic data. We find that, in the ideal case where the mock data capture all of the features of the real data, the CNN performs comparably to or better than conventional analyses. However, the network's accuracy degrades considerably when tested on signals and systematics outside of those it was trained on. For both intensity mapping and cosmology as a whole, this motivates a broad-based study of whether simulated data can ever be generated with sufficient detail to realize the enormous potential of machine learning methods.","Daniel N.

We first show that the standard subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) recipe implemented with MultiDark characterizes the clustering of galaxies well both at redshift 0 for SDSS and at redshift 1 for VIPERS. This is an important validation of the SHAM model at high redshift. We then remap the simulation timesteps to test alternative growth histories and infer the growth index $\gamma=0.6\pm0.3$.

971,"Given the absence of directly detected dark matter (DM) as weakly interacting massive particles, there is strong interest in the possibility that DM is an ultra-light scalar field, here denoted as fuzzy DM. Ultra-diffuse galaxies, with the sizes of giant galaxies and the luminosities of dwarf galaxies, have a wide range of DM halo masses, thus providing new opportunities for exploring the connections between galaxies and their DM halos. Following up on new integral field unit spectroscopic observations and dynamics modeling of the DM-dominated ultra-diffuse galaxy Dragonfly 44 in the outskirts of the Coma Cluster, we present models of fuzzy DM constrained by the stellar dynamics of this galaxy. We infer a scalar field mass of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-22}$ eV, consistent with other constraints from galaxy dynamics but in tension with constraints from Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum modeling. While we are unable to statistically distinguish between fuzzy DM and normal cold DM models, we find that the inferred properties of the fuzzy DM halo satisfy a number of predictions for halos in a fuzzy DM cosmology. In particular, we find good agreement with the predicted core size--halo mass relation and the predicted transition radius between the quantum pressure-dominated inner region and the outer halo region.","Asher Wasserman, Pieter van Dokkum, Aaron J.

972,"The analysis of the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at different wavelengths and the study of possible correlations among different spectral windows are nowadays a major field of inquiry. Optical variability has been largely used to identify AGNs in multivisit surveys. The strength of a selection based on optical variability lies in the chance to analyze data from surveys of large sky areas by ground-based telescopes. However the effectiveness of optical variability selection, with respect to other multiwavelength techniques, has been poorly studied down to the depth expected from next generation surveys. Here we present the results of our r-band analysis of a sample of 299 optically variable AGN candidates in the VST survey of the COSMOS field, counting 54 visits spread over three observing seasons spanning > 3 yr. This dataset is > 3 times larger in size than the one presented in our previous analysis (De Cicco et al. 2015), and the observing baseline is ~8 times longer. We push towards deeper magnitudes (r(AB) ~23.5 mag) compared to past studies; we make wide use of ancillary multiwavelength catalogs in order to confirm the nature of our AGN candidates, and constrain the accuracy of the method based on spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. We also perform tests aimed at assessing the relevance of dense sampling in view of future wide-field surveys. We demonstrate that the method allows the selection of high-purity (> 86%) samples. We take advantage of the longer observing baseline to achieve great improvement in the completeness of our sample with respect to X-ray and spectroscopically confirmed samples of AGNs (59%, vs. ~15% in our previous work), as well as in the completeness of unobscured and obscured AGNs. The effectiveness of the method confirms the importance to develop future, more refined techniques for the automated analysis of larger datasets.","D. De Cicco, M. Paolillo, S. Falocco, M.

973,"We investigated the possibility of diagnosing the degree of departure from the Maxwellian distribution using the Fe XVII - Fe XVIII spectra originating in plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium, such as in the cores of solar active regions or microflares. The original collision strengths for excitation are integrated over the non-Maxwellian electron $\kappa$-distributions characterized by a high-energy tail. Synthetic X-ray emission line spectra were calculated for a range of temperatures and $\kappa$. We focus on the 6-24 A spectral range to be observed by the upcoming Marshall Grazing-Incidence X-ray Spectrometer MaGIXS. We find that many line intensity ratios are sensitive to both $T$ and $\kappa$. Best diagnostic options are provided if a ratio involving both Fe XVII and Fe XVIII is combined with another ratio involving lines formed within a single ion. The sensitivity of such diagnostics to $\kappa$ is typically a few tens of per cent. Much larger sensitivity, of about a factor of two to three, can be obtained if the Fe XVIII 93.93 A line observed by SDO/AIA is used in conjuction with the X-ray lines.

974,"We study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by non-Gaussian curvature perturbations. We calculate the density parameter per logarithmic frequency interval, $\Omega_\text{GW}(k)$, given that the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)$ has a narrow peak at some small scale $k_*$, with a local-type non-Gaussianity, and constrain the nonlinear parameter $f_\text{NL}$ with the future LISA sensitivity curve as well as with constraints from the abundance of the primordial black holes (PBHs). We find that the non-Gaussian contribution to $\Omega_\text{GW}$ increases as $k^3$, peaks at $k/k_*=4/\sqrt{3}$, and has a sharp cutoff at $k=4k_*$. The non-Gaussian part can exceed the Gaussian part if $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)f_\text{NL}^2\gtrsim1$. If both a slope $\Omega_\text{GW}(k)\propto k^\beta$ with $\beta\sim3$ and the multiple-peak structure around a cutoff are observed, it can be recognized as a smoking gun of the primordial non-Gaussianity. We also find that if PBHs with masses of $10^{20}\text{g}$ to $10^{22}\text{g}$ are identified as cold dark matter of the Universe, the corresponding GWs must be detectable by LISA-like detectors, irrespective of the value of $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ or $f_\text{NL}$.","Rong-gen Cai, Shi Pi, Misao Sasaki","8 pages, 4 figures.

976,"We present a detection of the splashback feature around galaxy clusters selected using their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. Recent measurements of the splashback feature around optically selected galaxy clusters have found that the splashback radius, $r_{\rm sp}$, is smaller than predicted by N-body simulations. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that $r_{\rm sp}$ inferred from the observed radial distribution of galaxies is affected by selection effects related to the optical cluster-finding algorithms. We test this possibility by measuring the splashback feature in clusters selected via the SZ effect in data from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter survey. The measurement is accomplished by correlating these clusters with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data. The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is expected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to projection effects and aperture-induced biases than optically selected clusters. We find that the measured $r_{\rm sp}$ for SZ-selected clusters is consistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of SZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult. In agreement with previous work, when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters, $r_{\rm sp}$ is $\sim$ $2\sigma$ smaller than in the simulations. These results motivate detailed investigations of selection biases in optically selected cluster catalogs and exploration of the splashback feature around larger samples of SZ-selected clusters. Additionally, we investigate trends in the galaxy profile and splashback feature as a function of galaxy color, finding that blue galaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback feature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the cluster.","T.

977,"Any unambiguous detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by a pulsar timing array will rest on the measurement of a characteristic angular correlation between pulsars. The ability to measure this correlation will depend on the geometry of the array. However, spatially correlated sources of noise, such as errors in the planetary ephemeris or clock errors, can produce false-positive correlations. The severity of this contamination will also depend on the geometry of the array. This paper quantifies these geometric effects with a spherical harmonic analysis of the pulsar timing residuals. At least 9 well-spaced pulsars are needed to simultaneously measure a gravitational wave background and separate it from ephemeris and clock errors. Uniform distributions of pulsars can eliminate the contamination for arrays with large numbers of pulsars, but pulsars following the galactic distribution of known millisecond pulsars will always be affected. We quantitatively demonstrate the need for arrays to include many pulsars and for the pulsars to be distributed as uniformly as possible. Finally, we suggest a technique to cleanly separate the effect of ephemeris and clock errors from the gravitational wave signal.",Elinore Roebber,"15 pages, 10 figures.

978,"The DKIST is designed to deliver accurate spectropolarimetric calibrations across a wide wavelength range and large field of view for solar observations. Instruments deliver spectral resolving powers up to 300,000 in multiple cameras of several instrument. We require detailed knowledge of optical coatings on all optics to ensure we can predict and calibrate the polarization behavior of the system. Optical coatings can be metals protected by many dielectric layers or several-micron thick dichroics. Strong spectral gradients up to 60deg retardance per nanometer wavelength and several percent diattenuation per nanometer wavelength are observed in such coatings. Often, optical coatings are not specified with spectral gradient targets for polarimetry in combination to both average and spectral threshold type specifications. DKIST has a suite of interchangeable dichroic beam splitters using up to 96 layers. We apply the Berreman formalism in open-source Python scripts to derive coating polarization behavior. We present high spectral resolution examples on dichroics where transmission can drop 10% with associated polarization changes over a 1 nm spectral bandpass in both mirrors and dichroics. We design dichroic coatings that pass polarization spectral gradient requirements in addition to reflectivity. We now can fit multi-layer coating designs to predict system level polarization properties of mirrors, anti-reflection coatings and dichroics at arbitrary incidence angles, high spectral resolving power on curved surfaces through optical modeling software packages. Polarization predictions for large astronomical telescopes require significant metrology efforts on individual optical components combined with systems-level modeling efforts.

High cadence photometry over phases from 20 to 100 degrees allows a fit to the values of the HG photometric parameters; H = 14.57 +/- 0.02, 13.63 +/- 0.02, 13.28 +/- 0.02, 13.07 +/- 0.02; G = 0.00 +/- 0.01, -0.09 +/- 0.01, -0.10 +/- 0.01, -0.08 +/- 0.01 in the BVRI filters respectively; the negative G values are consistent with other observations of F type asteroids. Light curve variations were seen that are also consistent with concavities reported by Arecibo, indicative of large craters on Phaethon's surface whose ejecta may be the source of the Geminid meteoroid stream. A search for gas/dust production set an upper limit of 0.06 +/- 0.02 kg/s when Phaethon was 1.449 AU from the Sun, and 0.2 +/- 0.1 kg/s at 1.067 AU. A search for meter-class fragments accompanying Phaethon did not find any whose on-sky motion was not also consistent with background main belt asteroids.","Maryam Tabeshian, Paul Wiegert, Quanzhi Ye, Man-To Hui, Xing Gao, Hanjie Tan","Accepted by the Astronomical Journal, 15 pages, 8 figures, 1 animated

980,"We present a blind time-delay strong lensing (TDSL) cosmographic analysis of the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332. We combine the relative time delay between the quasar images, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, the Keck stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, and wide-field photometric and spectroscopic data of the field to constrain two angular diameter distance relations. The combined analysis is performed by forward modelling the individual data sets through a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and it is kept blind until the very end to prevent experimenter bias. After unblinding, the inferred distances imply a Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.8^{+5.4}_{-5.1}$ kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, assuming a flat Lambda cold dark matter cosmology with uniform prior on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate independent analysis. The consistency between blind measurements with independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling systematics. By combining the likelihoods of the four systems under the same prior, we obtain $H_0 = 72.5^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$.

981,"Using the new equipment of the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope, we have searched for carbon-chain molecules (CCMs) towards five outflow sources and six Lupus I starless dust cores, including one region known to be characterized by warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC), Lupus I-1 (IRAS 15398-3359), and one TMC-1 like cloud, Lupus I-6 (Lupus-1A). Lines of HC3N J=2-1, HC5N J=6-5, HC7N J=14-13, 15-14, 16-15 and C3S J=3-2 were detected in all the targets except in the outflow source L1660 and the starless dust core Lupus I-3/4. The column densities of nitrogen-bearing species range from 10$^{12}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and those of C$_3$S are about 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. Two outflow sources, I20582+7724 and L1221, could be identified as new carbon-chain--producing regions. Four of the Lupus I dust cores are newly identified as early quiescent and dark carbon-chain--producing regions similar to Lup I-6, which together with the WCCC source, Lup I-1, indicate that carbon-chain-producing regions are popular in Lupus I which can be regard as a Taurus like molecular cloud complex in our Galaxy. The column densities of C3S are larger than those of HC7N in the three outflow sources I20582, L1221 and L1251A. Shocked carbon-chain chemistry (SCCC) is proposed to explain the abnormal high abundances of C3S compared with those of nitrogen-bearing CCMs. Gas-grain chemical models support the idea that shocks can fuel the environment of those sources with enough $S^+$ thus driving the generation of S-bearing CCMs.","Yuefang Wu, Xunchuan Liu, Xi Chen, Lianghao Lin, Jinghua Yuan, Chao Zhang, Tie Liu, Zhiqiang Shen, Juan Li, Junzhi Wang, Sheng-Li Qin, Kee-Tae Kim, Hongli Liu, Lei Zhu, Diego Madones, Natalia Inostroza, C.

982,"We use $N$-body simulations to probe the early phases of the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and focus on mass and velocity distributions of unbound stars. In this parameter space study, we vary the initial virial ratio and degree of spatial and kinematic substructure and analyse the fraction of stars that become unbound in two different mass classes (above and below 8 M$_{\odot}$). We find that the fraction of unbound stars differs depending on the initial conditions. After 10 Myr, in initially highly subvirial, substructured simulations, the high-mass and lower-mass unbound fractions are similar at $\sim$23 per cent. In initially virialised, substructured simulations, we find only $\sim$16 per cent of all high-mass stars are unbound, whereas $\sim$37 per cent of all lower-mass stars are. The velocity distributions of unbound stars only show differences for extremely different initial conditions. The distributions are dominated by large numbers of lower-mass stars becoming unbound just above the escape velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$ with unbound high-mass stars moving faster on average than lower-mass unbound stars. We see no high-mass runaway stars (velocity > 30 km s$^{-1}$) from any of our initial conditions and only an occasional lower-mass runaway star from initially subvirial/substructured simulations. In our simulations, we find a small number of lower-mass walkaway stars (with velocity 5-30 km s$^{-1}$) from all of our initial conditions. These walkaway stars should be observable around many nearby star-forming regions with Gaia.","Christina Schoettler, Richard J. Parker, Becky Arnold, Liam P. Grimmett, Jos de Bruijne, Nicholas J.

983,"In the pre-main-sequence stage, star-disc interactions have been shown to remove stellar angular momentum and regulate the rotation periods of stars with M2 and earlier spectral types. Whether disc regulation also extends to stars with later spectral types still remains a matter of debate. Here we present a star-disc interaction study in a sample of over 180 stars with spectral types M3 and later (corresponding to stellar masses $\leq 0.3 M_\odot$) in young stellar cluster NGC 2264. Combining rotation periods from the literature, new and literature spectral types, and newly presented deep Spitzer observations, we show that stars with masses below 0.3 $M_\odot$ with discs also rotate slower than stars without a disc in the same mass regime. Our results demonstrate that disc-regulation still operates in these low-mass stars, although the efficiency of this process might be lower than in higher-mass objects. We confirm that stars with spectral types earlier and later than M2 have distinct period distributions and that stars with spectral types M5 and later rotate even faster M3 and M4-type stars.","Santiago Orcajo, Lucas A.

984,"We report the discovery of the first spectroscopically resolved C II /C II* 1334, 1335A doublet in the Lyman-break galaxy J0215-0555 at z = 5.754. The separation of the resonant and fluorescent emission channels was possible thanks to the large redshift of the source and long integration time, as well as the small velocity width of the feature, 0.6 +- 0.2A. We model this emission and find that at least two components are required to reproduce the combination of morphologies of C II* emission, C II absorption and emission, and Lyman-alpha emission from the object. We suggest that the close alignment between the fluorescence and Lyman-alpha emission could indicate an ionisation escape channel within the object. While the faintness of such a C II /C II* doublet makes it prohibitively difficult to pursue for similar systems with current facilities, we suggest it can become a valuable porosity diagnostic in the era of JWST and the upcoming generations of ELTs.","Sarah E.

985,"We show that the recently discovered binary 2M05215658+4359220 (2M0521), comprised of a giant star (GS) orbiting a suspected black hole (BH) in a ~80 day orbit, may be instrumental in shedding light on uncertain BH-formation physics and can be a test case for studying wind accretion models. Using binary population synthesis with a realistic prescription for the star formation history and metallicity evolution of the Milky Way, we analyze the evolution of binaries containing compact objects (COs) in orbit around GSs with properties similar to 2M0521. We find ~100-1000 CO-GS binaries in the Milky Way observable by Gaia, and 0-12 BH-GS and 0-1 neutron star-GS binaries in the Milky Way with properties similar to 2M0521. We find that all CO-GSs with Porb<5 yr, including 2M0521, go through a common envelope (CE) and hence form a class of higher mass analogs to white dwarf post-CE binaries. We further show how the component masses of 2M0521-like binaries depend strongly on the supernova-engine model we adopt. Thus, an improved measurement of the orbit of 2M0521, imminent with Gaia's third data release, will strongly constrain its component masses and as a result inform supernova-engine models widely used in binary population synthesis studies. These results have widespread implications for the origins and properties of CO binaries, especially those detectable by LIGO and LISA. Finally, we show that the reported X-ray non-detection of 2M0521 is a challenge for wind accretion theory, making 2M0521-like CO-GS binaries a prime target for further study with accretion models.","Katelyn Breivik, Sourav Chatterjee, Jeff J.

986,"We study the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters through Faraday rotation measurements crossing systems in different dynamical states. We confirm that magnetic fields are present in those systems and analyze the difference between relaxed and unrelaxed samples with respect to the dispersion between their inherent Faraday Rotation measurements. We found an increase of this RM dispersion and a higher RM overlapping frequency for unrelaxed clusters. This fact suggests that a large scale physical process is involved in the nature of unrelaxed systems and possible depolarization effects are present in the relaxed ones. We show that dynamically unrelaxed systems can enhance magnetic fields to large coherence lengths. In contrast, the results for relaxed systems suggests that small-scale dynamo can be a dominant mechanism for sustaining magnetic fields, leading to intrinsic depolarization.","Federico A.

987,"Direct detection experiments have set increasingly stringent limits on the cross section for spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions. In obtaining such limits, experiments primarily assume the standard halo model (SHM) as the distribution of dark matter in our Milky Way. Three astrophysical parameters are required to define the SHM: the local dark matter escape velocity, the local dark matter density and the circular velocity of the sun around the center of the galaxy. This paper studies the effect of the uncertainties in these three astrophysical parameters on the XENON1T exclusion limits using the publicly available DDCalc code. We compare limits obtained using the widely assumed escape velocity from the RAVE survey and the newly calculated escape velocity by Monari $et$ $al.$ using Gaia data. Our study finds that the astrophysical uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in the escape velocity (independent of the best fit value) at dark matter masses below 6 GeV and can lead to a variation of nearly 6 orders of magnitude in the exclusion limits at 4 GeV. Above a WIMP mass of 6 GeV, the uncertainty becomes dominated by the local dark matter density, leading to uncertainties of factors of $\sim$10 (3) at 6 (15) GeV WIMP mass in the exclusion limits. Additionally, this work finds that the updated best fit value for the escape velocity based on Gaia data leads to only very minor changes to the effects of the astrophysical uncertainties on the XENON1T exclusion limits.","Youjia Wu, Katherine Freese, Chris Kelso, Patrick Stengel, Monica Valluri","12 pages, 3 figures; author added, references added, minor revisions",1904.04781v2,No journal ref found,Monica Valluri,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04781v2,2019-04-09 16:55:27+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Uncertainties in Direct Dark Matter Detection in Light of Gaia,2019-05-24 15:51:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04781v2
988,"The Cassini mission unveiled the intense and diverse activity in Saturn's atmosphere: banded jets, waves, vortices, equatorial oscillations. To set the path towards a better understanding of those phenomena, we performed high-resolution multi-annual numerical simulations of Saturn's atmospheric dynamics. We built a new Global Climate Model [GCM] for Saturn, named the Saturn DYNAMICO GCM, by combining a radiative-seasonal model tailored for Saturn to a hydrodynamical solver based on an icosahedral grid suitable for massively-parallel architectures. The impact of numerical dissipation, and the conservation of angular momentum, are examined in the model before a reference simulation employing the Saturn DYNAMICO GCM with a $1/2^{\circ}$ latitude-longitude resolution is considered for analysis. Mid-latitude banded jets showing similarity with observations are reproduced by our model. Those jets are accelerated and maintained by eddy momentum transfers to the mean flow, with the magnitude of momentum fluxes compliant with the observed values. The eddy activity is not regularly distributed with time, but appears as bursts; both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities could play a role in the eddy activity. The steady-state latitude of occurrence of jets is controlled by poleward migration during the spin-up of our model. At the equator, a weakly-superrotating tropospheric jet and vertically-stacked alternating stratospheric jets are obtained in our GCM simulations. The model produces Yanai (Rossby-gravity), Rossby and Kelvin waves at the equator, as well as extratropical Rossby waves, and large-scale vortices in polar regions. Challenges remain to reproduce Saturn's powerful superrotating jet and hexagon-shaped circumpolar jet in the troposphere, and downward-propagating equatorial oscillation in the stratosphere.","Aymeric Spiga, Sandrine Guerlet, Ehouarn Millour, Mikel Indurain, Yann Meurdesoif, Simon Cabanes, Thomas Dubos, Jérémy Leconte, Alexandre Boissinot, Sébastien Lebonnois, Mélody Sylvestre, Thierry Fouchet","68 pages, 23 figures, revised version submitted to Icarus on May 24th

This approach requires high (mountain) altitudes and very high surface coverage particle detectors. While in general the properties of air showers are well established for many decades, the extreme situation of ground-level detection of very small showers from low energy primaries has not yet been well characterised for the purposes of gamma-ray astronomy. Here we attempt such a characterisation, with the aim of supporting the optimisation of next-generation gamma-ray observatories based on this technique. We address all of the key ground level observables and provide parameterisations for use in detector optimisation for shower energies around 1 TeV.

990,"We study unimodular gravity in the context of cosmology, particularly some interesting consequences that might be able to describe the background cosmology and the late cosmic acceleration. We focus our attention on the hypothesis of \textit{non conservation of the energy momentum tensor}. This characteristic has an interesting outcome: we can obtain a modified Friedmann equation along with the acceleration equation and also new fluid equations related to a third order derivative of the scale factor, known in cosmography as the jerk parameter. As a consequence of this theory, it seems that radiation and the cosmological constant are intimately related, in agreement with what some authors have called the third coincidence problem. Their connection is the parameter $z_{ini}$, which has a value of $11.29$ and coincide with the reionization epoch. As a result, we are able to explain the late acceleration as a natural consequence of the equations, associating the new fluid to radiation and, thus, eliminating the need for another component (i.e. dark energy). Finally, we interpret the results and discuss the pros and cons of using the cosmological constant under the hypothesis of non conservation of the energy momentum tensor in the unimodular gravity scenario.","Miguel A.

991,"In this paper,we report a detailed analysis of recurrent jets originated from a location with emerging, canceling and converging negative magnetic field at the east edge of NOAA active region AR11166 from 2011 March 09 to 10. The event presented several interesting features. First, a satellite sunspot appeared and collided with a pre-existing opposite polarity magnetic field and caused a recurrent solar jet event. Second, the evolution of the jets showed blowout-like nature and standard characteristics. Third, the satellite sunspot exhibited a motion toward southeast of AR11166 and merged with the emerging flux near the opposite polarity sunspot penumbra, which afterward, due to flux convergence and cancellation episodes, caused recurrent jets. Fourth, three of the blowout jets associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), were observed from field of view of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. Fifth, almost all the blowout jet eruptions were accompanied with flares or with more intense brightening in the jet base region, while almost standard jets did not manifest such obvious feature during eruptions. The most important, the blowout jets were inclined to faster and larger scale than the standard jets. The standard jets instead were inclined to relative longer-lasting. The obvious shearing and twisting motions of the magnetic field may be interpreted as due to the shearing and twisting motions for a blowout jet eruption. From the statistical results, about 30% blowout jets directly developed into CMEs. It suggests that the blowout jets and CMEs should have a tight relationship.","Yuhu Miao, Y. Liu, Y. D. Shen, A.

993,"This work extends previous kinematic studies of young stars in the Head of the Orion A cloud (OMC-1/2/3/4/5). It is based on large samples of infrared, optical, and X-ray selected pre-main sequence stars with reliable radial velocities and Gaia-derived parallaxes and proper motions. Stellar kinematic groups are identified assuming they mimic the motion of their parental gas. Several groups are found to have peculiar kinematics: the NGC 1977 cluster and two stellar groups in the Extended Orion Nebula (EON) cavity are caught in the act of departing their birthplaces. The abnormal motion of NGC 1977 may have been caused by a global hierarchical cloud collapse, feedback by massive Ori OB1ab stars, supersonic turbulence, cloud-cloud collision, and/or slingshot effect; the former two models are favored by us. EON groups might have inherited anomalous motions of their parental cloudlets due to small-scale `rocket effects' from nearby OB stars. We also identify sparse stellar groups to the east and west of Orion A that are drifting from the central region, possibly a slowly expanding halo of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We confirm previously reported findings of varying line-of-sight distances to different parts of the cloud's Head with associated differences in gas velocity. Three-dimensional movies of star kinematics show contraction of the groups of stars in OMC-1 and global contraction of OMC-123 stars.

994,"We investigate the impact of a solid-body rotation $\Omega_0$ on the large-scale dynamics of an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulent flow in presence of a background magnetic field $\bf B_0$ and at low Rossby number. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed in a periodic box, at unit magnetic Prandtl number and with a forcing at intermediate wavenumber $k_f=20$. When $\Omega_0$ is aligned with $\bf B_0$ (i.e. $\theta \equiv \widehat{\left(\Omega_{0}, \bf B_0 \right)} = 0$), inverse transfer is found for the magnetic spectrum at $k<k_f$. This transfer is stronger when the forcing excites preferentially right-handed (rather than left-handed) fluctuations; it is smaller when $\theta>0$ and becomes weak when $\theta \ge 35^o$. These properties are understood as the consequence of an inverse cascade of hybrid helicity which is an inviscid/ideal invariant of this system when $\theta=0$. Hybrid helicity emerges, therefore, as a key element for understanding rotating dynamos. Implication of these findings on the origin of the alignment of the magnetic dipole with the rotation axis in planets and stars is discussed.","Mélissa D.

995,"Terzan 5 is the only Galactic globular cluster that has plausibly been detected at very-high energies by the High Energy Stereoscopic System. It has an unexpectedly asymmetric very-high-energy morphology that is offset from the cluster center, in addition to a large-scale, offset radio structure and compact diffuse X-ray emission associated with this cluster. We present new data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on this source. We model the updated broadband spectral energy distribution, attributing this to cumulative pulsed emission from a population of embedded millisecond pulsars as well as unpulsed emission from the interaction of their leptonic winds with the ambient magnetic and soft-photon fields. In particular, our model invokes unpulsed synchrotron and inverse Compton components to model the radio and TeV data, cumulative pulsed curvature radiation to fit the Fermi data, and explains the hard Chandra X-ray spectrum via a ""new"" cumulative synchrotron component from electron-positron pairs within the pulsar magnetospheres that has not been implemented before. We find reasonable spectral fits for plausible model parameters. We also derive constraints on the millisecond pulsar luminosity function using the diffuse X-ray data and the Chandra sensitivity. Future higher-quality spectral and spatial data will help discriminate between competing scenarios (such as dark matter annihilation, white dwarf winds or hadronic interactions) proposed for the broadband emission as well as constrain degenerate model parameters.","Hambeleleni Ndiyavala, Christo Venter, Tyrel J.

996,"Accurate estimation of the Hubble constant, and other cosmological parameters, from distances measured by cosmic gravitational wave sirens requires sufficient allowance for the dark energy evolution. We demonstrate how model independent statistical methods, specifically Gaussian process regression, can remove bias in the reconstruction of $H(z)$, and can be combined model independently with supernova distances. This allows stringent tests of both $H_0$ and $\Lambda$CDM, and can detect unrecognized systematics. We also quantify the redshift systematic control necessary for the use of dark sirens, showing that it must approach spectroscopic precision to avoid significant bias.","Ryan E.

997,"Neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei is currently the only known potentially viable method of detection of cosmic background neutrinos. It is based on the idea of separation of the spectra of electrons or positrons produced in captures of relic neutrinos on unstable nuclei from those from the usual $\beta$-decay and requires very high energy resolution of the detector, comparable to the neutrino mass. In this paper we suggest an alternative method of discrimination between neutrino capture and $\beta$-decay, based on periodic variations of angular correlations in inverse beta decay transitions induced by relic neutrino capture. The time variations are expected to arise due to the peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\nu$B rest frame and the rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution of detection of the produced $\beta$-particles and can be operative even if this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.",Evgeny Akhmedov,"27 pages, 1 figure",1905.10207v1,No journal ref found,Evgeny Akhmedov,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10207v1,2019-05-24 12:53:15+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-ex|nucl-ex,C$ν$B detection through angular correlations in inverse $β$-decay,2019-05-24 12:53:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10207v1
998,"We explore the implications of a rapid appearance of dark energy between the redshifts ($z$) of one and two on the expansion rate and growth of perturbations. Using both Gaussian process regression and a parameteric model, we show that this is the preferred solution to the current set of low-redshift ($z<3$) distance measurements if $H_0=73~\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ to within 1\% and the high-redshift expansion history is unchanged from the $\Lambda$CDM inference by the Planck satellite. Dark energy was effectively non-existent around $z=2$, but its density is close to the $\Lambda$CDM model value today, with an equation of state greater than $-1$ at $z<0.5$. If sources of clustering other than matter are negligible, we show that this expansion history leads to slower growth of perturbations at $z<1$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, that is measurable by upcoming surveys and can alleviate the $\sigma_8$ tension between the Planck CMB temperature and low-redshift probes of the large-scale structure.","Ryan E.

999,"We have conducted a large-field simultaneous survey of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O $J=1-0$ emission toward the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant (SNR), which covers a sky area of $3.5^{\circ}\times3.1^{\circ}$. The Cas giant molecular cloud (GMC) mainly consists of three individual clouds with masses on the order of $10^4-10^5\ M_{\odot}$. The total mass derived from the $\rm{^{13}CO}$ emission of the GMC is 2.1$\times10^{5}\ M_{\odot}$ and is 9.5$\times10^5\ M_{\odot}$ from the $\rm{^{12}CO}$ emission. Two regions with broadened (6$-$7 km s$^{-1}$) or asymmetric $^{12}$CO line profiles are found in the vicinity (within a 10$'\times10'$ region) of the Cas A SNR, indicating possible interactions between the SNR and the GMC. Using the GAUSSCLUMPS algorithm, 547 $^{13}$CO clumps are identified in the GMC, 54$\%$ of which are supercritical (i.e. $\alpha_{\rm{vir}}<2$). The mass spectrum of the molecular clumps follows a power-law distribution with an exponent of $-2.20$. The pixel-by-pixel column density of the GMC can be fitted with a log-normal probability distribution function (N-PDF). The median column density of molecular hydrogen in the GMC is $1.6\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and half the mass of the GMC is contained in regions with H$_2$ column density lower than $3\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is well below the threshold of star formation. The distribution of the YSO candidates in the region shows no agglomeration.","Yuehui Ma, Hongchi Wang, Miaomiao Zhang, Chong Li, Ji Yang","24 pages, 18 figures",1905.10193v1,No journal ref found,Ji Yang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10193v1,2019-05-24 12:36:05+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.SR,A Large-field J=1-0 Survey of CO and Its Isotopologues Toward the   Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant,2019-05-24 12:36:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10193v1

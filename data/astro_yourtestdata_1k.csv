0,"The mass evolution of protoplanetary disks is driven by both internal processes and external factors, such as photoevaporation. Disentangling these two effects, however, has remained difficult. We measure the dust masses of a sample of 132 disks in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC)-2 region, and compare them to (i) externally photoevaporated disks in the Trapezium cluster, and (ii) disks in nearby low-mass star forming regions (SFRs). This allows us to test if initial disk properties are the same in high- and low-mass SFRs, and enables a direct measurement of the effect of external photoevaporation on disks. A ~ $20' \times 4'$ mosaic of 3 mm continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) was used to measure the fluxes of 132 disks and 35 protostars >0.5 pc away from the Trapezium. We identify and characterize a sample of 34 point sources not included in the Spitzer catalog on which the sample is based. Of the disks, 37 (28%) are detected, with masses ranging from 7-270 M_e. The detection rate for protostars is higher at 69%. Disks near the Trapezium are found to be less massive by a factor $0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$, implying a mass loss rate of $8\times10^{-8}$ M_sun/yr. Our observations allow us to distinguish the impact of time and environment on disk evolution in a single SFR. The disk mass distribution in OMC-2 is statistically indistinguishable from that in nearby low-mass SFRs, like Lupus and Taurus. We conclude that age is the main factor determining the evolution of these disks. This result is robust with respect to assumptions of dust temperature, sample incompleteness and biases. The difference between the OMC-2 and Trapezium cluster samples is consistent with mass loss driven by far-ultraviolet radiation near the Trapezium. Together, this implies that in isolation, disk formation and evolution proceed similarly, regardless of cloud mass.","Sierk.

1,"We outline a simple procedure designed for \emph{automatically} finding sets of multiple images in strong lensing (SL) clusters. We show that by combining (a) an arc-finding (or source extracting) program, (b) photometric redshift measurements, and (c) a preliminary light-traces-mass lens model, multiple-image systems can be identified in a fully automated (`blind') manner. The presented procedure yields an assessment of the likelihood of each arc to belong to one of the multiple-image systems, as well as the preferred redshift for the different systems. These could be then used to automatically constrain and refine the initial lens model for an accurate mass distribution. We apply this procedure to \emph{Cluster Lensing And Supernova with Hubble} observations of three galaxy clusters, MACS J0329.6-0211, MACS J1720.2+3536, and MACS J1931.8-2635, comparing the results to published SL analyses where multiple images were verified by eye on a particular basis. In the first cluster all originally identified systems are recovered by the automated procedure, and in the second and third clusters about half are recovered. Other known systems are not picked up, in part due to a crude choice of parameters, ambiguous photometric redshifts, or inaccuracy of the initial lens model. On top of real systems recovered, some false images are also mistakenly identified by the procedure, depending on the thresholds used. While further improvements to the procedure and a more thorough scrutinisation of its performance are warranted, the work constitutes another important step toward fully automatising SL analyses for studying mass distributions of large cluster samples.","Mauricio Carrasco, Adi Zitrin, Gregor Seidel","16 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables.

2,"We present and apply Gaussbock, a new embarrassingly parallel iterative algorithm for cosmological parameter estimation designed for an era of cheap parallel computing resources. Gaussbock uses Bayesian nonparametrics and truncated importance sampling to accurately draw samples from posterior distributions with an orders-of-magnitude speed-up in wall time over alternative methods. Contemporary problems in this area often suffer from both increased computational costs due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and consequent excessive time requirements, as well as the need for fine tuning of proposal distributions or sampling parameters. Gaussbock is designed specifically with these issues in mind. We explore and validate the performance and convergence of the algorithm on a fast approximation to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) posterior, finding reasonable scaling behavior with the number of parameters. We then test on the full DES Y1 posterior using large-scale supercomputing facilities, and recover reasonable agreement with previous chains, although the algorithm can underestimate the tails of poorly-constrained parameters. In addition, we provide the community with a user-friendly software tool for accelerated cosmological parameter estimation based on the methodology described in this paper.","Ben Moews, Joe Zuntz","17 pages, 7 figures, preprint to be submitted to ApJ",1905.09800v1,No journal ref found,Joe Zuntz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09800v1,2019-05-23 17:50:04+00:00,astro-ph.CO,"astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.IM|stat.CO|stat.ME|85A40, 68W10, 62G07, 62P35",Gaussbock: Fast parallel-iterative cosmological parameter estimation   with Bayesian nonparametrics,2019-05-23 17:50:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09800v1
3,"We investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the high-mass star forming region NGC 7538-IRS1. We have carried out a multi-transition study of CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and of the deuterated fllavors, CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD, between 1.0--1.4 mm with the IRAM-30~m antenna. In total, 34 $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, 13 CH$_2$DOH lines and 20 CH$_3$OD lines spanning a wide range of upper-state energies (E$_{up}$) were detected. From the detected transitions, we estimate that the measured D/H does not exceed 1$\%$, with a measured CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$OD/CH$_3$OH of about (32$\pm$8)$\times$10$^{-4}$ and (10$\pm$4)$\times$10$^{-4}$, respectively. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of a short-time scale formation during the pre-stellar phase. We find a relative abundance ratio CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD of 3.2 $\pm$ 1.5. This result is consistent with a statistical deuteration. We cannot exclude H/D exchanges between water and methanol if water deuteration is of the order 0.1$\%$, as suggested by recent Herschel observations.","Juan Ospina-Zamudio, CÃ©cile Favre, Marina Kounkel, Li-Hong Xu, Justin Neill, Bertrand Lefloch, Alexandre Faure, Edwin Bergin, Davide Fedele, Lee Hartmann",Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics,1905.09798v1,No journal ref found,Lee Hartmann,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09798v1,2019-05-23 17:43:20+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Deuterated methanol toward NGC 7538-IRS1,2019-05-23 17:43:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09798v1
4,"We present the first radio polarimetric observations of a fast-rising blue optical transient, AT2018cow. Two epochs of polarimetry with additional coincident photometry were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The overall photometric results based on simultaneous observations in the 100 and 230 GHz bands are consistent with the non-thermal radiation model reported by Ho et al. (2019) and indicate that the spectral peaks ($\sim110$ GHz at the first epoch and $\sim67$ GHz at the second epoch) represent the synchrotron self-absorption frequency. The non-detection of linear polarization with $<$0.15% in the 230 GHz band at the phase when the effect of synchrotron self-absorption was quite small in the band may be explained by internal Faraday depolarization with high circumburst density and strong magnetic field. This result supports the stellar explosion scenario rather than the tidal disruption model. The maximum energy of accelerating particles at the shocks of AT2018cow-like objects is also discussed.","K. Y. Huang, J. Shimoda, Y. Urata, K. Toma, K. Yamaoka, K. Asada, H. Nagai, S. Takahashi, G.

5,"We present rapid, multiwavelength photometry of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1357.2-0933 during its 2017 outburst. Using several sets of quasi-simultaneous ULTRACAM/NTT (optical), NuSTAR (X-ray), XRT/Swift (X-ray), SALT (optical) and ATCA (radio) observations taken during outburst decline, we confirm the frequent optical dipping that has previously been noted both in outburst and in quiescence. We also find: 1) that the dip frequency decreases as the outburst decays, similar to what was seen in the previous outburst, 2) that the dips produce a shape similar to that in binary systems with partial disc occultations, 3) that the source becomes significantly bluer during these dips, indicating an unusual geometry compared to other LMXB dippers, and 4) that dip superposition analysis confirms the lack of an X-ray response to the optical dips. These very unusual properties appear to be unique to Swift J1357.2-0933, and are likely the result of a high binary inclination, as inferred from features such as its very low outburst X-ray luminosity. From this analysis as well as X-ray/optical timing correlations, we suggest a model with multi-component emission/absorption features with differing colours. This could include the possible presence of a sporadically occulted jet base and a recessed disc. This source still hosts many puzzling features, with consequences for the very faint X-ray transients population.","J. A. Paice, P. Gandhi, P. A. Charles, V. S. Dhillon, T. R. Marsh, D. A. H.

6,"We present an analysis of several Hinode EIS observations of coronal line widths in the quiet Sun, up to 1.5 Rsun radial distances. No significant variations are found, which indicates no damping of Alfv\'en waves in the quiescent corona.   However, the uncertainties in estimating the instrumental width mean that a firm conclusion cannot be reached. We present a discussion of various EIS instrumental issues and suggest that the strongest lines, from Fe XII at 193.5 and 195.1 A, have anomalous instrumental widths. We show how line widths in EIS are uncertain when the signal is low, and that the instrumental variation along the slit is also uncertain. We also found an anomalous decrease (up to 40%) in the intensities of these lines in many off-limb and active region observations, and suggest that this is due to opacity effects. We find that the most reliable measurements are obtained from the weaker lines.","G. Del Zanna, G. R. Gupta, H. E.

7,"We present the first determination of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from strong lensing time delay data and type Ia supernova luminosity distances that is independent of the cosmological model. We also determine the spatial curvature model-independently. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the FLRW metric and geometrical optics holds, but make no assumption about the contents of the Universe or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. We find $H_0=75.7^{+4.5}_{-4.4}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Omega_{K0}=0.12^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$. This is a 6\% determination of $H_0$. A weak prior from the cosmic microwave background on the distance to the last scattering surface improves this to $H_0=76.8^{+4.2}_{-3.8}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Omega_{K0}=0.18^{+0.25}_{-0.18}$. Assuming zero spatial curvature, we get $H_0=74.2^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/s/Mpc, a precision of $4\%$. The measurements also provide a consistency test of the FLRW metric: we find no evidence against it.","Thomas Collett, Francesco Montanari, Syksy Rasanen","7 pages, 1 figure",1905.09781v1,No journal ref found,Syksy Rasanen,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09781v1,2019-05-23 17:12:01+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Model-independent determination of $H_0$ and $Î©_{K0}$ from strong   lensing and type Ia supernovae,2019-05-23 17:12:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09781v1
8,"An observer stationary with respect to the comoving coordinates of the expanding universe should find the redshift distribution to be isotropic. However, a peculiar motion of the observer would introduce a dipole anisotropy in the observed redshift distribution. In return, a dipole anisotropy in the observed redshift distribution could be exploited to infer a peculiar motion of the solar system, We determine the peculiar velocity of the solar system by studying the dipole anisotropy in the redshift distribution of a large sample of quasars. The magnitude of the peculiar velocity thus determined turns out be $3200\pm400$ km s$^{-1}$, not only much larger than 370 km s$^{-1}$ determined from the dipole anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), but also nearly in an opposite direction. Such large values for peculiar velocity have been found in a couple of radio surveys too, but with a direction along the CMBR dipole. Large genuine differences in the inferred motion, whether in magnitude or direction, are rather disconcerting since a solar peculiar velocity should not depend upon the exact technique of its determination. Such discordant dipoles imply perhaps an anisotropic universe, violating the cosmological principle, a cornerstone of the modern cosmology.",Ashok K.

9,"We analyze the intriguing possibility to explain both dark mass components in a galaxy: the dark matter (DM) halo and the supermassive dark compact object lying at the center, by a unified approach in terms of a quasi-relaxed system of massive, neutral fermions in general relativity. The solutions to the mass distribution of such a model that fulfill realistic halo boundary conditions inferred from observations, develop a highly-density core supported by the fermion degeneracy pressure able to mimic massive black holes at the center of galaxies. Remarkably, these dense core-diluted halo configurations can explain the dynamics of the closest stars around Milky Way's center (SgrA*) all the way to the halo rotation curve, without spoiling the baryonic bulge-disk components, for a narrow particle mass range $mc^2 \sim 10$-$10^2$~keV.","C.

10,"Thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) is a fascinating situation that occurs in coronal magnetic flux tubes (loops) for which no solution to the steady-state fluid equations exists. The plasma is constantly evolving even though the heating that produces the hot temperatures does not. This is the likely explanation of isolated phenomena such as prominences, coronal rain, and long-period pulsating loops, but it may also have much broader relevance. As known for some time, TNE requires that the heating be both (quasi) steady and concentrated at low coronal altitudes. Recent studies indicate that asymmetries are also important, with large enough asymmetries in the heating and/or cross-sectional area resulting in steady flow rather than TNE. Using reasonable approximations, we have derived two formulae for quantifying the conditions necessary for TNE. As a rough rule of thumb, the ratio of apex to footpoint heating must be less than about 0.1, and asymmetries must be less than about a factor of 3. The precise values are case dependent. We have tested our formulae with 1D hydrodynamic loop simulations and find a very acceptable agreement. These results are important for developing physical insight about TNE and assessing how widespread it may be on the Sun.","James A.

11,"The sensitivity of radial velocity (RV) surveys for exoplanet detection are extending to increasingly long orbital periods, where companions with periods of several years are now being regularly discovered. Companions with orbital periods that exceed the duration of the survey manifest in the data as an incomplete orbit or linear trend, a feature that can either present as the sole detectable companion to the host star, or as an additional signal overlain on the signatures of previously discovered companion(s). A diagnostic that can confirm or constrain scenarios in which the trend is caused by an unseen stellar, rather than planetary, companion is the use of high-contrast imaging observations. Here, we present RV data from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) for twenty stars that show evidence of orbiting companions. Of these, six companions have resolved orbits, with three that lie in the planetary regime. Two of these (HD~92987b and HD~221420b) are new discoveries. Follow-up observations using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the Gemini South telescope revealed that five of the twenty monitored companions are likely stellar in nature. We use the sensitivity of the AAPS and DSSI data to place constraints on the mass of the companions for the remaining systems. Our analysis shows that a planetary-mass companion provides the most likely self-consistent explanation of the data for many of the remaining systems.","Stephen R. Kane, Paul A.

12,"A fundamental property of the Standard Model is that the Higgs potential becomes unstable at large values of the Higgs field. For the current central values of the Higgs and top masses, the instability scale is about $10^{11}$ GeV and therefore not accessible by colliders. We show that a possible signature of the Standard Model Higgs instability is the production of gravitational waves sourced by Higgs fluctuations generated during inflation. We fully characterise the two-point correlator of such gravitational waves by computing its amplitude, the frequency at peak, the spectral index, as well as their three-point correlators for various polarisations. We show that, depending on the Higgs and top masses, either LISA or the Einstein Telescope and Advanced-Ligo, could detect such stochastic background of gravitational waves. In this sense, collider and gravitational wave physics can provide fundamental and complementary informations. Furthermore, the consistency relation among the three- and the two-point correlators could provide an efficient tool to ascribe the detected gravitational waves to the Standard Model itself. Since the mechanism described in this paper might also be responsible for the generation of dark matter under the form of primordial black holes, this latter hypothesis may find its confirmation through the detection of gravitational waves.","JosÃ© RamÃ³n Espinosa, Davide Racco, Antonio Riotto","17+7 pages, 12 figures. v2: corrected an error in the numerical

13,"We show that the recently discovered binary 2M05215658+4359220 (2M0521), comprised of a giant star (GS) orbiting a suspected black hole (BH) in a ~80 day orbit, may be instrumental in shedding light on uncertain BH-formation physics and can be a test case for studying wind accretion models. Using binary population synthesis with a realistic prescription for the star formation history and metallicity evolution of the Milky Way, we analyze the evolution of binaries containing compact objects (COs) in orbit around GSs with properties similar to 2M0521. We find ~100-1000 CO-GS binaries in the Milky Way observable by Gaia, and 0-12 BH-GS and 0-1 neutron star-GS binaries in the Milky Way with properties similar to 2M0521. We find that all CO-GSs with Porb<5 yr, including 2M0521, go through a common envelope (CE) and hence form a class of higher mass analogs to white dwarf post-CE binaries. We further show how the component masses of 2M0521-like binaries depend strongly on the supernova-engine model we adopt. Thus, an improved measurement of the orbit of 2M0521, imminent with Gaia's third data release, will strongly constrain its component masses and as a result inform supernova-engine models widely used in binary population synthesis studies. These results have widespread implications for the origins and properties of CO binaries, especially those detectable by LIGO and LISA. Finally, we show that the reported X-ray non-detection of 2M0521 is a challenge for wind accretion theory, making 2M0521-like CO-GS binaries a prime target for further study with accretion models.","Katelyn Breivik, Sourav Chatterjee, Jeff J.

14,"We study the covariance in the angular power spectrum estimates of CMB fluctuations when the primordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussian covariance comes from a nonzero connected four-point correlation function --- or the trispectrum in Fourier space --- and can be large when long-wavelength (super-CMB) modes are strongly coupled to short-wavelength modes. The effect of such non-Gaussian covariance can be modeled through additional freedom in the theoretical CMB angular power spectrum and can lead to different inferred values of the standard cosmological parameters relative to those in $\Lambda$CDM. Taking the collapsed limit of the primordial trispectrum in the quasi-single field inflation model as an example, we study how the six standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters shift when two additional parameters describing the trispectrum are allowed. We find that the combination of Planck temperature data along with type Ia supernovae from Panstarrs and the distance-ladder measurement of the Hubble constant shows strong evidence for a primordial trispectrum-induced non-Gaussian covariance, with a likelihood improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 \approx -15$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The improvement is driven by Planck data's preference for a higher lensing amplitude, which leads to an upward shift of the Planck-inferred Hubble constant.","Saroj Adhikari, Dragan Huterer","5 pages, 2 figures; v2: small text changes for improved discussion",1905.02278v2,No journal ref found,Dragan Huterer,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02278v2,2019-05-06 22:08:02+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-th,Super-CMB fluctuations can resolve the Hubble tension,2019-05-23 15:48:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02278v2
15,"This paper provides long-period and revised orbits for barium and S stars adding to previously published ones. The sample of barium stars with strong anomalies comprise all such stars present in the Lu et al. catalogue. We find orbital motion for all barium and extrinsic S stars monitored. We obtain the longest period known so far for a spectroscopic binary involving an S star, namely 57 Peg with a period of the order of 100 - 500 yr. We present the mass distribution for the barium stars, which ranges from 1 to 3 Msun, with a tail extending up to 5 Msun in the case of mild barium stars. This high-mass tail comprises mostly high-metallicity objects ([Fe/H] >= -0.1). Mass functions are compatible with WD companions and we derive their mass distribution which ranges from 0.5 to 1 Msun. Using the initial - final mass relationship established for field WDs, we derived the distribution of the mass ratio q' = MAGB,ini / MBa (where MAGB, ini is the WD progenitor initial mass, i.e., the mass of the system former primary component) which is a proxy for the initial mass ratio. It appears that the distribution of q' is highly non uniform, and significantly different for mild and strong barium stars, the latter being characterized by values mostly in excess of 1.4, whereas mild barium stars occupy the range 1 - 1.4. We investigate as well the correlation between abundances, orbital periods, metallicities, and masses (barium star and WD companion).

16,"We report the confirmation of an old, metal-poor globular cluster in the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A, the first globular cluster known in this galaxy. The cluster, which we designate as Sextans A-GC1, lies some 4.4 arcminutes ($\sim1.8$ kpc) to the SW of the galaxy centre and clearly resolves into stars in sub-arcsecond seeing ground-based imaging.We measure an integrated magnitude $V=18.04$, corresponding to an absolute magnitude, $M_{V,0} = -7.85$. This gives an inferred mass $M\sim$1.6$\times10^5~M\odot$, assuming a Kroupa IMF. An integrated spectrum of Sextans A-GC1 reveals a heliocentric radial velocity $v_{\rm helio}=305\pm15$~ km/s, consistent with the systemic velocity of Sextans A. The location of candidate red giant branch stars in the cluster, and stellar population analyses of the cluster's integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] $\sim$--2.4, and an age $\sim9$ Gyr. We measure a half light radius, $R_h = 7.6\pm0.2$ pc. Normalising to the galaxy integrated magnitude, we obtain a $V$-band specific frequency, $S_N=2.1$. We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1 is close to a ""metallicity floor"" at [Fe/H] $\sim-2.5$ seen in these globular cluster systems which include the Milky Way, M31, M87 and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This metallicity floor appears to hold across 6 dex in host galaxy stellar mass and is seen in galaxies with and without accreted GC subpopulations.","Michael A.

17,"We present different signatures of chromospheric evaporation in two solar flares observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). In the B1.6 flare on 2016 December 6 (SOL2016-12-06T10:40), the transition region Si IV line and the chromospheric C II and Mg II lines show blueshifts with low velocities up to 20 km/s at the flare loop footpoints in the rise phase, indicative of a gentle chromospheric evaporation. While in the C1.6 flare on 2015 December 19 (SOL2015-12-19T10:51), the Si IV, C II, and Mg II lines exhibit redshifts with velocities from several to tens of km/s at the footpoints, which might suggest an explosive chromospheric evaporation. Explosive evaporation has been observed in many flares that were captured by IRIS; however, gentle evaporation, especially manifested as blueshifts in the cool Si IV, C II, and Mg II lines, has scarcely been reported. Our results bring some new insights into chromospheric evaporation in the IRIS era.","Y. Li, M. D. Ding, J. Hong, H. Li, W. Q. Gan",ApJ accepted.

18,"New determinations are presented of the cosmic infrared background monopole brightness in the Planck HFI bands from 100 GHz to 857 GHz. Planck was not designed to measure the monopole component of sky brightness, so cross-correlation of the 2015 HFI maps with COBE/FIRAS data is used to recalibrate the zero level of the HFI maps. For the HFI 545 and 857 GHz maps, the brightness scale is also recalibrated. Correlation of the recalibrated HFI maps with a linear combination of Galactic H I and H alpha data is used to separate the Galactic foreground emission and determine the cosmic infrared background brightness in each of the HFI bands. We obtain CIB values of 0.007 +- 0.014, 0.010 +- 0.019, 0.060 +- 0.023, 0.149 +- 0.017, 0.371 +- 0.018, and 0.576 +- 0.034 MJy/sr at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 GHz, respectively. The estimated uncertainties for the 353 to 857 GHz bands are about 3 to 6 times smaller than those of previous direct CIB determinations at these frequencies. Our results are compared with integrated source brightness results from selected recent submillimeter and millimeter wavelength imaging surveys.","N. Odegard, J. L. Weiland, D. J. Fixsen, D. T.

19,"Model-independent estimates of cosmological quantities are a challenge for observational cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a model-independent way to obtain the present dark matter density parameter ($\Omega_{\rm{c,0}}$) by combining gas mass fraction measurements in galaxy clusters ($f_{gas}$), type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations and measurements of the cosmic baryon abundance from observations of absorption systems at high redshifts. Our estimate is $\Omega_{\rm{c,0}} = 0.241 \pm 0.012$ ($1\sigma$). By considering the latest local measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 74.03 \pm 1.42$ (1$\sigma$), we obtain $\Omega_{\rm{M,0}} = 0.282 \pm 0.012$ ($1\sigma$) for the total matter density parameter. We also investigate departures of the evolution of the dark matter density with respect to the usual $a^{-3}$ scaling, as usual in interacting models of dark matter and dark energy. As the current data cannot confirm or rule out such an interaction, we perform a forecast analysis to estimate the necessary improvements in number and accuracy of upcoming $f_{gas}$ and SNe Ia observations to detect a possible non-minimal coupling in the cosmological dark sector.","R.

20,"One of the main science goals of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is to uncover the nature of cosmic acceleration. In the base analysis, possible deviations from the Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) background evolution will be probed by fitting a $w(z)$CDM model, which allows for a redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state with $w(z)$, within general relativity (GR). A rich array of other phenomena can arise due to deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM+GR model though, including modifications to the growth rate of structure and lensing, and novel screening effects on non-linear scales. Concrete physical models are needed to provide consistent predictions for these (potentially small) effects, to give us the best chance of detecting them and separating them from astrophysical systematics. A complex plethora of possible models has been constructed over the past few decades, with none emerging as a particular favorite. This document prioritizes a subset of these models along with rationales for further study and inclusion into the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) data analysis pipelines, based on their observational viability, theoretical plausibility, and level of theoretical development. We provide references and theoretical expressions to aid the integration of these models into DESC software and simulations, and give justifications for why other models were not prioritized. While DESC efforts are free to pursue other models, we provide here guidelines on which theories appear to have higher priority for collaboration efforts due to their perceived promise and greater instructional value.","Mustapha Ishak, Tessa Baker, Philip Bull, Eske M.

21,"The discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant indicates new physics in dark energy, dark matter, or both. Drawing inspiration from string theory, where axions interact with the other moduli fields, including the dilaton, here we demonstrate that the dynamics of an interacting dilaton and axion naturally realizes the proposal of Early Dark Energy. In this setup, stabilization of the the dilaton is in part due to the axion, and in the early universe the dilaton contributes to dark energy. The combined axion-dilaton system is destabilized when the Hubble constant falls below the mass of the axion, triggering a phase of fast-roll evolution of the dilaton wherein its equation of state is $w=1$, and the early dark energy redshifts away as $a^{-6}$.","Stephon Alexander, Evan McDonough","v1: 4 pages, 2 figures. v2: references added. v3: more references

We calculate the angular clustering of supernova magnitude residuals and compare it to the noise expected under the isotropic assumption. We also test for systematic effects and demonstrate that their effects are negligible or are already accounted for in our procedure. We express our constraints as an upper limit on the rms spatial variation in the Hubble parameter at late times.

23,"We calculate X-ray signal that should arise due to reflection of the putative collimated X-ray emission of the Galactic supercritical accretor SS 433 on molecular clouds in its vicinity. The molecular gas distribution in the region of interest has been constructed based on the data of the BU-FCRAO GRS in $^{13}$CO $J=1\rightarrow0$ emission line, while the collimated emission was assumed to be aligned with the direction of the relativistic jets, which are continuously launched by the system. We consider all the available $Chandra$ observations covering the regions possibly containing the reflection signal and put constraints on the apparent face-on luminosity of SS 433 above 4 keV. No signatures of the predicted signal have been found in the analysed regions down to a 4-8 keV surface brightness level of $\sim 10^{-11}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/deg$^2$. This translates into the limit on the apparent face-on 2-10 keV luminosity of SS 433 $L_{X,2-10}\lesssim 8\times10^{38}$ erg/s, provided that the considered clouds do fall inside the illumination cone of the collimated emission. This, however, might not be the case due to persisting uncertainty in the line-of-sight distances to SS 433 $d_{SS433}$ (4.5-5.5 kpc) and to the considered molecular clouds. For half-opening angle of the collimation cone larger than or comparable to the amplitude of the jets' precession ($\approx21\deg$), the stringent upper limit quoted above is most relevant if $d_{SS433}<5$ kpc, provided that the kinematic distances to the considered molecular clouds are sufficiently accurate. Dropping the last assumption, a more conservative constraint is $L_{X,2-10}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg/s for $d_{SS433}=4.65-4.85$ kpc (and yet worse outside this range). We conclude that SS 433 is not likely to belong to the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources if it could be observed face-on, unless its X-ray emission is highly collimated. (Abridged)","I.

24,"The dark matter in or around the cosmic voids affects their shapes. The thermodynamical properties of dark matter can alter the ellipticity of cosmic voids. Here, applying the dark matter equation of state from the pseudo-isothermal density profile of galaxies, we explore the shapes of cosmic voids with the non zero pressure dark matter in different cosmological models. For this purpose, the linear growth of density perturbation in the presence of dark matter pressure is calculated. In addition, the matter transfer function considering the dark matter pressure, as well as the linear matter power spectrum in the presence of the dark matter pressure are presented. Employing these results, the probability density distribution for the ellipticity of cosmic voids with the non zero pressure dark matter is calculated.

25,"During the in-spiral stage of a compact binary, a wind bubble could be blown into interstellar medium, if the electromagnetic radiation due to the binary orbital motion is strong enough. Therefore, short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) due to double neutron star mergers would in principle happen in a wind bubble environment, which can influence the propagation of the SGRB jet and the consequent afterglow emission. By calculating the dynamics and synchrotron radiation of the jet-driven external shock, we reveal that an abrupt jump could appear in the afterglow light curves of SGRBs and the observational time of the jump is dependent on the viewing angle. This light curve jump provides an observational signature to constrain the radius of the wind bubble and then the power of the binary electromagnetic radiation, by combining with gravitational wave detection.","Yong-Sen Li, Aming Chen, Yun-Wei Yu","8 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in RAA",1905.09663v1,No journal ref found,Yun-Wei Yu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09663v1,2019-05-23 13:59:31+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Observational signature of a wind bubble environment for double neutron   star mergers,2019-05-23 13:59:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09663v1
26,"Context. Solar activity is often accompanied by solar radio emission, consisting of numerous types of solar radio bursts. At low frequencies (<100 MHz) radio bursts with short durations of milliseconds, such as solar S-bursts, have been identified. To date, their origin and many of their characteristics remain unclear. Aims. We report observations from the Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, (UTR-2), and the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) which give us new insight into their nature. Methods. Over 3000 S-bursts were observed on 9 July 2013 at frequencies of 17.4-83.1 MHz during a period of low solar activity. Leading models of S-burst generation were tested by analysing the spectral properties of S-bursts and estimating coronal magnetic field strengths. Results. S-bursts were found to have short durations of 0.5-0.9 s. Multiple instruments were used to measure the dependence of drift rate on frequency which is represented by a power law with an index of 1.57. For the first time, we show a linear relation between instantaneous bandwidth and frequency over a wide frequency band. The flux calibration and high sensitivity of UTR-2 enabled measurements of their fluxes, which yielded 11+3 SFU. The source particle velocities of S-bursts were found to be ~0.07 c. S-burst source heights were found to range from 1.3 R_Sun to 2 R_Sun. Furthermore, a contemporary theoretical model of S-burst generation was used to conduct remote sensing of the coronal magnetic field at these heights which yielded values of 0.9-5.8 G. Within error, these values are comparable to those predicted by various relations between magnetic field strength and height in the corona.","Brendan P. Clarke, Diana E. Morosan, Peter T.

27,"NGC 3147 has been considered the best case of a true type 2 AGN: an unobscured AGN, based on the unabsorbed compact X-ray continuum, which lacks a broad line region (BLR). However, the very low luminosity of NGC 3147 implies a compact BLR, which produces very broad lines, hard to detect against the dominant background host galaxy. Narrow (0.1""x0.1"") slit HST spectroscopy allowed us to exclude most of the host galaxy light, and revealed an H$\alpha$ line with an extremely broad base (FWZI$\sim27\,000$ km s$^{-1}$). The line profile shows a steep cutoff blue wing and an extended red wing, which match the signature of a mildly relativistic thin accretion disk line profile. It is indeed well fit with a nearly face on thin disk, at $i\sim23^\circ$, with an inner radius at $77\pm15$ r$_g$, which matches the prediction of $62^{+18}_{-14}$ r$_g$ from the $R_{\rm BLR} \sim L^{1/2}$ relation. This result questions the very existence of true type 2 AGN. Moreover, the detection of a thin disk, which extends below 100 r$_g$ in an $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim10^{-4}$ system, contradicts the current view of the accretion flow configuration at extremely low accretion rates.","Stefano Bianchi, Robert Antonucci, Alessandro Capetti, Marco Chiaberge, Ari Laor, Loredana Bassani, Francisco J.

28,"In this present analysis we investigate the dust properties associated with the different gas phases (including the ionized phase this time) of the LMC molecular clouds at 1$^{\prime}$ angular resolution (four times greater than a previous analysis) and with a larger spectral coverage range thanks to Herschel data. We also ensure the robustness of our results in the framework of various dust models. We performed a decomposition of the dust emission in the infrared (3.6 $\mic$ to 500 $\mic$) associated with the atomic, molecular, and ionized gas phases in the molecular clouds of the LMC. The resulting spectral energy distributions were fitted with four distinct dust models. We then analyzed the model parameters such as the intensity of the radiation field and the relative dust abundances, as well as the slope of the emission spectra at long wavelengths. This work allows dust models to be compared with infrared data in various environments for the first time, which reveals important differences between the models at short wavelengths in terms of data fitting (mainly in the PAH bands). In addition, this analysis points out distinct results according to the gas phases, such as dust composition directly affecting the dust temperature and the dust emissivity in the submm, and different dust emission in the near-infrared (NIR). We observe direct evidence of dust property evolution from the diffuse to the dense medium in a large sample of molecular clouds in the LMC. In addition, the differences in the dust component abundances between the gas phases could indicate different origins of grain formation. We also point out the presence of a NIR-continuum in all gas phases, with an enhancement in the ionized gas. We favor the hypothesis of an additional dust component as the carrier of this continuum.","D. Paradis, C. MÃ©ny, M. Juvela, A. Noriega-Crespo, I.

29,"Several recent studies have shown that very wide binary stars can potentially provide an interesting test for modified-gravity theories which attempt to emulate dark matter; these systems should be almost Newtonian according to standard dark-matter theories, while the predictions for MOND-like theories are distinctly different, if the various observational issues can be overcome. Here we explore an observational application of the test from the recent GAIA DR2 data release: we select a large sample of $\sim 24,000$ candidate wide binary stars with distance $< 200$ parsec and magnitudes $G < 16$ from GAIA DR2, and estimated component masses using a main-sequence mass-luminosity relation. We then compare the frequency distribution of pairwise relative projected velocity (relative to circular-orbit value) as a function of projected separation; these distributions show a clear peak at a value close to Newtonian expectations, along with a long `tail' which extends to much larger velocity ratios; the `tail' is considerably more numerous than in control samples constructed from DR2 with randomised positions, so its origin is unclear. Comparing the velocity histograms with simulated data, we conclude that MOND-like theories without an external field effect are strongly inconsistent with the observed data since they predict a peak-shift in clear disagreement with the data; testing MOND-like theories with an external field effect is not decisive at present, but has good prospects to become decisive in future with improved modelling or understanding of the high-velocity tail, and additional spectroscopic data.","Charalambos Pittordis, Will Sutherland","Latex, 14 pages, 11 figures.

30,"The Mathisson-Papapetrou equations are used for investigations of influence of the spin-gravity coupling on a highly relativistic spinning particle in Schwarzschild's field. It is established that interaction of the particle spin with the gravitomagnetic components of the field, estimated in the proper frame of the particle, causes the large acceleration of the spinning particle relative to geodesic free fall. As a result the accelerated charged spinning particle can generate intensive electromagnetic radiation when its velocity is highly relativistic.

31,"IceCube is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov telescope operating at the South Pole. Its goal is to detect astrophysical neutrinos and identify their sources. High-energy muon neutrinos are identified through the secondary muons produced via charge current interactions with the ice. The present best-performing directional reconstruction of the muon track is a maximum likelihood method which uses the arrival time distribution of Cherenkov photons registered by the experiment's photomultipliers. Known systematic shortcomings of this method are to assume continuous energy loss along the muon track, and to neglect photomultiplier-related effects such as prepulses and afterpulses. This work discusses an improvement of about 20% to the muon angular resolution of IceCube and its planned extension, IceCube-Gen2. In the reconstruction scheme presented here, the expected arrival time distribution is now parametrized by a predetermined stochastic muon energy loss pattern. The inclusion of pre- and afterpulses modelling in the PDF has also been studied, but no noticeable improvement was found, in particular in comparison to the modification of the energy loss profile.","Federica Bradascio, Thorsten GlÃ¼senkamp",Proceeding for the VLVnT-2018 Conference,1905.09612v1,No journal ref found,Thorsten GlÃ¼senkamp,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09612v1,2019-05-23 12:17:31+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.HE|physics.ins-det,Improving the muon track reconstruction of IceCube and IceCube-Gen2,2019-05-23 12:17:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09612v1
32,"The EDGES low-band experiment has measured an absorption feature in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), corresponding to the 21 cm hyperfine transition of hydrogen at redshift $z \simeq 17$, before the era of cosmic reionization. The amplitude of this absorption is connected to the ratio of singlet and triplet hyperfine states in the hydrogen gas, which can be parametrized by a spin temperature. The EDGES result suggests that the spin temperature is lower than the expected temperatures of both the CMB and the hydrogen gas. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain this signal, for example by lowering the kinetic temperature of the hydrogen gas via dark matter interactions. We introduce an alternative mechanism, by which a sub-GeV dark matter particle with spin-dependent coupling to nucleons or electrons can cause hyperfine transitions and lower the spin temperature directly, with negligible reduction of the kinetic temperature of the hydrogen gas. We consider a model with an asymmetric dark matter fermion and a light pseudo-vector mediator. Significant reduction of the spin temperature by this simple model is excluded, most strongly by coupling constant bounds coming from stellar cooling. Perhaps an alternative dark sector model, subject to different sets of constraints, can lower the spin temperature by the same mechanism.",Axel Widmark,"24 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in JCAP",1902.09552v2,No journal ref found,Axel Widmark,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09552v2,2019-02-25 19:00:02+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,21 cm cosmology and spin temperature reduction via spin-dependent dark   matter interactions,2019-05-23 12:08:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09552v2
33,"The properties of dense QCD matter are delineated through the construction of equations of state which should be consistent with QCD calculations in the low and high density limits, nuclear laboratory experiments, and the neutron star observations. These constraints, together with the causality condition of the sound velocity, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in which hadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter (modulo small 1st order phase transitions). For hadronic matter (at baryon density nB > ~2n0 with n0 ~ 0.16 fm^(-3) being the nuclear saturation density) we use equations of state by Togashi et al. based on microscopic variational many-body calculations, and for quark matter (nB > ~5n0) we construct equations of state using a schematic quark model (with strangeness) whose interactions are motivated by the hadron phenomenology. The region between hadronic and quark matters (~2n0 < nB < ~5n0), which is most difficult to calculate, is treated by highly constrained interpolation between nuclear and quark matter equations of state. The resultant unified equation of state at zero temperature and beta-equilibrium, which we call Quark-Hadron-Crossover (QHC18 and QHC19), is consistent with the measured properties of neutron stars and in addition gives us microscopic insights into the properties of dense QCD matter. In particular to ~10n0 the gluons can remain as non-perturbative as in vacuum and the strangeness can be as abundant as up- and down-quarks at the core of two-solar mass neutron stars. Within our modeling the maximum mass is found less than ~2.35 times solar mass and the baryon density at the core ranges in ~5-8n0.",Toru Kojo,"18 pages 11 figures, AIP Proceedings of the Xiamen-CUSTIPEN Workshop

34,"X-ray point sources in galaxies are dominated by X-ray binaries (XRBs) that are variables or transients and whether their variability would alter the X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) is still in debate. Here we report on NGC 7331 as an example to test this with 7 Chandra observations. Their detection limit is 7$\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3 -- 8.0 keV energy range by assuming a power-law spectral model with a photon index of 1.7. We detected 55 X-ray sources. Thirteen of them are variables for which 3 of them are transients and some of the sources possess a bimodal luminosity-hardness ratio feature, which is often observed among X-ray binaries. Nine more ultra-luminous X-ray sources are found comparing to previous studies and 8 are likely to be low-mass or high-mass XRBs. Twenty-one optical counterpart candidates are found based on the Hubble Space Telescope images, but we cannot rule out the possibility of positional coincidence. The spectral analysis of SN 2014C shows a trend of increasing soft photons and decreasing hydrogen column densities as its outer shell expands. We fit the 7 incompleteness-corrected XLFs to both a power-law (PL) and a power-law with an exponential cut-off (PLC) model using Bayesian method, which is the first time used in XLF fitting. The hierarchical PLC model can describe the XLF of NGC 7331 best with a slope of $\sim$ 0.5 and a luminosity cut-off around 8$\times$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This study proves that multi-epoch observations decrease the deviation due to the variable luminous sources in XLFs.","Ruolan Jin, Albert K. H.

35,"Different regularizations of the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum cosmology yield modified loop quantum cosmologies, namely mLQC-I and mLQC-II, which lead to qualitatively different Planck scale physics. We perform a comprehensive analysis of resolution of various singularities in these modified loop cosmologies using effective spacetime description and compare with earlier results in standard loop quantum cosmology. We show that the volume remains non-zero and finite in finite time evolution for all considered loop cosmological models. Interestingly, even though expansion scalar and energy density are bounded due to quantum geometry, curvature invariants can still potentially diverge due to pressure singularities at a finite volume. These divergences are shown to be harmless since geodesic evolution does not break down and no strong singularities are present in the effective spacetimes of loop cosmologies. Using a phenomenological matter model, various types of exotic strong and weak singularities, including big rip, sudden, big freeze and type-IV singularities, are studied. We show that as in standard loop quantum cosmology, big rip and big freeze singularities are resolved in mLQC-I and mLQC-II, but quantum geometric effects do not resolve sudden and type-IV singularities.","Sahil Saini, Parampreet Singh",Minor revision to match published version in CQG,1812.08937v2,No journal ref found,Parampreet Singh,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08937v2,2018-12-21 04:15:35+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,Generic absence of strong singularities and geodesic completeness in   modified loop quantum cosmologies,2019-05-23 11:35:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08937v2
36,"Galactic disc chemical evolution models generally ignore azimuthal surface density variation that can introduce chemical abundance azimuthal gradients. Recent observations, however, have revealed chemical abundance changes with azimuth in the gas and stellar components of both the Milky Way and external galaxies. To quantify the effects of spiral arm density fluctuations on the azimuthal variations of the oxygen and iron abundances in disc galaxies. We develop a new 2D galactic disc chemical evolution model, capable of following not just radial but also azimuthal inhomogeneities. The density fluctuations resulting from a Milky Way-like N-body disc formation simulation produce azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance gradients of the order of 0.1 dex. Moreover, in agreement with the most recent observations in external galaxies, the azimuthal variations are more evident in the outer galactic regions. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the largest fluctuations with azimuth result near the spiral structure corotation resonance, where the relative speed between spiral and gaseous disc is the slowest. In conclusion we provided a new 2D chemical evolution model capable of following azimuthal density variations. Density fluctuations extracted from a Milky Way-like dynamical model lead to a scatter in the azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance gradient in agreement with observations in external galaxies. We interpret the presence of azimuthal scatter at all radii by the presence of multiple spiral modes moving at different pattern speeds, as found in both observations and numerical simulations.","E.

37,"We investigate the possibility that the Sun could have been born in M67 by carrying out $N$-body simulations of M67-like clusters in a time-varying Galactic environment, and following the galactic orbits of stars that escape from them. We find that model clusters that occupy similar orbits to M67 today can be divided up into three groups. Hot clusters are born with a high initial $z$-velocity, depleted clusters are born on cold orbits but are destroyed by GMC encounters in the Galactic disc, and scattered clusters are born on cold orbits and survive with more than 1000 stars at an age of 4.6 Gyr. We find that all cluster models in all three cluster groups have stellar escapers that are kinematicaly similar to the Sun. Hot clusters having the lowest such fraction $f_{\odot} = 0.06$ %, whilst depleted clusters have the highest fraction, $f_{\odot} = 6.61$ %.

The recent observations of gravitational waves (GW170817) from the merger of two neutron stars, followed by an electromagnetic counterpart (GW170817a) have placed stringent constraints on the difference of the speed of gravity to the speed of light, severely restricting the phenomenological viability of such theories. We revisit the impact of these observations on the Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) paradigm of relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown class of this paradigm where the speed of gravity always equals the speed of light.

39,"Metropolis nested sampling evolves a Markov chain from a current livepoint and accepts new points along the chain according to a version of the Metropolis acceptance ratio modified to satisfy the likelihood constraint, characteristic of nested sampling algorithms. The geometric nested sampling algorithm we present here is a based on the Metropolis method, but treats parameters as though they represent points on certain geometric objects, namely circles, tori and spheres. For parameters which represent points on a circle or torus, the trial distribution is `wrapped' around the domain of the posterior distribution such that samples cannot be rejected automatically when evaluating the Metropolis ratio due to being outside the sampling domain. Furthermore, this enhances the mobility of the sampler. For parameters which represent coordinates on the surface of a sphere, the algorithm transforms the parameters into a Cartesian coordinate system before sampling which again makes sure no samples are automatically rejected, and provides a physically intutive way of the sampling the parameter space. \\ We apply the geometric nested sampler to two types of toy model which include circular, toroidal and spherical parameters. We find that the geometric nested sampler generally outperforms \textsc{MultiNest} in both cases. \\ %We also apply the algorithm to a gravitational wave detection model which includes circular and spherical parameters, and find that the geometric nested sampler and \textsc{MultiNest} appear to perform equally well as one another.

40,"The secluded dark matter resides within a hidden sector and self-annihilates into lighter mediators which subsequently decay to the Standard Model (SM) particles. Depending on the coupling strength of the mediator to the SM, the hidden sector can be kinetically decoupled from the SM bath when the temperature drops below the mediator's mass, and the dark matter annihilation cross section at freeze-out is thus possible to be boosted above the conventional value of weak interacting massive particles. We present a comprehensive study on thermodynamic evolution of the hidden sector from the first principle, using the simplest secluded vector dark matter model. Motivated by the observation of Galactic center gamma-ray excess, we take two mass sets $\sim{\cal O}(80\, \text{GeV})$ for the dark matter and mediator as examples to illustrate the thermodynamics. The coupled Boltzmann moment equations for number densities and temperature evolutions of the hidden sector are numerically solved. The formalism can be easily extended to a general secluded dark matter model. We show that a long-lived mediator can result in a boosted dark matter annihilation cross section to account for the relic abundance. We further show the parameter space which provides a good fit to the Galactic center excess data and is compatible with the current bounds and LUX-ZEPLIN projected sensitivity.

41,"Highly twisted magnetic flux ropes, with finite length, are subject to kink instabilities, and could lead to a number of eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere, including flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and coronal jets. The kink instability threshold, which is the maximum twist a kink-stable magnetic flux rope could contain, has been widely studied in analytical models and numerical simulations, but still needs to be examined by observations. In this article, we will study twists released by 30 off-limb rotational solar coronal jets, and compare the observational findings with theoretical kink instability thresholds. We have found that: 1) the number of events with more twist release becomes less; 2) each of the studied jets has released a twist number of at least 1.3 turns (a twist angle of 2.6$\pi$); and 3) the size of a jet is highly related to its twist pitch instead of twist number. Our results suggest that the kink instability threshold in the solar atmosphere should not be a constant. The found lower limit of twist number of 1.3 turns should be merely a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a finite solar magnetic flux rope to become kink unstable.","Jiajia Liu, Yuming Wang, Robertus ErdÃ©lyi","10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

42,"In this paper we consider a scenario where the currently observed hypervelocity stars in our Galaxy have been ejected from the Galactic center as a result of dynamical interactions with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) orbiting the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). By performing 3-body scattering experiments, we calculate the distribution of the ejected stars' velocities given various parameters of the IMBH-SMBH binary: IMBH mass, semimajor axis and eccentricity. We also calculate the rates of change of the BH binary orbital elements due to those stellar ejections. One of our new findings is that the ejection rate depends (although mildly) on the rotation of the stellar nucleus (its total angular momentum). We also compare the ejection velocity distribution with that produced by the Hills mechanism (stellar binary disruption) and find that the latter produces faster stars on average. Also, the IMBH mechanism produces an ejection velocity distribution which is flattened towards the BH binary plane while the Hills mechanism produces a spherically symmetric one. The results of this paper will allow us in the future to model the ejection of stars by an evolving BH binary and compare both models with \textit{Gaia} observations, for a wide variety of environments (galactic nuclei, globular clusters, the Large Magellanic Clouds, etc.).","Alexander Rasskazov, Giacomo Fragione, Nathan W.

43,"The luminosity of X-ray pulsars powered by accretion onto magnetized neutron stars covers a wide range over a few orders of magnitude. The brightest X-ray pulsars recently discovered as pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources reach accretion luminosity above $10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ which exceeds the Eddington value more than by a factor of ten. Most of the energy is released within small regions in the vicinity of magnetic poles of accreting neutron star - in accretion columns. Because of the extreme energy release within a small volume accretion columns of bright X-ray pulsars are ones of the hottest places in the Universe, where the internal temperature can exceed 100 keV. Under these conditions, the processes of creation and annihilation of electron-positron pairs can be influential but have been largely neglected in theoretical models of accretion columns. In this letter, we investigate properties of a gas of electron-positron pairs under physical conditions typical for accretion columns. We argue that the process of pairs creation can crucially influence both the dynamics of the accretion process and internal structure of accretion column limiting its internal temperature, dropping the local Eddington flux and increasing the gas pressure.","Alexander A.

44,"Characteristic signatures that X-ray reverberation from an extended corona can manifest in the observed PSD of AGN are investigated. The presence of two X-ray blobs illuminating an accretion disc can cause the interference between two reprocessing-echo components and produce distinct physical features in the PSD. The oscillatory structures (e.g., dips and humps) are seen but, contrarily to the lamp-post case, the strongest dip is not always the one at the lowest frequency. Instead, we find the frequency where the strongest dip is seen associates to the lower-source height while the lowest frequency where the first dip appears links with the upper-source height. This is because the reverberation timescales increase with the source height. Accurate modelling of the PSD then helps put constraints to the lower and upper limit of the corona extent. Furthermore, the reverberation signatures are less pronounced with increasing number of sources that do not produce reflection (e.g., additional X-rays from fast, relativistic outflows). The amplitude of the oscillations also depends on the amount of dilution contributed by the X-ray sources, thus encodes information about their relative brightness. Due to stronger dilutions, robust detection of these signatures with the current observations will become even more difficult if the corona is extended. Future observations made by Athena will enable us to fit these characteristics in statistically significant details, and to reveal the nature of the disc-corona system.",Poemwai Chainakun,"7 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.09559v1,No journal ref found,Poemwai Chainakun,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09559v1,2019-05-23 09:51:04+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Modelling the X-ray power spectra of AGN by using reprocessing echoes   from an extended corona,2019-05-23 09:51:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09559v1
45,"Spectropolarimetric inversions are routinely used in the field of Solar Physics for the extraction of physical information from observations. The application to two-dimensional fields of view often requires the use of supercomputers with parallelized inversion codes. Even in this case, the computing time spent on the process is still very large. Our aim is to develop a new inversion code based on the application of convolutional neural networks that can quickly provide a three-dimensional cube of thermodynamical and magnetic properties from the interpretation of two-dimensional maps of Stokes profiles. We train two different architectures of fully convolutional neural networks. To this end, we use the synthetic Stokes profiles obtained from two snapshots of three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic numerical simulations of different structures of the solar atmosphere. We provide an extensive analysis of the new inversion technique, showing that it infers the thermodynamical and magnetic properties with a precision comparable to that of standard inversion techniques. However, it provides several key improvements: our method is around one million times faster, it returns a three-dimensional view of the physical properties of the region of interest in geometrical height, it provides quantities that cannot be obtained otherwise (pressure and Wilson depression) and the inferred properties are decontaminated from the blurring effect of instrumental point spread functions for free.

46,"We investigate whether inflation requires finely tuned initial conditions in order to explain the degree of flatness and homogeneity observed in the Universe. We achieve this by using the Eisenhart lift, which can be used to write any scalar field theory in a purely geometric manner. Using this formalism, we construct a manifold whose points represent all possible initial conditions for an inflationary theory. After equipping this manifold with a natural metric, we show that the total volume of this manifold is finite for a wide class of inflationary potentials. Hence, we identify a natural measure that enables us to distinguish between generic and finely tuned sets of initial conditions without the need for a regulator, in contrast to previous work in the literature. Using this measure, we find that the initial conditions that allow for sufficient inflation are indeed finely tuned. The degree of fine-tuning also depends crucially on the value of the cosmological constant at the time of inflation. Examining the example potential $V=\lambda\varphi^4+\Lambda$, we find that we require percent-level fine tuning if we allow the cosmological constant during inflation to be much larger than it is today. However, if we fix the cosmological constant to its presently observed value, the degree of fine tuning required is of order $10^{-29}$.","Kieran Finn, Sotirios Karamitsos","27+1 pages, 2 figures.

47,"The physics of star formation and the deposition of mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium by massive stars (`feedback') are the main uncertainties in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. These processes determine the properties of galaxies, but are poorly understood on the $\lesssim$100 pc scale of individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations. The key question is why the timescale for depleting molecular gas through star formation in galaxies ($t_{\rm dep}\approx 2$ Gyr) exceeds the dynamical timescale of GMCs by two orders of magnitude. Either most of a GMC's mass is converted into stars over many dynamical times, or only a small fraction turns into stars before the GMC is dispersed on a dynamical timescale. Here we report our observation that molecular gas and star formation are spatially de-correlated on GMC scales in the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC300, contrary to their tight correlation on galactic scales. We demonstrate that this de-correlation implies rapid evolutionary cycling between GMCs, star formation, and feedback. We apply a novel statistical method to quantify the evolutionary timeline and find that star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback, driving GMC dispersal on short timescales (~1.5 Myr) due to radiation and stellar winds, prior to supernova explosions. This feedback limits GMC lifetimes to about one dynamical timescale (~10 Myr), with integrated star formation efficiencies of only 2-3%. Our findings reveal that galaxies consist of building blocks undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven lifecycles, that vary with the galactic environment and collectively define how galaxies form stars. Systematic applications of this multi-scale analysis to large galaxy samples will provide key input for a predictive, bottom-up theory of galaxy formation and evolution.","J. M.

All constraints in the theories remain first class and thus a graviton has only 2 local degrees of freedom. The cosmological solution of one of the examples in this class, the so-called square root gravity, exhibits a singularity freeness at high energy limit. At low energy limit, the theory smoothly connects to GR. A general feature of the theories in this class, with the self-consistent matter coupling discovered in our current work, is the non-trivial interaction among different components of matter sector.

If using a linear, modal reconstructor, the high laser power requirement ($\sim1000\,\mbox{W}$) renders PPPP uncompetitive with Laser Tomography AO. This work discusses easing the laser power requirements by using an artificial Neural Network (NN) as a non-linear reconstructor. We find that the non-linear NN reduces the required measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly to reduce PPPP laser power requirements to $\sim200\,\mbox{W}$ for useful residual wavefront error (WFE). At this power level, the WFE becomes 160\,nm root mean square (RMS) and 125\,nm RMS when $r_0=0.098$\,m and $0.171$\,m respectively for turbulence profiles which are representative of conditions at the ESO Paranal observatory. In addition, it is shown that as a non-linear reconstructor, a NN can perform useful wavefront sensing using a beam-profile from one height as the input instead of the two profiles required as a minimum by the linear reconstructor.","Huizhe Yang, Carlos Gonzalez Gutierrez, Nazim A.

50,"We study and compare different examples of stellar evolutionary synthesis input parameters used to produce photoionisation model grids using the MAPPINGS V modelling code. The aim of this study is to (a) explore the systematic effects of various stellar evolutionary synthesis model parameters on the interpretation of emission lines in optical strong-line diagnostic diagrams, (b) characterise the combination of parameters able to reproduce the spread of local galaxies located in the star-forming region in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and (c) investigate the emission from extremely metal-poor galaxies using photoionisation models. We explore and compare the stellar input ionising spectrum (stellar population synthesis code [Starburst99, SLUG, BPASS], stellar evolutionary tracks, stellar atmospheres, star-formation history, sampling of the initial mass function) as well as parameters intrinsic to the H II region (metallicity, ionisation parameter, pressure, H II region boundedness). We also perform a comparison of the photoionisation codes MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. On the variations in the ionising spectrum model parameters, we find that the differences in strong emission-line ratios between varying models for a given input model parameter are small, on average ~0.1 dex. An average difference of ~0.1 dex in emission-line ratio is also found between models produced with MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. Large differences between the emission-line ratios are found when comparing intrinsic H II region parameters. We find that low-metallicity galaxies are better explained by a density-bounded H II region and higher pressures better encompass the spread of galaxies at high redshift.","Joshua J.

51,"We present a convolutional neural network to classify distinct cosmological scenarios based on the statistically similar weak-lensing maps they generate. Modified gravity (MG) models that include massive neutrinos can mimic the standard concordance model ($\Lambda$CDM) in terms of Gaussian weak-lensing observables. An inability to distinguish viable models that are based on different physics potentially limits a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of cosmic acceleration. For a fixed redshift of sources, we demonstrate that a machine learning network trained on simulated convergence maps can discriminate between such models better than conventional higher-order statistics. Results improve further when multiple source redshifts are combined. To accelerate training, we implement a novel data compression strategy that incorporates our prior knowledge of the morphology of typical convergence map features. Our method fully distinguishes $\Lambda$CDM from its most similar MG model on noise-free data, and it correctly identifies among the MG models with at least 80% accuracy when using the full redshift information. Adding noise lowers the correct classification rate of all models, but the neural network still significantly outperforms the peak statistics used in a previous analysis.","Austin Peel, Florian Lalande, Jean-Luc Starck, Valeria Pettorino, Julian Merten, Carlo Giocoli, Massimo Meneghetti, Marco Baldi","12 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

52,"In this work, we propose a forward-modeling method to study the trajectory and speed of the interplanetary (IP) Type-III radio burst exciter. The model assumes that the source of an IP Type-III radio burst moves outward from the Sun following the Parker spiral field line. Using the arrival time of the radio waves at multiple spacecraft, we are able to determine the trajectory of the radio source in the Ecliptic plane, and its outward speed, as well as the injection time and longitude of the associated electron beam near the solar surface that triggers the Type-III radio burst. For the application of this method, we design a system to gather the arrival time of the radio wave from the radio dynamic spectra observed by Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)/WAVES and Wind/WAVES. Then the system forward models the trajectory and speed of the radio burst exciter iteratively according to an evaluation function. Finally, we present a survey of four Type-III radio bursts that are well discussed in the literature. The modeled trajectories of the radio source are consistent with the previous radio-triangulation results, the longitude of the associated active region, or the location of Langmuir waves excited by the electron beam.","Peijin Zhang, Chuanbing Wang, Lin Ye, Yuming Wang","20 pages, 9 figures",1905.09510v1,No journal ref found,Yuming Wang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09510v1,2019-05-23 07:31:36+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|physics.space-ph,Forward Modeling of the Type III Radio Burst Exciter,2019-05-23 07:31:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09510v1
53,"Low-energy inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms are important processes in stellar atmospheres, and a persistent source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling of stellar spectra. We have calculated and studied excitation and charge transfer of C i and of N i due to such collisions. We used a previously presented method that is based on an asymptotic two-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) model of ionic-covalent interactions for the adiabatic potential energies, combined with the multichannel Landau-Zener model for the collision dynamics. We find that charge transfer processes typically lead to much larger rate coefficients than excitation processes do, consistent with studies of other atomic species. Two-electron processes were considered and lead to non-zero rate coefficients that can potentially impact statistical equilibrium calculations. However, they were included in the model in an approximate way, via an estimate for the two-electron coupling that was presented earlier in the literature: the validity of these data should be checked in a future work.","A.

54,"Spectroscopic and structural properties of methoxymethyl radical (CH$_3$OCH$_2$, RDME) are determined using explicitly correlated ab initio methods. This radical of astrophysical and atmospheric relevance has not been fully characterized at low temperatures, which has delayed the astrophysical searches. We provide rovibrational parameters, excitations to the low energy electronic states, torsional and inversion barriers and low vibrational energy levels. In the electronic ground state (X$^2$A), which appears ""clean"" from non-adiabatic effects, the minimum energy structure is an asymmetric geometry which rotational constants and dipole moment have been determined to be A$_0$=46718.6745 MHz, B$_0$=10748.4182 MHz, and C$_0$=9272.5105 MHz, and 1.432 D ($\mu_A$=0.6952 D, $\mu_B$=1.215 D, $\mu_C$=0.3016 D), respectively. A variational procedure has been applied to determine torsion-inversion energy levels. Each level splits into 3 subcomponents (A$_1$/A$_2$ and E) corresponding to the three methyl torsion minima. Although the potential energy surface presents 12 minima, at low temperatures, the infrared band shapes correspond to a surface with only three minima because the top of the inversion V$^{\alpha}$ barrier at ${\alpha}=0^{\circ}$ (109 cm$^{-1}$) stands below the zero point vibrational energy and the CH$_2$ torsional barrier is relatively high ($\sim$2000 cm$^{-1}$). The methyl torsion barrier was computed to be $\sim$500 cm$^{-1}$ and produces a splitting of 0.01 cm$^{-1}$ of the ground vibrational state.","O. Yazidi, M. L. Senent, V. GÃ¡mez, M. Carvajal, M.

The cyclotron line energy of $E_{\rm cyc}=47.7\pm0.8$ keV was measured at the luminosity of almost an order of magnitude lower than what was achieved before.

56,"This paper reports on the atomic hydrogen gas (HI) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 1566 using the newly commissioned Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope. We measure an integrated HI flux density of $180.2$ Jy km s$^{-1}$ emanating from this galaxy, which translates to an HI mass of $1.94\times10^{10}$M$_\circ$ at an assumed distance of $21.3$ Mpc. Our observations show that NGC 1566 has an asymmetric and mildly warped HI disc. The HI-to-stellar mass fraction of NGC 1566 is $0.29$, which is high in comparison with galaxies that have the same stellar mass ($10^{10.8}$M$_\circ$). We also derive the rotation curve of this galaxy to a radius of $50$ kpc and fit different mass models to it. The NFW, Burkert and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo profiles fit the observed rotation curve reasonably well and recover dark matter fractions of $0.62$, $0.58$ and $0.66$, respectively. Down to the column density sensitivity of our observations ($N_{HI} = 3.7\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$), we detect no HI clouds connected to, or in the nearby vicinity of, the HI disc of NGC 1566 nor nearby interacting systems. We conclude that, based on a simple analytic model, ram pressure interactions with the IGM can affect the HI disc of NGC 1566 and is possibly the reason for the asymmetries seen in the HI morphology of NGC 1566.","A.

57,"We constrain the distribution of spatially offset Lyman-alpha emission (Ly$\alpha$) relative to rest-frame ultraviolet emission in $\sim300$ high redshift ($3<z<5.5$) Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) exhibiting Ly$\alpha$ emission from VANDELS, a VLT/VIMOS slit-spectroscopic survey of the CANDELS Ultra Deep Survey and Chandra Deep Field South fields (${\simeq0.2}~\mathrm{deg}^2$ total). Because slit spectroscopy compresses two-dimensional spatial information into one spatial dimension, we use Bayesian inference to recover the underlying Ly$\alpha$ spatial offset distribution. We model the distribution using a 2D circular Gaussian, defined by a single parameter $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$, the standard deviation expressed in polar coordinates. Over the entire redshift range of our sample ($3<z<5.5$), we find $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=1.70^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ kpc ($68\%$ conf.), corresponding to $\sim0.25$ arcsec at $\langle z\rangle=4.5$. We also find that $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ decreases significantly with redshift. Because Ly$\alpha$ spatial offsets can cause slit-losses, the decrease in $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ with redshift can partially explain the increase in the fraction of Ly$\alpha$ emitters observed in the literature over this same interval, although uncertainties are still too large to reach a strong conclusion. If $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ continues to decrease into the reionization epoch, then the decrease in Ly$\alpha$ transmission from galaxies observed during this epoch might require an even higher neutral hydrogen fraction than what is currently inferred. Conversely, if spatial offsets increase with the increasing opacity of the IGM, slit losses may explain some of the drop in Ly$\alpha$ transmission observed at $z>6$. Spatially resolved observations of Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum at $6<z<8$ are needed to settle the issue.","A. Hoag, T. Treu, L. Pentericci, R. Amorin, M. Bolzonella, M. BradaÄ, M. Castellano, F.

58,"The first detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 has started to provide important new constraints on the nuclear equation of state at high density. The tidal deformability bound of GW170817 combined with the observed two solar mass neutron star poses a serious challenge to theoretical formulations of realistic equations of state. We analyze a fully comprehensive set of relativistic nuclear mean-field theories by confronting them with the observational bounds and the measured neutron-skin thickness. We find that only a few models can withstand these bounds which predict a stiff overall equation of state but with a soft neutron-proton symmetry energy. Two possible indications are proposed: Circumstantial evidence of hadron-quark phase transition inside the star and new parametrizations that are consistent with ground state properties of finite nuclei and observational bounds. Based on extensive analysis of these sets, an upper limit on the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star of $R_{1.4}\lesssim 12.9$ km is deduced.","Rana Nandi, Prasanta Char, Subrata Pal",Matches with the published version,1809.07108v3,No journal ref found,Subrata Pal,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07108v3,2018-09-19 10:05:52+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|nucl-th,Constraining the relativistic mean-field model equations of state with   gravitational wave observations,2019-05-23 04:42:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07108v3
59,"The HH 211 protostellar system is currently the youngest Class 0 system found with a rotating disk. We have mapped it at ~ 50 au (0.16"") resolution, studying its magnetic field morphology with dust polarization in continuum at 232 and 358 GHz and its kinematics in C18O J=2-1 line. A flattened envelope extending out to ~ 400 au from the disk is detected in the continuum and C18O, slightly misaligned with the disk by 8 degree. It is spiraling inwards and expected to transform into a rotating disk at ~ 20 au, consistent with the disk radius estimated before. It appears to have a constant specific angular momentum and itself can result from an inside-out collapse of an extended envelope detected before in NH$_3$. In the flattened envelope, the polarization is mainly due to the magnetically aligned dust grains, inferring a highly pinched poloidal field morphology there. Thus, both the kinematics and field morphology support that the flattened envelope is a pseudodisk formed as the infalling gas is guided by the field lines to the equatorial plane. Interestingly, a point symmetric polarization distribution is also seen in the flattened envelope, implying that the pinched field lines also have a significant toroidal component generated by the rotation. No significant loss of angular momentum and thus no clear magnetic braking are detected in the flattened envelope around the disk probably because of the large misalignment between the axis of the rotation and the axis of the magnetic field in the cloud core.","Chin-Fei Lee, Woojin Kwon, Kai-Syun Jhan, Naomi Hirano, Hsiang-Chih Hwang, Shih-Ping Lai, Tao-Chung Ching, Ramprasad Rao, Paul T.

60,"A significant fraction of stars between 7-11 solar masses are thought to become supernovae, but the explosion mechanism is unclear. The answer depends critically on the rate of electron capture on $^{20}$Ne in the degenerate oxygen-neon stellar core. However, due to the unknown strength of the transition between the ground states of $^{20}$Ne and $^{20}$F, it has not previously been possible to fully constrain the rate. By measuring the transition, we have established that its strength is exceptionally large and enhances the capture rate by several orders of magnitude. This has a decisive impact on the evolution of the core, increasing the likelihood that the star is (partially) disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion rather than collapsing to form a neutron star. Importantly, our measurement resolves the last remaining nuclear physics uncertainty in the final evolution of degenerate oxygen-neon stellar cores, allowing future studies to address the critical role of convection, which at present is poorly understood.","O.

61,"We present all-sky maps of two major FUV cooling lines, C IV and O VI, of highly ionized gas to investigate the nature of the transition-temperature gas. From the extinction-corrected line intensities of C IV and O VI, we calculated the gas temperature and the emission measure of the transition-temperature gas assuming isothermal plasma in the collisional ionization equilibrium. The gas temperature was found to be more or less uniform throughout the Galaxy with a value of (1.89 $\pm$ 0.06) $\times$ $10^5$ K. The emission measure of the transition-temperature gas is described well by a disk-like model in which the scale height of the electron density is $z_0=6_{-2}^{+3}$ kpc. The total mass of the transition-temperature gas is estimated to be approximately $6.4_{-2.8}^{+5.2}\times10^9 M_{\bigodot}$. We also calculated the volume-filling fraction of the transition-temperature gas, which was estimated to be $f=0.26\pm0.09$, and varies from $f\sim0.37$ in the inner Galaxy to $f\sim0.18$ in the outer Galaxy. The spatial distribution of C IV and O VI cannot be explained by a simple supernova remnant model or a three-phase model. The combined effects of supernova remnants and turbulent mixing layers can explain the intensity ratio of C IV and O VI. Thermal conduction front models and high-velocity cloud models are also consistent with our observation.","Young-Soo Jo, Kwang-il Seon, Kyoung-Wook Min, Jerry Edelstein, Wonyong Han","20 pages, 16 figures, Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal

62,"High obliquity planets represent potentially extreme limits of terrestrial climate, as they exhibit large seasonality, a reversed annual-mean pole-to-equator gradient of stellar heating, and novel cryospheres. A suite of 3-D global climate model simulations with a dynamic ocean is performed with Earthlike atmospheres for low and high obliquity planets with various stellar fluxes, CO2 concentrations, and initial conditions to explore the propensity for high obliquity climates approaching the outer edge of the Habitable Zone to undergo global glaciation. We also simulate planets with thick CO2 or H2 atmospheres, such as those expected to develop near or beyond the outer edge of the Habitable Zone.   We show that high obliquity planets are hotter than their low obliquity counterparts due to ice-albedo feedbacks for cold climates, and water vapor in warm climates. We suggest that the water vapor greenhouse trapping is greater on high obliquity bodies due to the different dynamical regimes that occur between the two states.   While equatorial ice-belts are stable at high obliquity in some climate regimes, it is harder to achieve global glaciation than for a low obliquity planet. Temperate polar conditions can be present at high obliquity at forcings for which low obliquity planets would be in a hard snowball state. We suggest the conditions on high obliquity planets are likely to be more favorable for a robust biosphere to develop approaching the outer edge of the HZ. However, the influence of obliquity diminishes for dense atmospheres, in agreement with calculations from 1-D Energy Balance Models.","Christopher M. Colose, Anthony D. Del Genio, Michael J.

65,"We use the UniverseMachine to analyze the source of scatter between the central galaxy mass, the total stellar mass in the halo, and the dark matter halo mass. We also propose a new halo mass estimator, the cen+N mass: the sum of the stellar mass of the central and the N most massive satellites. We show that, when real space positions are perfectly known, the cen+N mass has scatter competitive with that of richness-based estimators. However, in redshift space, the cen+N mass suffers less from projection effects in the UniverseMachine model. The cen+N mass is therefore a viable low scatter halo mass estimator, and should be considered an important tool to constrain cosmology with upcoming spectroscopic data from DESI. We analyze the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass and show that the total stellar mass in a halo is uncorrelated with secondary halo properties, but that the central stellar mass is a function of both halo mass and halo age. This is because central galaxies in older halos have had more time to grow via accretion. If the UniverseMachine model is correct, accurate galaxy-halo modeling of mass selected samples therefore needs to consider halo age in addition to mass.","Christopher Bradshaw, Alexie Leauthaud, Andrew Hearin, Song Huang, Peter Behroozi","13 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1905.09353v1,No journal ref found,Peter Behroozi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09353v1,2019-05-22 20:18:19+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,"Physical Correlations of the Scatter between Galaxy Mass, Stellar   Content, and Halo Mass",2019-05-22 20:18:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09353v1

Specifically, this model leads to a tiny perturbation in the dynamics of the expansion of the universe through the generalized Friedmann equations so-called the extended $\Lambda$CDM model. From the observational test standpoint, we make a Bayesian analysis of the models of bulk viscosity for dark energy which follows the Eckart theory of bulk viscosity. These models are investigated through the context of both models $\Lambda$CDM and extended $\Lambda$CDM.

67,"We present the lens mass model of the quadruply-imaged gravitationally lensed quasar WFI2033-4723, and perform a blind cosmographical analysis based on this system. Our analysis combines (1) time-delay measurements from 14 years of data obtained by the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses (COSMOGRAIL) collaboration, (2) high-resolution $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ imaging, (3) a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy based on ESO-MUSE data, and (4) multi-band, wide-field imaging and spectroscopy characterizing the lens environment. We account for all known sources of systematics, including the influence of nearby perturbers and complex line-of-sight structure, as well as the parametrization of the light and mass profiles of the lensing galaxy. After unblinding, we determine the effective time-delay distance to be $4784_{-248}^{+399}~\mathrm{Mpc}$, an average precision of $6.6\%$. This translates to a Hubble constant $H_{0} = 71.6_{-4.9}^{+3.8}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a uniform prior on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ in the range [0.05, 0.5].

68,"We examine the different element abundances exhibited by the closed loop solar corona and the slow speed solar wind. Both are subject to the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect, the enhancement in coronal abundance of elements with FIP below 10 eV (e.g. Mg, Si, Fe) with respect to high FIP elements (e.g. O, Ne, Ar), but with subtle differences. Intermediate elements, S, P, and C, with FIP just above 10 eV, behave as high FIP elements in closed loops, but are fractionated more like low FIP elements in the solar wind. On the basis of FIP fractionation by the ponderomotive force in the chromosphere, we discuss fractionation scenarios where this difference might originate. Fractionation low in the chromosphere where hydrogen is neutral enhances the S, P and C abundances. This arises with nonresonant waves, which are ubiquitous in open field regions, and is also stronger with torsional Alfven waves, as opposed to shear (i.e. planar) waves. We discuss the bearing these findings have on models of interchange reconnection as the source of the slow speed solar wind. The outflowing solar wind must ultimately be a mixture of the plasma in the originally open and closed fields, and the proportions and degree of mixing should depend on details of the reconnection process. We also describe novel diagnostics in ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy now available with these new insights, with the prospect of investigating slow speed solar wind origins and the contribution of interchange reconnection by remote sensing.","J.

In comparison to past work, where the application of the formulation was aimed for the timelike-null initial value problem, we consider here a boundary surface that is a null hypersurface. All of the initial data are either metric functions or first derivatives of the metric. Given such a set of initial data, Einstein equations can be integrated in a hierarchical manner, where first a set of equations is solved hierarchically on the null hypersurface serving as a boundary. Second, with the obtained boundary values, a set of differential equations, similar to the equations of the Bondi-Sachs formalism, comprising of hypersurface and evolution equations is solved hierarchically to find the entire space-time metric.

71,"Modern cosmological analyses constrain physical parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or similar sampling techniques. Oftentimes, these techniques are computationally expensive to run and require up to thousands of CPU hours to complete. Here we present a method for reconstructing the log-probability distributions of completed experiments from an existing MCMC chain (or any set of posterior samples). The reconstruction is performed using Gaussian process regression for interpolating the log-probability. This allows for easy resampling, importance sampling, marginalization, testing different samplers, investigating chain convergence, and other operations. As an example use-case, we reconstruct the posterior distribution of the most recent Planck 2018 analysis. We then resample the posterior, and generate a new MCMC chain with forty times as many points in only thirty minutes.

72,"We compute the dynamical friction on a small perturber moving through an inviscid fluid, i.e., a superfluid. Crucially, we account for the tachyonic gravitational mass for sound waves, reminiscent of the Jeans instability of the fluid, which results in non-zero dynamical friction even for subsonic velocities. Moreover, we illustrate that the standard leading order effective theory in the derivative expansion is in general inadequate for analysing supersonic processes. We show this in two ways: (i) with a fluid treatment, where we solve the linearized hydrodynamical equations coupled to Newtonian gravity; and (ii) with a quasiparticle description, where we study the energy dissipation of a moving perturber due to phonon radiation. Ordinarily a subsonic perturber moving through a superfluid is kinematically prohibited from losing energy, however the Jeans instability modifies the dispersion relation of the fluid which can result in a small but non-vanishing dynamical friction force. We also analyse the soft phonon bremsstrahlung by a subsonic perturber scattered off an external field.","Lasha Berezhiani, Benjamin Elder, Justin Khoury",26 pages,1905.09297v1,No journal ref found,Justin Khoury,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09297v1,2019-05-22 18:00:06+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.GA|gr-qc|hep-th,Dynamical Friction in Superfluids,2019-05-22 18:00:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09297v1
73,"The Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign initially designed to study the effects of environment on galaxy evolution in high-redshift ($z\sim1$) large-scale structures. We use its rich data in combination with a powerful new technique, Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC) mapping, to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at $0.55 < z < 1.37$ within 15 ORELSE fields, a combined spectroscopic footprint of $\sim$1.4 square degrees. Through extensive tests with both observational data and our own mock galaxy catalogs, we optimize the method's many free parameters to maximize its efficacy for general overdensity searches. Our overdensity search yielded 402 new overdensity candidates with precisely measured redshifts and an unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses ($\mathcal{M}_{tot} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$). Using the mock catalogs, we estimated the purity and completeness of our overdensity catalog as a function of redshift, total mass, and spectroscopic redshift fraction, finding impressive levels of both 0.92/0.83 and 0.60/0.49 for purity/completeness at $z=0.8$ and $z=1.2$, respectively, for all overdensity masses at spectroscopic fractions of $\sim$20%. With VMC mapping, we are able to measure precise systemic redshifts, provide an estimate of the total gravitating mass, and maintain high levels of purity and completeness at $z\sim1$ even with only moderate levels of spectroscopy. Other methods (e.g., red-sequence overdensities and hot medium reliant detections) begin to fail at similar redshifts, which attests to VMC mapping's potential to be a powerful tool for current and future wide-field galaxy evolution surveys at $z\sim1$ and beyond.","D.

74,"Measurements of stellar properties of galaxies when the universe was less than one billion years old yield some of the only observational constraints of the onset of star formation. We present here the inclusion of \textit{Spitzer}/IRAC imaging in the spectral energy distribution fitting of the seven highest-redshift galaxy candidates selected from the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS). We find that for 6/8 \textit{HST}-selected $z\gtrsim8$ sources, the $z\gtrsim8$ solutions are still strongly preferred over $z\sim$1-2 solutions after the inclusion of \textit{Spitzer} fluxes, and two prefer a $z\sim 7$ solution, which we defer to a later analysis. We find a wide range of intrinsic stellar masses ($5\times10^6 M_{\odot}$ -- $4\times10^9$ $M_{\odot}$), star formation rates (0.2-14 $M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$), and ages (30-600 Myr) among our sample. Of particular interest is Abell1763-1434, which shows evidence of an evolved stellar population at $z\sim8$, implying its first generation of star formation occurred just $< 100$ Myr after the Big Bang. SPT0615-JD, a spatially resolved $z\sim10$ candidate, remains at its high redshift, supported by deep \textit{Spitzer}/IRAC data, and also shows some evidence for an evolved stellar population.

75,"Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars dominate the radiative and mechanical energy budget of galaxies and probe a critical phase in the evolution of massive stars prior to core-collapse. It is not known whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR, cWR) form predominantly through wind-stripping (w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). With spectroscopy of WR binaries so-far largely avoided due to its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries / binary candidates of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, metallicity Z~0.5 Zsun), identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite spectra, or high X-ray luminosities. Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive stars at sub-solar metallicity, and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming them. Spectroscopy is performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement is performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status is interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically-homogeneous evolution.   No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently-single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently-single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.","T. Shenar, D. P. Sablowski, R.

76,"ALMA observations of the Serpens South star-forming region suggest that stellar protoclusters may be completely mass segregated at birth. Independent observations also suggest that embedded clusters form segregated by mass. As the primordial mass segregation seems to be lost over time, we aim to study on which timescale an initially perfectly mass-segregated star cluster becomes indistinguishable from an initially not mass-segregated cluster. As an example, the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is also discussed. We used $N$-body simulations of star clusters with various masses and two different degrees of primordial mass segregation. We analysed their energy redistribution through two-body relaxation to quantify the time when the models agree in terms of mass segregation, which sets in only dynamically in the models that are primordially not mass segregated. A comprehensive cross-matched catalogue combining optical, infrared, and X-ray surveys of ONC members was also compiled and made available. The models evolve to a similar radial distribution of high-mass stars after the core collapse (about half a median two-body relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{rh}$) and become observationally indistinguishable from the point of view of mass segregation at time $\tau_\mathrm{v} \approx 3.3\,t_\mathrm{rh}$. In the case of the ONC, using the distribution of high-mass stars, we may not rule out either evolutionary scenario (regardless of whether they are initially mass segregated). When we account for extinction and elongation of the ONC, as reported elsewhere, an initially perfectly mass-segregated state seems to be more consistent with the observed cluster.","VÃ¡clav PavlÃ­k, Pavel Kroupa, Ladislav Å ubr","A&A (in press), 17 pages, 15 figures, data available at CDS",1905.09289v1,No journal ref found,Ladislav Å ubr,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09289v1,2019-05-22 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Do star clusters form in a completely mass-segregated way?,2019-05-22 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09289v1
77,"The background photon temperature $\bar T$ is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters. Despite its significance, $\bar T$ has never been allowed to vary in the data analysis, owing to the precise measurement of the comic microwave background (CMB) temperature by COBE FIRAS. However, even in future CMB experiments, $\bar T$ will remain unknown due to the unknown monopole contribution $\Theta_0$ at our position to the observed (angle-averaged) temperature $\langle T\rangle^{\rm obs}$. By fixing $\bar T\equiv\langle T\rangle^{\rm obs}$, the standard analysis underestimates the error bars on cosmological parameters, and the best-fit parameters obtained in the analysis are biased in proportion to the unknown amplitude of $\Theta_0$. Using the Fisher formalism, we find that these systematic errors are smaller than the error bars from the $Planck$ satellite. However, with $\bar T\equiv\langle T\rangle^{\rm obs}$, these systematic errors will always be present and irreducible, and future cosmological surveys might misinterpret the measurements.","Jaiyul Yoo, Ermis Mitsou, Yves Dirian, Ruth Durrer","4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to PRL",1905.09288v1,No journal ref found,Ruth Durrer,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09288v1,2019-05-22 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,$\bar T$: A New Cosmological Parameter?,2019-05-22 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09288v1
78,"Most known trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) gravitationally scattering off the giant planets have orbital inclinations consistent with an origin from the classical Kuiper belt, but a small fraction of these ""scattering TNOs"" have inclinations that are far too large (i > 45 deg) for this origin. These scattering outliers have previously been proposed to be interlopers from the Oort cloud or evidence of an undiscovered planet. Here we test these hypotheses using N-body simulations and the 69 centaurs and scattering TNOs detected in the Outer Solar Systems Origins Survey and its predecessors. We confirm that observed scattering objects cannot solely originate from the classical Kuiper belt, and we show that both the Oort cloud and a distant planet generate observable highly inclined scatterers. Although the number of highly inclined scatterers from the Oort Cloud is ~3 times less than observed, Oort cloud enrichment from the Sun's galactic migration or birth cluster could resolve this. Meanwhile, a distant, low-eccentricity 5 Earth-mass planet replicates the observed fraction of highly inclined scatterers, but the overall inclination distribution is more excited than observed. Furthermore, the distant planet generates a longitudinal asymmetry among detached TNOs that is less extreme than often presumed, and its direction reverses across the perihelion range spanned by known TNOs. More complete models that explore the dynamical origins of the planet are necessary to further study these features. With observational biases well-characterized, our work shows that the orbital distribution of detected scattering bodies is a powerful constraint on the unobserved distant solar system.","Nathan A.

79,"We present spatially resolved kinematic measurements of AGN-driven outflows in dwarf galaxies in the stellar mass range $5.89\times10^8 - 9.33\times10^9 M_{\odot}$, selected from SDSS DR7,8 and followed up with Keck/LRIS spectroscopy. From a parent sample of 50 dwarf galaxies with and without AGN, we find spatially extended (up to $\sim 1.5\,\rm{kpc}$), high velocity ionized gas outflows ($W_{80}$ up to $\sim2000\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$) in 13 dwarf galaxies. Nine of the galaxies with outflows have optical line ratios indicative of AGN, and six of these have outflow components with optical line ratios also consistent with AGN ionization. Outflow velocities in all 13 galaxies exceed the escape velocities of their halos. Although black holes have been known to populate the centers of (at least a few) dwarf galaxies, and indirect evidence of AGN quenching of star formation in dwarfs has begun to surface, our measurements constitute the first direct detection and measurement of AGN impact on the large scale kinematics and gas content in dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find evidence suggestive of ongoing star formation suppression, possibly regulated by the AGN. Galaxy formation models must therefore be able to account not only for the formation and growth of black holes at the centers of dwarf galaxies, but should also be revised to include AGN as important -- and perhaps dominant -- sources of feedback in low mass galaxies.","Christina Manzano-King, Gabriela Canalizo, Laura Sales","16 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, submitted May 21, 2019",1905.09287v1,No journal ref found,Laura Sales,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09287v1,2019-05-22 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,AGN-Driven Outflows in Dwarf Galaxies,2019-05-22 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09287v1
80,"Dark matter direct detection experiments have poor sensitivity to a galactic population of dark matter with mass below the GeV scale. However, such dark matter can be produced copiously in supernovae. Since this thermally-produced population is much hotter than the galactic dark matter, it can be observed with direct detection experiments. In this paper, we focus on a dark sector with fermion dark matter and a heavy dark photon as a specific example. We first extend existing supernova cooling constraints on this model to the regime of strong coupling where the dark matter becomes diffusively trapped in the supernova. Then, using the fact that even outside these cooling constraints the diffuse galactic flux of these dark sector particles can still be large, we show that this flux is detectable in direct detection experiments such as current and next-generation liquid xenon detectors. As a result, due to supernova production, light dark matter has the potential to be discovered over many orders of magnitude of mass and coupling.","William DeRocco, Peter W.

81,"Sharpless 2-27 (Sh2-27) is a nearby ${\rm H\,{\small II}}$ region excited by $\zeta$Oph. We present observations of polarized radio emission from 300 to 480$\,$MHz towards Sh2-27, made with the Parkes 64$\,$m Radio Telescope as part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey. These observations have an angular resolution of $1.35^{\circ}$, and the data are uniquely sensitive to magneto-ionic structure on large angular scales. We demonstrate that background polarized emission towards Sh2-27 is totally depolarized in our observations, allowing us to investigate the foreground. We analyse the results of Faraday tomography, mapping the magnetised interstellar medium along the 165$\,$pc path to Sh2-27. The Faraday dispersion function in this direction has peaks at three Faraday depths. We consider both Faraday thick and thin models for this observation, finding that the thin model is preferred. We further model this as Faraday rotation of diffuse synchrotron emission in the Local Bubble and in two foreground neutral clouds. The Local Bubble extends for 80$\,$pc in this direction, and we find a Faraday depth of $-0.8 \pm 0.4\,$rad$\,$m$^{-2}$. This indicates a field directed away from the Sun with a strength of $-2.5\pm1.2\,\mu$G. The near and far neutral clouds are each about 30$\,$pc thick, and we find Faraday depths of $-6.6\pm0.6\,$rad$\,$m$^{-2}$ and $+13.7\pm0.8\,$rad$\,$m$^{-2}$, respectively. We estimate that the line-of-sight magnetic strengths in the near and far cloud are $B_{\parallel, \text{near}} \approx -15\,\mu\text{G}$ and $B_{\parallel, \text{far}} \approx +30\,\mu\text{G}$.

82,"The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (SN) is a highly anticipated observational target for neutrino telescopes. However, even prior to collapse, massive dying stars shine copiously in 'pre-supernova' (pre-SN) neutrinos, which can potentially act as efficient SN warning alarms and provide novel information about the very last stages of stellar evolution. We explore the sensitivity to pre-SN neutrinos of large scale direct dark matter detection experiments, which, unlike dedicated neutrino telescopes, take full advantage of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. We find that argon-based detectors with target masses of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ tonnes (i.e. comparable in size to the proposed ARGO experiment) can detect $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ pre SN neutrinos coming from a source at a characteristic distance of $\sim$200 pc, such as Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Orionis). For such a source, large scale dark matter experiments could provide a SN warning siren $\sim$10 hours prior to the explosion. We also comment on the complementarity of large scale direct dark matter detection experiments and neutrino telescopes in the understanding of core-collapse SN.","Nirmal Raj, Volodymyr Takhistov, Samuel J.

83,"$SU(2)$ gauge fields and axions can have a stable, isotropic and homogeneous configuration during inflation. However, couplings to other matter species lead to particle production, which in turn induces backreaction on and destabilization of the non-abelian and axion background. In this paper, we first study the particle production by a $SU(2)$ gauge field coupled to a massive Dirac doublet. To carry out this calculation we have made two technical improvements compared to what has been done in the literature. First, we apply the anti-symmetrization of the operators to treat particles and anti-particles on equal footing, second, to deal with the UV divergences, we apply instantaneous subtraction. We find that, the backreaction of produced fermions on the $SU(2)$ background is negligible for model parameters of observational interest. Next, we consider production of fermions due to coupling to the axion. The tree-level backreaction on the gauge fields, as well as on the axion, is vanishingly small. We also provide an estimate for the loop effects.","L. Mirzagholi, A. Maleknejad, K. D. Lozanov","22+15 pages, 5 figures",1905.09258v1,No journal ref found,K. D.

84,"We report the results from \textit{AstroSat} observations of the transient Galactic black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571 during its hard-intermediate state of the 2017 outburst. We systematically study the individual and joint spectra from two simultaneously observing \textit{AstroSat} X-ray instruments, and probe and measure a number of parameter values of accretion disc, corona and reflection from the disc in the system using models with generally increasing complexities. Using our broadband ($1.3-70$ keV) X-ray spectrum, we clearly show that a soft X-ray instrument, which works below $\sim 10-12$ keV, alone cannot correctly characterize the Comptonizing component from the corona, thus highlighting the importance of broadband spectral analysis. By fitting the reflection spectrum with the latest version of the \textsc{relxill} family of relativistic reflection models, we constrain the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter to be $0.67^{+0.16}_{-0.04}$. We also jointly use the reflection spectral component (\textsc{relxill}) and a general relativistic thin disc component (\texttt{Kerrbb}), and estimate the black hole's mass and distance to be $10.39_{-0.62}^{+0.61} M_{\odot}$ and $5.4_{-1.1}^{+1.8}$ kpc respectively.","Navin Sridhar, Sudip Bhattacharyya, Sunil Chandra, H.

85,"Inferring model parameters from experimental data is a grand challenge in many sciences, including cosmology. This often relies critically on high fidelity numerical simulations, which are prohibitively computationally expensive. The application of deep learning techniques to generative modeling is renewing interest in using high dimensional density estimators as computationally inexpensive emulators of fully-fledged simulations. These generative models have the potential to make a dramatic shift in the field of scientific simulations, but for that shift to happen we need to study the performance of such generators in the precision regime needed for science applications. To this end, in this work we apply Generative Adversarial Networks to the problem of generating weak lensing convergence maps. We show that our generator network produces maps that are described by, with high statistical confidence, the same summary statistics as the fully simulated maps.","Mustafa Mustafa, Deborah Bard, Wahid Bhimji, Zarija LukiÄ, Rami Al-Rfou, Jan M.

86,"1-propanol (CH3CH2CH2OH) is a three carbon-bearing representative of primary linear alcohols that may have its origin in the cold dark cores in interstellar space. To test this, we investigated in the laboratory whether 1-propanol ice can be formed along pathways possibly relevant to the prestellar core phase. We aim to show in a two-step approach that 1-propanol can be formed through reaction steps that are expected to take place during the heavy CO freeze-out stage by adding C2H2 into the CO + H hydrogenation network via the formation of propanal (CH3CH2CHO) as an intermediate and its subsequent hydrogenation. Temperature programmed desorption-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to identify the newly formed propanal and 1-propanol. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) is used as a complementary diagnostic tool. The mechanisms that can contribute to the formation of solid-state propanal and 1-propanol, as well as other organic compounds, during the heavy CO freeze-out stage are constrained by both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. Here it is shown that recombination of HCO radicals, formed upon CO hydrogenation, with radicals formed upon C2H2 processing - H2CCH and H3CCH2 - offers possible reaction pathways to solid-state propanal and 1-propanol formation. This extends the already important role of the CO hydrogenation chain in the formation of larger COMs (complex organic molecules). The results are used to compare with ALMA observations. The resulting 1-propanol:propanal ratio concludes an upper limit of < 0:35-0:55, which is complemented by computationally-derived activation barriers in addition to the experimental results.","D.

89,"Orbiting the Sun at an average distance of 0.59 au and with the shortest aphelion of any known minor body, at 0.77 au, the Atira-class asteroid 2019 AQ3 may be an orbital outlier or perhaps an early indication of the presence of a new population of objects: those following orbits entirely encompassed within that of Venus, the so-called Vatiras. Here, we explore the orbital evolution of 2019 AQ3 within the context of the known Atiras to show that, like many of them, it displays a present-day conspicuous coupled oscillation of the values of eccentricity and inclination, but no libration of the value of the argument of perihelion with respect to the invariable plane of the Solar system. The observed dynamics is consistent with being the result of the combined action of two dominant perturbers, the Earth-Moon system and Jupiter, and a secondary one, Venus. Such a multi-perturber-induced secular dynamics translates into a chaotic evolution that can eventually lead to a resonant behaviour of the Lidov-Kozai type. Asteroid 2019 AQ3 may have experienced brief stints as a Vatira in the relatively recent past and it may become a true Vatira in the future, outlining possible dynamical pathways that may transform Atiras into Vatiras and vice versa. Our results strongly suggest that 2019 AQ3 is only the tip of the iceberg: a likely numerous population of similar bodies may remain hidden in plain sight, permanently confined inside the Sun's glare.","C. de la Fuente Marcos, R. de la Fuente Marcos","11 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables.

90,"Aims : In this paper we aim at characterizing the properties of stars, dust and gas and their spatial distribution in the central region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068. Method : Our study is based on NIR (YJH, 0.95-1.650 um, R=350) long slit spectroscopy observations of NGC 1068's central region with 0.4"" spatial resolution. On the one hand we decomposed the observed continuum emission into three components: hot dust, stars and scattered light from the central engine to measure their contributions at various distances from the nucleus. On the other hand, we measured fluxes and doppler shifts for the emission lines present in our spectrum to probe the physical conditions of the Narrow Line Region. Results : Dust and stars are the main contributors to the continuum, but scattered light from the central engine is also detected in the very central region. Together, those three components are well reproducing the observed continuum. The dust emission is well modeled by a 800K blackbody, is spatially unresolved and only located in the very central region. The stellar content is ubiquitous and harbours a 250 pc cusp centered around the nucleus, overimposed to a young stellar background. The spectrum of the cusp is consistent with a 120 Myr single stellar population. Finally, the emission lines exhibit a significant doppler shift, consistent with a radial outflow from the nucleus in a biconical structure. The $\left[Fe\ II\right]$ behaviour strongly differs from other lines, suggesting that it arises from a different structure.","Pierre Vermot, Yann ClÃ©net, Damien Gratadour",12 pages - Submitted for publication in April 2019,1905.09208v1,No journal ref found,Damien Gratadour,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09208v1,2019-05-22 15:57:48+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,New insights on the central stellar population and gas outflow in NGC   1068 from YJH spectroscopy with SPHERE/VLT,2019-05-22 15:57:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09208v1
91,"The large majority of protoplanetary disks have very compact ($\lesssim15\,$AU) continuum emission at mm wavelengths. However, high angular resolution observations that resolve these small disks are still lacking, due to their intrinsically fainter emission compared with large bright disks. In this letter, we present $1.3\,$mm ALMA data of the faint ($\sim10\,$mJy) disk orbiting the TTauri star CX Tau at a resolution of $\sim40\,$mas, $\sim5\,$AU in diameter. The mm-dust disk is compact, with a 68$\%$ enclosing flux radius of 14$\,$AU, and the intensity profile exhibits a sharp drop between 10-20$\,$AU, and a shallow tail between 20-40$\,$AU. No clear signatures of substructure in the dust continuum are observed, down to the same sensitivity level of the DSHARP large program. However, the angular resolution does not allow to detect substructures at a scale of the disk aspect ratio in the inner regions. The radial intensity profile resembles well the inner regions of more extended disks imaged at the same resolution in DSHARP, but with no rings present in the outer disk. No inner cavity is detected, even though the disk has been classified as a transition disk from the spectral energy distribution in the near infrared. The emission of $^{12}$CO is much more extended, with a 68$\%$ enclosing flux radius of 75$\,$AU. The large difference of the mm dust and gas extents ($>5$) strongly points to the occurrence of radial drift, and matches well the predictions of theoretical models.","S. Facchini, E.

The Trumpler 14/Carina I region is in the west part of the Carina Nebula Complex, which is one of the most extreme star-forming regions in the Milky Way. We observed Trumpler 14/Carina I in the 158 $\mu$m transition of [C\,{\sc ii}] with a spatial resolution of 48$''$ and a velocity resolution of 0.17 km s$^{-1}$. The observations cover a 0.25$^\circ$ by 0.28$^\circ$ area with central position {\it l} = 297.34$^\circ$, {\it b} = -0.60$^\circ$. The kinematics show that bright [C\,{\sc ii}] structures are spatially and spectrally correlated with the surfaces of CO clouds, tracing the photodissociation region and ionization front of each molecular cloud. Along 7 lines of sight that traverse Tr 14 into the dark ridge to the southwest, we find that the [C\,{\sc ii}] luminosity from the HII region is 3.7 times that from the PDR.

Comparing multiple gas tracers including HI 21cm, [C\,{\sc ii}], CO, and radio recombination lines, we find that the HII regions of the Carina Nebula Complex are well-described as HII regions with one-side freely expanding towards us, consistent with the champagne model of ionized gas evolution.

94,"The M49 group, resident outside the virial radius of the Virgo cluster, is falling onto the cluster from the south. We report results from deep {\sl XMM-Newton} mosaic observations of M49. Its hot gas temperature is 0.8\,keV at the group center and rises to 1.5\,keV beyond the brightest group galaxy (BGG). The group gas extends to radii of $\sim300$\,kpc to the north and south. The observations reveal a cold front $\sim20$\,kpc north of the BGG center and an X-ray bright stripped tail 70\,kpc long and 10\,kpc wide to the southwest of the BGG. We argue that the atmosphere of the infalling group was slowed by its encounter with the Virgo cluster gas, causing the BGG to move forward subsonically relative to the group gas. We measure declining temperature and metallicity gradients along the stripped tail. The tail gas can be traced back to the cooler and enriched gas uplifted from the BGG center by buoyant bubbles, implying that AGN outbursts may have intensified the stripping process. We extrapolate to a virial radius of 740\,kpc and derive a virial mass of $4.6\times10^{13}\,M_\odot$ for the M49 group. Its group atmosphere appears truncated and deficient when compared with isolated galaxy groups of similar temperatures.

95,"Weakly interacting cold dark matter (CDM) particles, which are otherwise extremely successful in explaining various cosmological observations, exhibit a number of problems on small scales. One possible way of solving these problems is to invoke (so-called) warm dark matter (WDM) particles with masses $m_x \sim$ keV. Since the formation of structure is delayed in such WDM models, it is natural to expect that they can be constrained using observations related to the first stars, e.g., the 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn. In this work, we use a detailed galaxy formation model, Delphi, to calculate the 21 cm signal at high-redshifts and compare this to the recent EDGES observations. We find that while CDM and 5 keV WDM models can obtain a 21 cm signal within the observed redshift range, reproducing the amplitude of the observations requires the introduction of an excess radio background. On the other hand, WDM models with $m_x \leq 3$ keV can be ruled out since they are unable to match either the redshift range or the amplitude of the EDGES signal, irrespective of the parameters used. Comparable to values obtained from the low-redshift Lyman Alpha forest, our results extend constraints on the WDM particle to an era inaccessible by any other means; additional forthcoming 21 cm data from the era of cosmic dawn will be crucial in refining such constraints.","Atrideb Chatterjee, Pratika Dayal, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anne Hutter",Accepted to MNRAS,1902.09562v2,No journal ref found,Anne Hutter,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09562v2,2019-02-25 19:00:36+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA|hep-ph,Ruling out 3 keV warm dark matter using 21 cm-EDGES data,2019-05-22 15:03:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09562v2
96,"If the progenitor of GW170817 harbored a pulsar, then a Poynting flux dominated bow-shock cavity would have been expected to form around the traveling binary. The characteristic size of this evacuated region depends strongly on the spin-down evolution of the pulsar companion, which in turn depends on the merging timescale of the system. If this evacuated region is able to grow to a sufficiently large scale, then the deceleration of the jet, and thus the onset of the afterglow, would be noticeably delayed. The first detection of afterglow emission, which was uncovered 9.2 days after the $\gamma$-ray burst trigger, can thus be used to constrain the size of a pre-existing pulsar-wind cavity. We use this information, together with a model of the jet to place limits on the presence of a pulsar in GW170817 and discuss the derived constraints in the context of the observed double neutron star binary population. From our results, we conclude that the recently detected system J1913$+$1102 provides a good Milky Way analog of GW170817's progenitor system. This study highlights the potential of the proposed observational test for gaining insight into the origin of double neutron star binaries.","Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Jeff J. Andrews, Sophie L.

97,"Using the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) equation of state (EoS) from lattice calculations we investigate effects from QCD on primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) produced during the inflationary era. We also consider different cases for vanishing and nonvanishing lepton asymmetry where the latter one is constrained by cosmic microwave background experiments. Our results show that there is up to a few percent deviation in the predicted gravitational wave background in the frequency range around the QCD transition ($10^{-10}- 10^{-7}$~Hz) for different lattice QCD EoSs, or at larger frequencies for nonvanishing lepton asymmetry using perturbative QCD. Future gravitational wave experiments with high enough sensitivity in the measurement of the amplitude of PGWs like SKA, EPTA, DECIGO and LISA can probe these differences and can shed light on the real nature of the cosmic QCD transition and the existence of a nonvanishing lepton asymmetry in the early universe.","Fazlollah Hajkarim, JÃ¼rgen Schaffner-Bielich, Stephan Wystub, Mandy M.

98,"The thermal evolution of hypernuclear compact stars is studied for stellar models constructed on the basis of covariant density functional theory in Hartree and Hartree-Fock approximation. Parametrizations of both types are consistent with the astrophysical mass constraints on compact stars and available hypernuclear data. We discuss the differences of these density functionals and highlight the effects they have on the composition and on the cooling of hypernuclear stars. It is shown that hypernuclear stars computed with density functional models that have a low symmetry energy slope, $L$, are fairly consistent with the cooling data of observed compact stars. The class of stellar models based on larger $L$ values gives rise to the direct Urca process at low densities, which leads to significantly faster cooling. We conjecture high-density pairing for protons and $\Lambda$'s in the $P$-wave channel and provide simple scaling arguments to obtain these gaps. As a consequence the most massive stellar models with masses $1.8 \le M/M_{\odot} \le2$ experience slower cooling by hyperonic dUrca processes which involve $\Lambda$'s and protons.","Adriana R.

99,"We develop a magnetohydrodynamical model of Alfv\'en wave-driven wind in open magnetic flux tubes piercing the stellar surface of Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, and investigate the physical properties of the winds. The model simulations are carried out along the evolutionary tracks of stars with initial mass in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 $M_{\odot}$ and initial metallicity $Z_{\rm ini}$=0.02. The surface magnetic field strength being set to be 1G, we find that the wind during the evolution of star can be classified into the following four types; the first is the wind with the velocity higher than 80 km s$^{-1}$ in the RGB and early AGB (E-AGB) phases; the second is the wind with outflow velocity less than 10 km s$^{-1}$ seen around the tip of RGB or in the E-AGB phase; the third is the unstable wind in the E-AGB and thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phases; the fourth is the stable massive and slow wind with the mass-loss rate higher than 10$^{-7} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the outflow velocity lower than 20 km s$^{-1}$ in the TP-AGB phase. The mass-loss rates in the first and second types of wind are two or three orders of magnitude lower than the values evaluated by an empirical formula. The presence of massive and slow wind of the fourth type suggests the possibility that the massive outflow observed in TP-AGB stars could be attributed to the Alfv\'en wave-driven wind.","Y.

101,"We present a comparison between three cluster models applied to data obtained by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager radio interferometer system. The physical model (PM) parameterises a cluster in terms of its physical quantities to model the dark matter and baryonic components of the cluster using NFW and GNFW profiles respectively. The observational models (OM I and OM II) model only the gas content of the cluster. The two OMs vary only in the priors they use in Bayesian inference: OM I has a joint prior on angular radius $\theta$ and integrated Comptonisation $Y$, derived from simulations, while OM II uses separable priors on $\theta$ and $Y$ which are based on calculations of the physical model. For the comparison we consider a sample of $54$ clusters which are a subsample of the second Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources. We first compare the $Y$ estimates of the three models, and find that the PM generally yields lower estimates relative to the OMs. We then compute the Earth Mover's Distance between the $\theta$ - $Y$ posterior distributions obtained from each model for each cluster, and find that the two models which are most discrepant are PM and OM I. Finally, we compare the Bayesian evidence values obtained from each model for each cluster. OM I generally provides the best fit to the data but not at a statistically significant level, according to the Jeffreys scale. The highest evidence ratio obtained is actually in favour of the PM over OM I.","Kamran Javid, Yvette C. Perrott, Michael P. Hobson, Malak Olamaie, Clare Rumsey, Richard D. E.

In this paper we present the first results obtained from a radio continuum map of a 16 square degree sized region of the Galactic plane centered on $\textit{l} = 32^{\circ}$ and $b = 0^{\circ}$ ($28^{\circ} < \textit{l} < 36^{\circ}$ and $|b| < 1^{\circ}$).

Two 1 GHz wide sub-bands were observed simultaneously and centred at 4.7 and 6.9 GHz. These data were calibrated and imaged using the $\textit{Obit}$ software package. The source extraction has been performed using the BLOBCAT software package and verified through a combination of visual inspection and cross-matching with other radio and mid-infrared surveys. The final catalog consists of 1575 discrete radio sources and 27 large scale structures (including W43 and W44). By cross-matching with other catalogs and calculating the spectral indices ($S(\nu) \propto \nu^\alpha$), we have classified 231 continuum sources as HII regions, 37 as ionization fronts, and 46 as planetary nebulae. The longitude and latitude distribution and negative spectral indices are all consistent with the vast majority of the unclassified sources being extragalactic background sources. We present a catalog of 1575 radio continuum sources and discuss their physical properties, emission nature and relation with previously reported.

103,"We present a comparison of mass estimates for $54$ galaxy cluster candidates from the second Planck catalogue (PSZ2) of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources. We compare the mass values obtained with data taken from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) radio interferometer system and from the Planck satellite. The former of these uses a Bayesian analysis pipeline that parameterises a cluster in terms of its physical quantities, and models the dark matter & baryonic components of a cluster using NFW and GNFW profiles respectively. Our mass estimates derived from Planck data are obtained from the results of the Bayesian detection algorithm PowellSnakes (PwS), are based on the methodology detailed in the PSZ2 paper, and produce two sets of mass estimates; one estimate is calculated directly from the angular radius $\theta$ - integrated Comptonisation parameter $Y$ posterior distributions, and the other uses a `slicing function' to provide information on $\theta$ based on X-ray measurements and previous Planck mission samples. We find that for $37$ of the clusters, the AMI mass estimates are lower than both values obtained from Planck data. However the AMI and slicing function estimates are within one combined standard deviation of each other for $31$ clusters. We also generate cluster simulations based on the slicing-function mass estimates, and analyse them in the same way as we did the real AMI data. We find that inclusion in the simulations of radio-source confusion & CMB noise and measurable radio-sources causes AMI mass estimates to be systematically low.","Kamran Javid, Malak Olamaie, Yvette C.

105,"We apply, for the first time, the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm to search for new transiting exoplanets. TLS is a successor to the Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm, which has served as a standard tool for the detection of periodic transits. In this proof-of-concept paper, we demonstrate how TLS finds small planets that have previously been missed. We showcase TLS' capabilities using the K2 EVEREST-detrended light curve of the star K2-32 (EPIC205071984) that was known to have three transiting planets. TLS detects these known Neptune-sized planets K2-32b, d, and c in an iterative search and finds an additional transit signal with a high signal detection efficiency (SDE_TLS) of 26.1 at a period of 4.34882 (-0.00075, +0.00069) d. We show that this signal remains detectable (SDE_TLS = 13.2) with TLS in the K2SFF light curve of K2-32, which includes a less optimal detrending of the systematic trends. The signal is below common detection thresholds, however, if searched with BLS in the K2SFF light curve (SDE_BLS = 8.9) as in previous searches. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling shows that the radius of this candidate is 1.01 (-0.09, +0.10) Earth radii. We analyze its phase-folded transit light curve using the vespa software and calculate a false positive probability FPP = 3.1e-3, formally validating K2-32e as a planet. Taking into account the multiplicity boost of the system, FPP < 3.1e-4. K2-32 now hosts at least four planets that are very close to a 1:2:5:7 mean motion resonance chain. The offset of the orbital periods of K2-32e and b from a 1:2 mean motion resonance is in very good agreement with the sample of transiting multi-planet systems from Kepler, lending further credence to the planetary nature of K2-32e. We expect that TLS can find many more transits of Earth-sized and smaller planets in the Kepler data that have hitherto remained undetected with BLS and similar algorithms.","RenÃ© Heller, Kai Rodenbeck, Michael Hippke","published in A&A, Vol. 625, id.

106,"We have computed a grid of hydrostatic spherical COMARCS models for C stars covering metallicities from [Z/H]=0 to -2 and values of the carbon excess [C-O] from 6.41 to 9.15, plus some temperature sequences, where the amount of oxygen and nitrogen is increased relative to a scaled solar element mixture. Such abundance variations may appear during the late stages of stellar evolution. Our study covers changes of [O/Z] and [N/Z] going up to +0.5. Based on the atmospheric structures we have calculated synthetic spectra and photometry for all of the models in a consistent way.   The sequences with changed [O/Z] and [N/Z] can be used to derive correction terms, which are applied to the colours predicted for a certain combination of effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and carbon excess. If one neglects these shifts in case of a variable oxygen amount, taking [C-O] instead of C/O gives much better results, since the first quantity dominates the formation of many important molecular species. For the warmer C giants with weaker pulsation it is in principle possible to determine [C-O], [O/Z] or [N/Z] from high resolution spectra, when the opacities in the radiative transfer calculations for the models and observable properties are treated consistently. The corresponding changes due to the abundances often become significantly larger than the deviations caused by uncertainties of the stellar parameters or by a optically thin dust shell. Photometric data and low or medium resolution spectra are not sufficient to derive the mentioned quantities.","Bernhard Aringer, Paola Marigo, Walter Nowotny, Leo Girardi, Marko Mecina, Ambra Nanni","MNRAS, accepted",1905.09106v1,No journal ref found,Ambra Nanni,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09106v1,2019-05-22 12:38:50+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Carbon stars with increased oxygen and nitrogen abundances: hydrostatic   dust-free model atmospheres,2019-05-22 12:38:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09106v1
107,"It has been a common assumption of interior models that the outer planets of our solar system are convective, and that the internal temperature distributions are therefore adiabatic. This assumption is also often applied to exoplanets. However, if a large portion of the thermal flux can be transferred by conduction, or if convection is inhibited, the thermal profile could be substantially different and would therefore affect the inferred planetary composition. Here we investigate how the assumption of non-adiabatic temperature profiles in Uranus and Neptune affects their internal structures and compositions. We use a set of plausible temperature profiles together with density profiles that match the measured gravitational fields to derive the planets' compositions. We find that the inferred compositions of both Uranus and Neptune are quite sensitive to the assumed thermal profile in the outer layers, but relatively insensitive to the thermal profile in the central, high pressure region. The overall value of the heavy element mass fraction, $Z$, for these planets is between 0.8 and 0.9. Finally, we suggest that large parts of Uranus' interior might be conductive, a conclusion that is consistent with Uranus dynamo models and a hot central inner region.","Morris Podolak, Ravit Helled, Gerald Schubert","40 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures, to appear in MNRAS",1905.09099v1,No journal ref found,Gerald Schubert,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09099v1,2019-05-22 12:24:54+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Effect of Non-Adiabatic Thermal Profiles on the Inferred Compositions of   Uranus and Neptune,2019-05-22 12:24:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09099v1
108,"The rotation axis of the Sun is misaligned from the mean angular momentum plane of the Solar system by about 6 degrees. This obliquity significantly exceeds the ~1-2 degree distribution of inclinations among the planetary orbits and therefore requires a physical explanation. In concert, Sun-like stars are known to spin down by an order of magnitude throughout their lifetimes. This spin-down is driven by the stellar wind, which carries angular momentum from the star. If the mean angular momentum axis of the stellar wind deviates from that of the stellar spin axis, it will lead to a component of the spin-down torque that acts to tilt the star. Here, we show that Solar-like tilts of 6 degrees naturally arise during the first 10-100 Myr after planet formation as a result of stellar winds that deviate by about 10 degrees from the star's spin axis. These results apply to the idealized case of a dipolar field, mildly inclined to the spin axis. Time-variability in the misalignment between the magnetic and spin poles is modeled as stochastic fluctuations, autocorrelated over timescales comparable to the primordial spin-down time of several million years. In addition to wind direction, time-variability in mass-loss rate and magnetic topology over the stellar lifetime may alternatively generate obliquity. We hypothesize that the gaseous environments of young, open clusters may provide forcing over sufficient timescales to tilt the astrospheres of young stars, exciting modest obliquities. The more extreme, retrograde stellar obliquities of extrasolar planetary systems likely arise through separate mechanisms.",Christopher Spalding,"13 pages, 8 figures, Accepted to The Astrophysical Journal",1905.09094v1,No journal ref found,Christopher Spalding,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09094v1,2019-05-22 12:08:21+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.EP,Stellar winds as a mechanism to tilt the spin axes of Sun-like stars,2019-05-22 12:08:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09094v1

110,"We present the results of a study utilising ultra-deep, rest-frame UV, spectroscopy to quantify the relationship between stellar mass and stellar metallicity for 681 star-forming galaxies at $2.5<z<5.0$ ($\langle z \rangle = 3.5 \pm 0.6$) drawn from the VANDELS survey. Via a comparison with high-resolution stellar population models, we determine stellar metallicities for a set of composite spectra formed from subsamples selected by mass and redshift. Across the stellar mass range $8.5 < \mathrm{log}(\langle M_{\ast} \rangle/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.2$ we find a strong correlation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing from $Z_{\ast}/\mathrm{Z}_{\odot} < 0.09$ at $\langle M_{\ast} \rangle = 3.2 \times 10^{8} \rm{M}_{\odot}$ to $Z_{\ast}/Z_{\odot} = 0.27$ at $\langle M_{\ast} \rangle = 1.7 \times 10^{10} \rm{M}_{\odot}$. In contrast, at a given stellar mass, we find no evidence for significant metallicity evolution across the redshift range of our sample. However, comparing our results to the $z=0$ stellar mass-metallicity relation, we find that the $\langle z \rangle = 3.5$ relation is consistent with being shifted to lower metallicities by $\simeq 0.6$ dex. Contrasting our derived stellar metallicities with estimates of gas-phase metallicities at similar redshifts, we find evidence for enhanced $\rm{O}/\rm{Fe}$ ratios of the order (O/Fe) $\gtrsim 1.8$ $\times$ (O/Fe)$_{\odot}$. Finally, by comparing our results to simulation predictions, we find that the $\langle z \rangle = 3.5$ stellar mass-metallicity relation is consistent with current predictions for how outflow strength scales with galaxy mass.

We calculate the angular size of the shadow measured by cosmological comoving observers by projecting the shadow angle to this observer rest frame. We show that the shadow size tends to zero as the observer approaches the cosmological horizon. We estimate the angular size of the shadow for a typical supermassive black hole, e.g M87. It is found that the angular size of the shadow for cosmological observers and static observers is approximately the same at these scales of mass and distance.","Javad T.

112,"We present the multifractal study of the intermittency of the magnetic field turbulence in the fast and slow solar wind beyond the ecliptic plane during two solar minima (1997-1998, 2007-2008) and solar maximum (1999-2001). More precisely, we consider 126 time intervals of Ulysses magnetic field measurements, obtain the multifractal spectra, and examine the degree of multifractality as the measure of intermittency in the MHD range of scales, for a wide range of heliocentric distances and heliolatitudes. The results show a slow decrease of intermittency with the radial distance, which is more significant for the fast than for the slow solar wind. Analysis of Alfvenic and compressive fuctuations confirms the decrease of intermittency with distance and latitude. This radial dependence of multifractality/intermittency may be explained by a slower evolution of turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane and by the reduced efficiency of intermittency drivers with the distance from the Sun. Additionally, our analysis shows that the greatest differences between magnetic field components are revealed close to the Sun, where intermittency is the strongest. Moreover, we observe that the slow solar wind from the maximum of the solar cycle 23 exhibits in general, a lower level of multifractality (intermittency) than fast solar wind, which can be related to the idea of a new type of Alfvenic slow solar wind.","Anna Wawrzaszek, Marius Echim, Roberto Bruno","17 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables",1905.09066v1,No journal ref found,Roberto Bruno,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09066v1,2019-05-22 10:57:34+00:00,physics.space-ph,physics.space-ph|astro-ph.SR|physics.plasm-ph,Multifractal Analysis of Heliospheric Magnetic Field Fluctuations   observed by Ulysses,2019-05-22 10:57:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09066v1
113,"One of the main considerations in the ALMA Development Roadmap for the future of operations beyond 2030 is to at least double its on-sky instantaneous bandwidth capabilities. Thanks to the technological innovations of the past two decades, we can now produce wider bandwidth receivers than were foreseen at the time of the original ALMA specifications. In several cases, the band edges set by technology at that time are also no longer relevant. In this memo, we look into the scientific advantages of beginning with Band 2 when implementing such wideband technologies. The Band 2 receiver system will be the last of the original ALMA bands, completing ALMA's coverage of the atmospheric windows from 35-950 GHz, and is not yet covered by any other ALMA receiver. New receiver designs covering and significantly extending the original ALMA Band 2 frequency range (67-90 GHz) can now implement these technologies. We explore the scientific and operational advantages of a receiver covering the full 67-116 GHz atmospheric window. In addition to technological goals, the ALMA Development Roadmap provides 3 new key science drivers for ALMA, to probe: 1) the Origins of Galaxies, 2) the Origins of Chemical Complexity, and 3) the Origins of Planets. In this memo, we describe how the wide RF Band 2 system can help achieve these goals, enabling several high-profile science programmes to be executed uniquely or more effectively than with separate systems, requiring an overall much lower array time and achieving more consistent calibration accuracy: contiguous broad-band spectral surveys, measurements of deuterated line ratios, and more generally fractionation studies, improved continuum measurements (also necessary for reliable line flux measurements), simultaneous broad-band observations of transient phenomena, and improved bandwidth for 3 mm very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).","Tony Mroczkowski, Carlos De Breuck, Ciska Kemper, Neil Phillips, Gary Fuller, Maite BeltrÃ¡n, Robert Laing, Gianni Marconi, Leonardo Testi, Pavel Yagoubov, Danielle George, William McGenn","ALMA Memo Series #605.

A dedicated temperature measurement subsystem, with noise levels in 10$\,\mu$K$\,$Hz$^{-1/2}$ down to $1\,$mHz was part of the diagnostics unit on board LPF. In this paper we report on the temperature measurements throughout mission operations, characterize the thermal environment, estimate transfer functions between different locations and report temperature stability (and its time evolution) at frequencies as low as 10$\,\mu$Hz, where typically values around $1\,$K$\,$Hz$^{-1/2}$ were measured.","M.

115,"The extended Kepler mission (K2) has revealed more than 500 transiting planets in roughly 500,000 stellar light curves. All of these were found either with the box least-squares algorithm or by visual inspection. Here we use our new transit least-squares (TLS) algorithm to search for additional planets around all K2 stars that are currently known to host at least one planet. We discover and statistically validate 17 new planets with radii ranging from about 0.7 Earth radii to roughly 2.2 Earth radii and a median radius of 1.18 Earth radii. EPIC201497682.03, with a radius of 0.692 (-0.048, +0.059) Earth radii, is the second smallest planet ever discovered with K2. The transit signatures of these 17 planets are typically 200 ppm deep (ranging from 100 ppm to 2000 ppm), and their orbital periods extend from about 0.7 d to 34 d with a median value of about 4 d. Fourteen of these 17 systems only had one known planet before, and they now join the growing number of multi-planet systems. Most stars in our sample have subsolar masses and radii. The small planetary radii in our sample are a direct result of the higher signal detection efficiency that TLS has compared to box-fitting algorithms in the shallow-transit regime. Our findings help in populating the period-radius diagram with small planets. Our discovery rate of about 3 % within the group of previously known K2 systems suggests that TLS can find over 100 additional Earth-sized planets in the data of the Kepler primary mission.","RenÃ© Heller, Michael Hippke, Kai Rodenbeck","in press at A&A, 12 pages, 6 colored Figures, 1 Table",1905.09038v1,No journal ref found,Kai Rodenbeck,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09038v1,2019-05-22 09:30:49+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Transit least-squares survey - II.

116,"We introduce AXS (Astronomy eXtensions for Spark), a scalable open-source astronomical data analysis framework built on Apache Spark, a widely used industry-standard engine for big data processing. Building on capabilities present in Spark, AXS aims to enable querying and analyzing almost arbitrarily large astronomical catalogs using familiar Python/AstroPy concepts, DataFrame APIs, and SQL statements. We achieve this by i) adding support to Spark for efficient on-line positional cross-matching and ii) supplying a Python library supporting commonly-used operations for astronomical data analysis. To support scalable cross-matching, we developed a variant of the ZONES algorithm \citep{there-goes_gray_2004} capable of operating in distributed, shared-nothing architecture. We couple this to a data partitioning scheme that enables fast catalog cross-matching and handles the data skew often present in deep all-sky data sets. The cross-match and other often-used functionalities are exposed to the end users through an easy-to-use Python API. We demonstrate AXS' technical and scientific performance on SDSS, ZTF, Gaia DR2, and AllWise catalogs. Using AXS we were able to perform on-the-fly cross-match of Gaia DR2 (1.8 billion rows) and AllWise (900 million rows) data sets in ~ 30 seconds. We discuss how cloud-ready distributed systems like AXS provide a natural way to enable comprehensive end-user analyses of large datasets such as LSST.","Petar ZeÄeviÄ, Colin T.

Four optical sources have been identified as possible counterparts within the 2$\sigma$ error radius of 0.3 arcsec in the images. However, only two of them were investigated as candidates for counterparts due to their point-like features and their identification in various filters. These two faint candidates have absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm V}$ $\approx$ -3.4 and -3.7. Also possible spectral classes of them were determined as B type main sequence stars. The ages and the masses of the candidates from Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) were estimated as 45 Myr and 7 $M_{\rm \odot}$, respectively. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of two candidates were modeled by a power-law spectrum with a photon index ($\alpha$) $\sim$1.5. The spectra with such slopes could be interpreted as an evidence of reprocessing of the X-rays in the outer part of the disk that generates optical emission.","N. Aksaker, A. AkyÃ¼z, S. Avdan, H.

118,"The magnetic field shapes the structure of the solar corona but we still know little about the interrelationships between the coronal magnetic field configurations and the resulting quasi-stationary structures observed in coronagraphic images (as streamers, plumes, coronal holes). One way to obtain information on the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic field is to extrapolate it from photospheric data and compare the results with coronagraphic images. Our aim is to verify if this comparison can be a fast method to check systematically the reliability of the many methods available to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field. Coronal fields are usually extrapolated from photospheric measurements typically in a region close to the central meridian on the solar disk and then compared with coronagraphic images at the limbs, acquired at least 7 days before or after to account for solar rotation, implicitly assuming that no significant changes occurred in the corona during that period. In this work, we combine images from three coronagraphs (SOHO/LASCO-C2 and the two STEREO/SECCHI-COR1) observing the Sun from different viewing angles to build Carrington maps covering the entire corona to reduce the effect of temporal evolution to ~ 5 days. We then compare the position of the observed streamers in these Carrington maps with that of the neutral lines obtained from four different magnetic field extrapolations, to evaluate the performances of the latter in the solar corona. Our results show that the location of coronal streamers can provide important indications to discriminate between different magnetic field extrapolations.","C. Sasso, R. F. Pinto, V. Andretta, R. A.

119,"With large-scale galaxy surveys, we can observe hundreds of thousands of galaxies or more, up to billions with upcoming experiments such as WFIRST, Euclid and LSST. While such surveys cannot obtain spectra for all observed galaxies, we have access to the galaxy magnitudes in color filters. This data set behaves like a high-dimensional nonlinear surface, making it an excellent target for machine learning methods. In this work, we use a lightcone of semianalytic galaxies tuned to match CANDELS observations from Lu et al. (2014) to train a set of neural networks on a set of galaxy properties (stellar mass, metallicity, and average star formation rate) using the truth values from the semianalytic catalogs. We also demonstrate the effect of adding simulated observational noise to the simulated magnitudes, and then use neural networks trained on the noisy data to predict stellar masses, metallicities, and average star formation rates on real CANDELS galaxies, comparing our results to the physical parameters obtained from SED fitting. On semianalytic galaxies alone, we are nearly competitive with template-fitting methods. For the observed CANDELS data, our results are not as accurate, with indications that this inaccuracy is due to a combination of different assumptions in template-fitting and differences between the semianalytic models and the observed galaxies, particularly in the noise properties. Our results show that stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate can in principle be measured with neural networks at a competitive degree of accuracy and precision relative to physically motivated template-fitting methods if an appropriate training set can be obtained.","Melanie Simet, Nima Chartab Soltani, Yu Lu, Bahram Mobasher","15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

120,"Spiral galaxies comprise three major structural components; thin discs, thick discs, and central bulges. Relative dominance of these components is known to correlate with the total mass of the galaxy, and produces a remarkable morphological variety of spiral galaxies. Although there are many formation scenarios regarding individual components, no unified theory exists which explains this systematic variation. The cold-flow hypothesis predicts that galaxies grow by accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs (cold accretion) when their mass is below a certain threshold, whereas in the high-mass regime the gas that entered the dark matter halo is first heated by shock waves to high temperatures and then accretes to the forming galaxy as it cools emitting radiation (cooling flow). This hypothesis also predicts that massive galaxies at high redshifts have a hybrid accretion structure in which filaments of cold inflowing gas penetrate surrounding hot gas. In the case of Milky Way, the previous study suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in early times and the cooling flow formed the thin disc in later epochs. Here we report that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses and associating the hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed mass-dependent structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies have lower thick disc mass fractions and higher bulge mass fractions. The proposed scenario predicts that thick discs are older in age and poorer in iron than thin discs, the trend observed in the Milky Way (MW) and other spiral galaxies.",Masafumi Noguchi,"15 pages, 4 figures and 1 extended figure",1905.08993v1,No journal ref found,Masafumi Noguchi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08993v1,2019-05-22 07:25:12+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Morphological diversity of spiral galaxies originating in the cold gas   inflow from cosmic webs,2019-05-22 07:25:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08993v1

Despite of the small overlap of $140$ deg$^2$ between these surveys we detect the filament lensing signal at 3.9$\sigma$ significance, which is the highest signal-to-noise lensing measurement of filaments between galaxy-scale halos at this redshift range. We derive a theoretical prediction and covariance using mock catalogues based on full-sky ray-tracing simulations. We find that the intrinsic scatter of filament properties and the fluctuations in large scale structure along the line-of-sight are the primary component of the covariance and the intrinsic shape noise from source galaxies no longer limits our lensing measurement. This fact demonstrates the statistical power of the HSC survey due to its deep observations and high number density of source galaxies. Our result is consistent with the theoretical prediction and supports the ""thick"" filament model. As the HSC survey area increases, we will be able to study detailed filament properties such as the dark matter distributions and redshift evolution of filaments.","Hiroto Kondo, Hironao Miyatake, Masato Shirasaki, Naoshi Sugiyama, Atsushi J.

122,"The accretion-driven outbursts of young FU Orionis-type stars may be a common stage of pre-main sequence evolution and can have a significant impact on the circumstellar environment as it pertains to the growth of solids and eventually planets. This episodic accretion is thought to be sustained by additional gas in-falling from the circumstellar envelope and disk. We present APEX observations of the CO gas in the envelope around V883 Orionis, a young outbursting star. The observations mapped the $^{12}$CO(4-3), $^{12}$CO(3-2), and $^{13}$CO(3-2) lines with the FLASH$^{+}$ instrument and the $^{12}$CO(6-5) line with the SEPIA instrument. We detected high signal-to-noise emission extending out to radii $>10000$ au and calculated integrated fluxes of $1100~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(6-5), $2400~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(4-3), $1600~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(3-2), and $450~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{13}$CO(3-2).

123,"How Supermassive Blackholes (SMBHs) are spun-up is a key issue of modern astrophysics. As an extension of the study in Wang et al. (2016), we here address the issue by comparing the host galaxy properties of nearby ($z<0.05$) radio-selected Seyfert 2 galaxies. With the two-dimensional bulge+disk decompositions for the SDSS $r$-band images, we identify a dichotomy on various host galaxy properties for the radio-powerful SMBHs. By assuming the radio emission from the jet reflects a high SMBH spin, which stems from the well-known BZ mechanism of jet production, high-mass SMBHs (i.e., $M_{\mathrm{BH}}>10^{7.9}M_\odot$) have a preference for being spun-up in classical bulges, and low-mass SMBHs (i.e., $M_{\mathrm{BH}}=10^{6-7}M_\odot$) in pseudo-bulges. This dichotomy suggests and confirms that high-mass and low-mass SMBHs are spun-up in different ways, i.e., a major ""dry"" merger and a secular evolution.","J. Wang, M. Z. Kong, S. F. Liu, D. W.

124,"To investigate how the abundance of N2H+ varies as massive clumps evolve, here we present a multi-wavelength study toward six molecular clouds. All of these clouds contain several massive clumps in different evolutionary stages of star formation. Using archival data of Herschel InfraRed Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL), we made H2 column density and dust temperature maps of these regions by the spectral energy distribution (SED) method. We found all of the six clouds show distinct dust temperature gradients, ranging from 20 K to 30 K. This makes them good candidates to study chemical evolution of molecules (such as N2H+) in different evolutionary stages of star formation. Our molecular line data come from Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90 GHz (MALT90). We made column density and then abundance maps of N2H+. We found that when the dust temperature is above 27 K, the abundance of N2H+ begins to decrease or reaches a plateau. We regard this is because that in the photodissociation regions (PDRs) around classical HII regions, N2H+ is destroyed by free electrons heavily. However, when the dust temperature is below 27 K, the abundance of N2H+ increases with dust temperature. This seems to be inconsistent with previous chemical models made in low-mass star-forming regions. In order to check out whether this inconsistency is caused by a different chemistry in high-mass star-forming clumps, higher angular resolution observations are necessary.","Nai-Ping Yu, Jin-Long Xu, Jun-Jie Wang, Xiao-Lan Liu",No comment found,1905.08976v1,No journal ref found,Xiao-Lan Liu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08976v1,2019-05-22 06:37:23+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Chemical evolution of N2H+ in six massive star-forming regions,2019-05-22 06:37:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08976v1

Taking advantage of MMS ion data, having a resolution never reached before in space missions, and of the comparison with Vlasov-Maxwell simulations, this analysis aims at relating any deviation from Maxwellian equilibrium to typical plasma parameters. Correlations of the non-Maxwellian features with plasma quantities such as electric fields, ion temperature, current density and ion vorticity are very similar in both magnetosheath data and numerical experiments, and suggest that distortions in the ion VDFs occur close to (but not exactly at) peaks in current density and ion temperature.

126,"We report evidence for star formation quenching in the central 8.6 kpc region of the jellyfish galaxy JO201 which hosts an active galactic nucleus, while undergoing strong ram pressure stripping. The ultraviolet imaging data of the galaxy disk reveal a region with reduced flux around the center of the galaxy and a horse shoe shaped region with enhanced flux in the outer disk. The characterization of the ionization regions based on emission line diagnostic diagrams shows that the region of reduced flux seen in the ultraviolet is within the AGN-dominated area. The CO J$_{2-1}$ map of the galaxy disk reveals a cavity in the central region. The image of the galaxy disk at redder wavelengths (9050-9250 {\AA}) reveals the presence of a stellar bar. The star formation rate map of the galaxy disk shows that the star formation suppression in the cavity occurred in the last few 10$^8$ yr. We present several lines of evidence supporting the scenario that suppression of star formation in the central region of the disk is most likely due to the feedback from the AGN. The observations reported here make JO201 a unique case of AGN feedback and environmental effects suppressing star formation in a spiral galaxy.","Koshy George, B. M. Poggianti, C. Bellhouse, M.

127,"The GASP survey, based on MUSE data, is unveiling the properties of the gas in the so-called ""jellyfish"" galaxies: these are cluster galaxies with spectacular evidence of gas stripping by ram pressure. In a previous paper, we selected the seven GASP galaxies with the most extended tentacles of ionized gas, and based on individual diagnostic diagrams concluded that at least five of them present clear evidence for an Active Galactic Nucleus. Here we present a more detailed analysis of the emission lines properties in these galaxies. Our comparison of several emission line ratios with both AGN and shock models show that photoionization by the AGN is the dominant ionization mechanism. This conclusion is strengthened by the analysis of $\rm H\beta$ luminosities, the presence of nuclear iron coronal lines and extended ($>10$ kpc) emission line regions ionized by the AGN in some of these galaxies. From emission line profiles, we find the presence of outflows in four galaxies, and derive mass outflow rates, timescales and kinetic energy of the outflows.","Mario Radovich, Bianca Poggianti, Yara L.

128,"Galaxy filaments are a peculiar environment, and their impact on the galaxy properties is still controversial. Exploiting the data from the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP), we provide the first characterisation of the spatially resolved properties of galaxies embedded in filaments in the local Universe. The four galaxies we focus on show peculiar ionised gas distributions: Halpha clouds have been observed beyond four times the effective radius. The gas kinematics, metallicity map and the ratios of emission line fluxes confirm that they do belong to the galaxy gas disk, the analysis of their spectra shows that very weak stellar continuum is associated to them. Similarly, the star formation history and luminosity weighted age maps point to a recent formation of such clouds. The clouds are powered by star formation, and are characterised by intermediate values of dust absorption. We hypothesise a scenario in which the observed features are due to ""Cosmic Web Enhancement"": we are most likely witnessing galaxies passing through or flowing within filaments that assist the gas cooling and increase the extent of the star formation in the densest regions in the circumgalactic gas.

A linear relation between the average CME speed below 6 solar radii and the flux rope current is demonstrated and used to tune the simulations. The simulations correctly predict if and when an observable CME shock reaches one astronomical unit (AU). The arrival time predictions of the CME shocks at 1 AU have an accuracy of 0.9 $\pm$ 1.9 hours. The simulated initial CME speeds and average accelerations are close to the model and data of Gopalswamy et al., 2000.

Maps of all the observed lines were also obtained. Comparisons with a number of early starless cores and WCCC source L1527 show that the column densities of C4H and CH3CCH are close to those of L1527, and the CH3CCH column densities of the EMC and L1527 are slightly higher than those of TMC-1. The EMC and L1527 have similar C3S column densities, but they are much lower than those of all the starless cores, with only 6.5% and 10% of the TMC-1 value, respectively. The emissions of the N-bearing species of the EMC and L1527 are at the medium level of the starless cores. These comparisons show that the CCM emissions in the EMC are similar to those of L1527, though L1527 contains a protostar. Although dark and quiescent, the EMC is warmer and at a later evolutionary stage than classical carbon-chain--producing regions in the cold, dark, quiescent early phase. The PACS, SPIRE, and SCUBA maps evidently show that the L1489 IRS seems to be the heating source of the EMC.

131,"We investigate a scenario where the formation of Globular Clusters (GCs) is triggered by high-speed collisions between infalling atomic-cooling subhalos during the assembly of the main galaxy host, a special dynamical mode of star formation that operates at high gas pressures and is intimately tied to LCDM hierarchical galaxy assembly. The proposed mechanism would give origin to ""naked"" globulars, as colliding dark matter subhalos and their stars will simply pass through one another while the warm gas within them clashes at highly supersonic speed and decouples from the collisionless component, in a process reminiscent of the Bullet galaxy cluster. We find that the resulting shock-compressed layer cools on a timescale that is tipically shorter than the crossing time, first by atomic line emission and then via fine-structure metal-line emission, and is subject to gravitational instability and fragmentation. Through a combination of kinetic theory approximation and high-resolution N-body simulations, we show that this model may produce: (a) a GC number-halo mass relation that is linear down to dwarf galaxy scales and agrees with the trend observed over five orders of magnitude in galaxy mass; (b) a population of old globulars with a median age of 12 Gyr and an age spread similar to that observed; (c) a spatial distribution that is biased relative to the overall mass profile of the host. This is because, in an inelastic collision, the splash remnant will lose orbital energy and fall deeper into the Galactic potential rather than sharing the orbits of the progenitor subhalos; and (d) a bimodal metallicity distribution with a spread similar to that observed in massive galaxies. Additional, hydrodynamic simulations of subhalo-subhalo high-speed impacts should be performed to further validate a collision-driven scenario for the formation of GCs.","Piero Madau, Alessandro Lupi, Juerg Diemand, Andreas Burkert, Douglas N.

The vertical structure was also indicated by comparing the results at two different emission angles. From the long-term data, dynamical wave modes consisting of tides were identified; the diurnal tide consists mainly of a Rossby-wave mode and a gravity-wave mode, while the semidiurnal tide predominantly consists of a gravity-wave mode. The suggested vertical structures are roughly consistent with the wave modes, but some discrepancy remains if the waves are supposed to be monochromatic. In turn, this discrepancy indicates that a future study should constrain the heating profile that excites the tidal waves, which would greatly advance the understanding of the Venusian atmosphere.","T.

134,"Accurate galaxy cluster mass measurements from the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps depend on mitigating potential biases from the cluster's own thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal. Quadratic lensing estimators use a pair of maps to extract the lensing signal: a large scale gradient map and a small scale lensing map. The SZ bias can be eliminated by using an SZ-free map in the pair, with the gradient map being favored for signal-to-noise reasons. However, while this approach eliminates the bias, the SZ power in small scale lensing map adds extra variance that can become significant for high mass clusters and low noise surveys. In this work, we propose projecting out an SZ template to reduce the SZ variance. Any residual SZ signal after template fitting is uncorrelated with the SZ-free gradient map, and thus does not bias the mass measurements. For massive clusters above $4\times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ observed by the upcoming CMB-S4 or Simons Observatory experiments, we find that the template fitting approach would increase the cluster lensing signal-to-noise by a factor of 1.4.","Sanjaykumar Patil, Srinivasan Raghunathan, Christian L.

135,"In this paper, we present an analysis of the pulsating behaviour of $Kepler$ target KIC 10284901. The Fourier transform of the high-precision light curve reveals 7 independent frequencies for its light variations. Among them, the first two frequencies are main pulsation modes: F0 = 18.994054(1) $\rm{d^{-1}}$ and F1 = 24.335804(4) $\rm{d^{-1}}$, the ratio of F0/F1 = 0.7805 classify this star as a double-mode high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) star; another two frequencies $f_{m1}$ = 0.4407 d$^{-1}$ and $f_{m2}$ = 0.8125 d$^{-1}$ are detected directly, and the modulations of $f_{m1}$ and $f_{m2}$ to F0 and F1 modes (seen as quintuplet structures centred on these two modes in the frequency spectrum) are also found. This is the first detection of a double-modulation effect in the HADS stars. The features of the frequency pattern and the ratio ($f_{m1}$/$f_{m2}$ $\approx$ 1:2) as well as the cyclic variation of amplitude of the two dominate pulsation modes, which seem to be similar to that in Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, indicate this modulation might be related to the Blazhko effect.

136,"We critically examine the methodology behind the claimed observational detection of halo assembly bias using optically selected galaxy clusters by Miyatake et al. (2016) and More et al. (2016). We mimic the optical cluster detection algorithm and apply it to two different mock catalogs generated from the Millennium simulation galaxy catalog, one in which halo assembly bias signal is present, while the other in which the assembly bias signal has been expressly erased. We split each of these cluster samples into two using the average cluster-centric distance of the member galaxies to measure the difference in the clustering strength of the subsamples with respect to each other. We observe that the subsamples split by cluster-centric radii show differences in clustering strength, even in the catalog where the true assembly bias signal was erased. We show that this is a result of contamination of the member galaxy sample from interlopers along the line-of-sight. This undoubtedly shows that the particular methodology adopted in the previous studies cannot be used to claim a detection of the assembly bias signal. We figure out the tell-tale signatures of such contamination, and show that the observational data also shows similar signatures. Furthermore, we also show that projection effects in optical galaxy clusters can bias the inference of the 3-dimensional edges of galaxy clusters (splashback radius), so appropriate care should be taken while interpreting the splashback radius of optical clusters.","Tomomi Sunayama, Surhud More","13 pages, 11 figures",1905.07557v2,No journal ref found,Surhud More,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07557v2,2019-05-18 08:57:06+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,On the measurements of assembly bias and splashback radius using   optically selected galaxy clusters,2019-05-22 02:32:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07557v2
137,"Protostellar flares are rapid magnetic energy release events associated with formation of hot plasma in protostars. In the previous models of protostellar flares, the interaction between a protostellar magnetosphere with the surrounding disk plays crucial roles in building-up and releasing the magnetic energy. However, it remains unclear if protostars indeed have magnetospheres because vigorous disk accretion and strong disk magnetic fields in the protostellar phase may destroy the magnetosphere. Considering this possibility, we investigate the energy accumulation and release processes in the absence of a magnetosphere using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation. Our simulation reveals that protostellar flares are repeatedly produced even in such a case. Unlike in the magnetospheric models, the protostar accumulates magnetic energy by acquiring large-scale magnetic fields from the disk by accretion. Protostellar flares occur when a portion of the large-scale magnetic fields are removed from the protostar as a result of magnetic reconnection. Protostellar flares in the simulation are consistent with observations; the released magnetic energy (up to $\sim 3\times 10^{38}$ erg) is large enough to drive observed flares, and the flares produce hot ejecta. The expelled magnetic fields enhance accretion, and the energy build-up and release processes are repeated as a result. The magnetic flux removal via reconnection leads to redistribution of magnetic fields in the inner disk. We therefore consider that protostellar flares will play an important role in the evolution of the disk magnetic fields in the vicinity of protostars.","Shinsuke Takasao, Kengo Tomida, Kazunari Iwasaki, Takeru K.

138,"Plateaus are common in X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Among a few scenarios for the origin of them, the leading one is that there exists a magnetar inside and persistently injects its spin-down energy into an afterglow. In previous studies, the radiation efficiency of this process is assumed to be a constant $\gtrsim0.1$, which is quite simple and strong. In this work we obtain the efficiency from a physical point of view and find that this efficiency strongly depends on the injected luminosity. One implication of this result is that those X-ray afterglow light curves which show steeper temporal decay than $t^{-2}$ after the plateau phase can be naturally understood now. Also, the braking indexes deduced from afterglow fitting are found to be larger than those in previous studies, which are more reasonable for newborn magnetars.","Di Xiao, Zi-Gao Dai","10 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ",1903.09349v3,No journal ref found,Zi-Gao Dai,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09349v3,2019-03-22 03:52:13+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Determining the efficiency of converting magnetar spin-down energy into   gamma-ray burst X-ray afterglow emission and its possible implications,2019-05-22 01:24:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09349v3

140,"This paper is concerned with the comparison of semi-analytical and non-averaged propagation methods for Earth satellite orbits. We analyse the total integration error for semi-analytical methods and propose a novel decomposition into dynamical, model truncation, short-periodic, and numerical error components. The first three are attributable to distinct approximations required by the method of averaging, which fundamentally limit the attainable accuracy. In contrast, numerical error, the only component present in non-averaged methods, can be significantly mitigated by employing adaptive numerical algorithms and regularized formulations of the equations of motion. We present a collection of non-averaged methods based on the integration of existing regularized formulations of the equations of motion through an adaptive solver. We implemented the collection in the orbit propagation code THALASSA, which we make publicly available, and we compared the non-averaged methods to the semi-analytical method implemented in the orbit propagation tool STELA through numerical tests involving long-term propagations (on the order of decades) of LEO, GTO, and high-altitude HEO orbits. For the test cases considered, regularized non-averaged methods were found to be up to two times slower than semi-analytical for the LEO orbit, to have comparable speed for the GTO, and to be ten times as fast for the HEO (for the same accuracy). We show for the first time that efficient implementations of non-averaged regularized formulations of the equations of motion, and especially of non-singular element methods, are attractive candidates for the long-term study of high-altitude and highly elliptical Earth satellite orbits.","Davide Amato, Claudio Bombardelli, Giulio BaÃ¹, Vincent Morand, Aaron J.

141,"Recently, spiral wave patterns (SWPs) have been detected in 3 minute oscillations of sunspot umbrae, but the nature of this phenomenon has remained elusive. We present a theoretical model that interprets the observed SWPs as the superposition of two different azimuthal modes of slow magnetoacoustic waves driven below the surface in an untwisted and non-rotating magnetic cylinder. We apply this model to SWPs of the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity in a pore observed by the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph installed at the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope. One- and two-armed SWPs were identified in instantaneous amplitudes of LOS Doppler velocity maps of 3 minute oscillations. The associated oscillation periods are about 160 s, and the durations are about 5 minutes. In our theoretical model, the observed spiral structures are explained by the superposition of non-zero azimuthal modes driven 1600 km below the photosphere in the pore. The one-armed SWP is produced by the slow-body sausage (m = 0) and kink (m = 1) modes, and the two-armed SWP is formed by the slow-body sausage (m = 0) and fluting (m = 2) modes of the magnetic flux tube forming the pore.","Juhyung Kang, Jongchul Chae, Valery M.

142,"The Cassini spacecraft's Grand Finale orbits provided a unique opportunity to probe Saturn's gravity field and interior structure. Doppler measurements yielded unexpectedly large values for the gravity harmonics J_6, J_8, and J_10 that cannot be matched with planetary interior models that assume uniform rotation. Instead we present a suite of models that assume the planet's interior rotates on cylinders, which allows us to match all the observed even gravity harmonics. For every interior model, the gravity field is calculated self-consistently with high precision using the Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method. We present an acceleration technique for this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost, allows us to efficiently optimize model parameters, map out allowed parameter regions with Monte Carlo sampling, and increases the precision of the calculated J_2n gravity harmonics to match the error bars of the observations, which would be difficult without acceleration. Based on our models, Saturn is predicted to have a dense central core of 15-18 Earth masses and an additional 1.5-5 Earth masses of heavy elements in the envelope. Finally, we vary the rotation period in the planet's deep interior and determine the resulting oblateness, which we compare with the value from radio occultation measurements by the Voyager spacecraft. We predict a rotation period of 10:33:34 h +- 55s, which is in agreement with recent estimates derived from ring seismology.","B. Militzer, S. Wahl, W. B.

143,"Wide-field Halpha images of the radio faint Galactic supernova remnant G182.4+4.2 reveal a surprisingly extensive and complex emission structure, with an unusual series of broad and diffuse filaments along the remnant's southwestern limb. Deep [O III] 5007 images reveal no appreciable remnant emission with the exception of a single filament coincident with the westernmost of the broad southwest filaments. The near total absence of [O III] emission suggests the majority of the remnant's optical emission arises from relatively slow shocks (<70 km/s), consistent with little or no associated X-ray emission. Low-dispersion optical spectra of several regions in the remnant's main emission structure confirm a lack of appreciable [O III] emission and indicate [S II]/Halpha line ratios of 0.73 - 1.03, consistent with a shock-heated origin. We find G182.4+4.2 to be a relatively large (d~50 pc at 4 kpc) and much older (age ~40 kyr) supernova remnant than previously estimated, whose weak radio and X-ray emissions are related to its age, low shock velocity, and location in a low density region some 12 kpc out from the Galactic centre.","Robert Fesen, Jack Neustadt, Thomas How, Christine Black","9 pages, 5 figures; accepted to MNRAS",1905.08901v1,No journal ref found,Christine Black,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08901v1,2019-05-21 23:43:05+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Detection of Extensive Optical Emission from the Extremely Radio Faint   Galactic Supernova Remnant G182.4+4.3,2019-05-21 23:43:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08901v1
144,"In 1977, while Apple II and Atari computers were being sold, a tiny dot was observed in an inconvenient orbit. The minor body 1977 UB, to be named (2060) Chiron, with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus, became the first Centaur, a new class of minor bodies orbiting roughly between Jupiter and Neptune. The observed overabundance of short-period comets lead to the downfall of the Oort Cloud as exclusive source of comets and to the rise of the need for a Trans-Neptunian comet belt. Centaurs were rapidly seen as the transition phase between Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), also known as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and the Jupiter-Family Comets (JFCs). Since then, a lot more has been discovered about Centaurs: they can have cometary activity and outbursts, satellites, and even rings. Over the past four decades since the discovery of the first Centaur, rotation periods, surface colors, reflectivity spectra and albedos have been measured and analyzed. However, despite such a large number of studies and complementary techniques, the Centaur population remains a mystery as they are in so many ways different from the TNOs and even more so from the JFCs.","Nuno Peixinho, Audrey Thirouin, Stephen C.

145,"We present GRAMSES, a new pipeline for nonlinear cosmological $N$-body simulations in General Relativity (GR). This code adopts the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism of GR, with constant mean curvature and minimum distortion gauge fixings, which provides a fully nonlinear and background independent framework for relativistic cosmology. Employing the fully constrained formulation, the Einstein equation is reduced to a set of ten elliptical equations solved using multigrid relaxation on adaptive mesh refinements (AMR), and three hyperbolic equations for the evolution of dynamical degrees of freedom. The current version of GRAMSES neglects the evolution equations for the gravitational sector by using the conformal flatness approximation, which allows it to compute the two scalar and two vector degrees of freedom, while extensions to include these evolution equations are ongoing. In this paper we describe the methodology, implementation, code tests and first results for cosmological simulations in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, while the generation of initial conditions and physical results will be discussed elsewhere. Inheriting the efficient AMR and massive parallelisation infrastructure from the publicly-available $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulation code RAMSES, GRAMSES is ideal for studying the detailed behaviour of spacetime inside virialised cosmic structures and hence accurately quantifying the impact of backreaction effects on the cosmic expansion, as well as for investigating GR effects on cosmological observables using cosmic-volume simulations.","Cristian Barrera-Hinojosa, Baojiu Li","34 pages, 8 figures",1905.08890v1,No journal ref found,Baojiu Li,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08890v1,2019-05-21 22:35:19+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,GRAMSES: a new route to general relativistic $N$-body simulations in   cosmology - I.

146,"Upcoming observations from the Simons Observatory have been projected to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, at the level of $\sigma(r)=$0.003. Here we describe one of the forecasting algorithms for the Simons Observatory in more detail, based on cleaning CMB polarization maps using a parametric model. We present a new code to perform this end-to-end forecast, and explore the assumptions in greater detail. If spatial uniformity of the spectral energy distribution of synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission is assumed over the region planned for observations, covering almost a fifth of the sky, a bias of order 1--3$\sigma$ in $r$ is projected for foreground models consistent with current data. We find that by masking the most contaminated regions of sky, or by adopting more parameters to describe the spatial variation in spectral index for synchrotron and dust, such a bias can be mitigated for the foreground models we consider. We also explore strategies for testing whether the cleaned CMB polarization maps contain residual foreground contamination, including cross-correlating with maps tracing the foregrounds. This method also has applications for other CMB polarization experiments.","Ben Thorne, Jo Dunkley, David Alonso, Maximilian H. Abitbol, Josquin Errard, J.

147,"On hot Jupiter exoplanets, strong horizontal and vertical winds should homogenize the abundances of the important absorbers CH$_4$ and CO much faster than chemical reactions restore chemical equilibrium. This effect, typically neglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested as explanation for discrepancies between observed infrared lightcurves and those predicted by GCMs: On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict outgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m band. We modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O by assuming that the CH$_4$/CO ratio is constant throughout the simulation domain. We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with 8 CH$_4$/CO ratios. In the more likely CO-dominated regime, we find temperature changes $\geq$50-100 K compared to the equilibrium chemistry case across large regions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and should thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures between 600K and 1300K. We find that spectra in regions with strong methane absorption, including the Spitzer 3.6 and 8 $\mu$m bands, are strongly impacted by disequilibrium abundances. We expect chemical quenching to result in much larger nightside fluxes in the 3.6 $\mu$m band, in stark contrast to observations. Meanwhile, we find almost no effect on predicted observations in the 4.5 $\mu$m band, as the opacity changes due to CO and H$_2$O offset each other. We thus conclude that disequilibrium carbon chemistry cannot explain the observed low nightside fluxes in the 4.5 $\mu$m band.","Maria E Steinrueck, Vivien Parmentier, Adam P Showman, Joshua D Lothringer, Roxana E Lupu","28 pages, 12 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ.

148,"Based on a newly proposed mirror-matter model of neutron-mirror neutron ($n-n'$) oscillations, the puzzles related to ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are explained. In particular, the phenomena around the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff for UHECRs can be well understood under the new mirror matter model. The suppression factor of the GZK effect due to the opacity of cosmic microwave background is calculated and agrees with the observations well. Most of the super-GZK events (i.e., above the GZK cutoff), as predicted in the new model, come from mirror matter sources that are invisible to electromagnetic telescopes and can penetrate the mirror cosmic microwave background at much further distances. Most remarkably, the anti-correlation between super-GZK and sub-GZK events in the hotspot observed by the Telescope Array (TA) collaboration can be naturally understood in this model. The possible correlations between the UHECRs from the TA hotspot and other nearby powerful sources such as high energy neutrinos detected by IceCube, the largest black hole merger (GW170729) observed by LIGO, and the hottest star-forming supercluster Lynx Arc, are discussed as well under the new theory.",Wanpeng Tan,"arXiv:1902.01837 for neutron lifetime and dark matter,

149,"GRB 190114C is the first gamma-ray burst detected at Very High Energies (VHE, i.e. >300 GeV) by the MAGIC Cherenkov telescope. The analysis of the emission detected by the Fermi satellite at lower energies, in the 10 keV -- 100 GeV energy range, up to ~ 50 seconds (i.e. before the MAGIC detection) can hold valuable information. We analyze the spectral evolution of the emission of GRB 190114C as detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in the 10 keV -- 40 MeV energy range up to ~60 sec. The first 4 s of the burst feature a typical prompt emission spectrum, which can be fit by a smoothly broken power-law function with typical parameters. Starting on ~4 s post-trigger, we find an additional nonthermal component, which can be fit by a power law. This component rises and decays quickly. The 10 keV -- 40 MeV flux of the power-law component peaks at ~ 6 s; it reaches a value of 1.7e-5 erg cm-2 s-1. The time of the peak coincides with the emission peak detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi. The power-law spectral slope that we find in the GBM data is remarkably similar to that of the LAT spectrum, and the GBM+LAT spectral energy distribution seems to be consistent with a single component. This suggests that the LAT emission and the power-law component that we find in the GBM data belong to the same emission component, which we interpret as due to the afterglow of the burst. The onset time allows us to estimate the initial jet bulk Lorentz factor Gamma_0 is about 500, depending on the assumed circum-burst density.","M. E. Ravasio, G. Oganesyan, O. S. Salafia, G.

We find that the transit light curve is well fit with a planet-only model, with a best-fit $\chi^2_\nu$ equal to 1.01. The addition of a moon does not significantly improve the fit quality. We compare our results directly with the original light curve from Teachey & Kipping (2018), and find that we obtain a better fit to the data using a model with fewer free parameters (no moon). We discuss possible sources for the discrepancy in our results, and conclude that the lunar transit signal found by Teachey & Kipping (2018) was likely an artifact of the data reduction. This finding highlights the need to develop independent pipelines to confirm results that push the limits of measurement precision.","Laura Kreidberg, Rodrigo Luger, Megan Bedell","7 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJL",1904.10618v2,No journal ref found,Megan Bedell,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10618v2,2019-04-24 02:48:53+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,No Evidence for Lunar Transit in New Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope   Observations of the Kepler-1625 System,2019-05-21 20:59:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10618v2

In this paper, we test the assumption of isotropy from the two-point angular correlation function of 2440 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) of the FERMI GRB catalogue. We show that the uncertainties in the GRB positions may induce spurious anisotropic signals in their sky distribution. However, when such uncertainties are taken into account no significant evidence against the large-scale statistical isotropy is found.

152,"Due to the small amount of hydrogen (${\leq 0.1M_{\odot}}$) remaining on the surface of their progenitors, Type IIb supernovae are sensitive probes of the mass loss processes of massive stars towards the ends of their lives, including the role of binarity. We report late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2011dh in M51, and a brief period of re-brightening and plateau in the photometric light curve, from $1.8$ to $6.2$ years after the explosion. These observations exclude the role of circumstellar interaction, however a slow rotating magnetar, a significant quantity of radioactive elements or a light echo could be responsible for the late-time luminosity observed at $t > 1000\mathrm{d}$. If the late-time light curve is powered by the decay of radioactive elements, SN~2011dh is required to have produced $\sim 2.6 \times 10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}$ of $\mathrm{^{44}Ti}$, which is significantly in excess of the amount inferred from earlier nebular spectra of SN 2011dh itself or measured in the Cas A SN remnant. The evolution of the brightness and the colour of the late-time light curve also supports the role of a light echo originating from dust with a preferred geometry of a disk of extent $\sim 1.8$ to $\sim 2.7\,\mathrm{pc}$ from the SN, consistent with a wind-blown bubble. Accounting for the long term photometric evolution due to a light echo, the flux contribution from a surviving binary companion at ultraviolet wavelengths can be isolated and corresponds to a star of $\sim 9 - 10M_{\odot}$.",Justyn R.

153,"The physical origin of diffuse Ly$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) around star-forming galaxies is still a matter of debate. We present the dependence of LAH luminosity ($L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$) on the stellar mass ($M_\star$), $SFR$, color excess ($E(B-V)_\star$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm h}$) of the parent galaxy for $\sim 900$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\sim2$ divided into ten subsamples. We calculate $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ using the stacked observational relation between $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ and central Ly$\alpha$ luminosity by Momose et al. (2016), which we find agrees with the average trend of VLT/MUSE-detected individual LAEs. We find that our LAEs have relatively high $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ despite low $M_\star$ and $M_{\rm h}$, and that $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ remains almost unchanged with $M_\star$ and perhaps with $M_{\rm h}$. These results are incompatible with the cold stream (cooling radiation) scenario and the satellite-galaxy star-formation scenario, because the former predicts fainter $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ and both predict steeper $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ vs. $M_\star$ slopes. We argue that LAHs are mainly caused by Ly$\alpha$ photons escaping from the main body and then scattered in the circum-galactic medium. This argument is supported by LAH observations of H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs). When LAHs are taken into account, the Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions of our LAEs are about ten times higher than those of HAEs with similar $M_\star$ or $E(B-V)_\star$, which may partly arise from lower HI gas masses implied from lower $M_{\rm h}$ at fixed $M_\star$, or from another Ly$\alpha$ source in the central part.","Haruka Kusakabe, Kazuhiro Shimasaku, Rieko Momose, Masami Ouchi, Kimihiko Nakajima, Takuya Hashimoto, Yuichi Harikane, John D.

154,"The world astronomical image archives represent huge opportunities to time-domain astronomy sciences and other hot topics such as space defense, and astronomical observatories should improve this wealth and make it more accessible in the big data era. In 2010 we introduced the Mega-Archive database and the Mega-Precovery server for data mining images containing Solar system bodies, with focus on near Earth asteroids (NEAs). This paper presents the improvements and introduces some new related data mining tools developed during the last five years. Currently, the Mega-Archive has indexed 15 million images available from six major collections (CADC, ESO, ING, LCOGT, NVO and SMOKA) and other instrument archives and surveys. This meta-data index collection is daily updated (since 2014) by a crawler which performs automated query of five major collections. Since 2016, these data mining tools run to the new dedicated EURONEAR server, and the database migrated to SQL engine which supports robust and fast queries. To constrain the area to search moving or fixed objects in images taken by large mosaic cameras, we built the graphical tools FindCCD and FindCCD for Fixed Objects which overlay the targets across one of seven mosaic cameras (Subaru-SuprimeCam, VST-OmegaCam, INT-WFC, VISTA-VIRCAM, CFHT-MegaCam, Blanco-DECam and Subaru-HSC), also plotting the uncertainty ellipse for poorly observed NEAs. In 2017 we improved Mega-Precovery, which offers now two options for calculus of the ephemerides and three options for the input (objects defined by designation, orbit or observations). Additionally, we developed Mega-Archive for Fixed Objects (MASFO) and Mega-Archive Search for Double Stars (MASDS).

155,"Stars passing too close to a black hole can produce tidal disruption events (TDEs), when the tidal force across the star exceeds the gravitational force that binds it. TDEs have usually been discussed in relation to massive black holes that reside in the centres of galaxies or lurk in star clusters. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that triple stars hosting a stellar black hole (SBH) may be sources of TDEs. We start from a triple system made up of three main sequence (MS) stars and model the supernova (SN) kick event that led to the production of an inner binary comprised of a SBH. We evolve these triples in isolation with a high precision $N$-body code and study their TDEs as a result of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We explore a variety of distributions of natal kicks imparted during the SN event, various maximum initial separations for the triples, and different distributions of eccentricities. We show that the main parameter that governs the properties of the SBH-MS binaries which produce a TDE in triples is the mean velocity of the natal kick distribution. Smaller $\sigma$'s lead to larger inner and outer semi-major axes of the systems that undergo a TDE, smaller SBH masses, and longer timescales. We find that the fraction of systems that produce a TDE is roughly independent of the initial conditions, while estimate a TDE rate of $7.3\times 10^{-5}-4.1 \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, depending on the prescriptions adopted for the SBH natal kicks. This rate is almost comparable to the expected TDE rate for massive black holes.","Giacomo Fragione, Nathan Leigh, Rosalba Perna, Bence Kocsis","10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with

By solving the exact equations of motion, including the dissipative effects and the mutual gravitational perturbations, we investigate the configuration of the system soon after the guiding satellite is disrupted when crossing the Roche limit with the central planet during its orbital decay. The application is done for the system composed of Saturn and the two small co-orbital satellites Janus and Epimetheus. We perform a large number of numerical simulations, varying the mass of the hypothetical guiding satellite, Saturn's tidal quality factor and the initial configuration and the masses of the small satellites.

157,"Recently, high-precision optical 2~min cadence light curves obtained with \emph{TESS} for targets located in the mission's defined first four sectors have been released. The majority of these high-cadence and high-precision measurements currently span $\sim28\,{\rm d}$, thereby allowing periodic variability occurring on timescales $\lesssim14\,{\rm d}$ to potentially be detected. Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) A-type stars are well known to exhibit rotationally modulated photometric variability that is produced by inhomogeneous chemical abundance distributions in their atmospheres. While mCP stars typically exhibit rotation periods that are significantly longer than those of non-mCP stars, both populations exhibit typical periods $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$; therefore, the early \emph{TESS} releases are suitable for searching for rotational modulation of the light curves of both mCP and non-mCP stars. We present the results of our search for A-type stars that exhibit variability in their \emph{TESS} light curves that is consistent with rotational modulation based on the first two data releases obtained from sectors 1 to 4. Our search yielded $134$ high-probability candidate rotational variables -- $60$ of which have not been previously reported. Approximately half of these stars are identified in the literature as Ap (mCP) stars. Comparisons between the subsample of high-probability candidate rotationally variable Ap stars and the subsample of stars that are not identified as Ap reveal that the latter subsample exhibits statistically (i) shorter rotation periods and (ii) significantly lower photometric amplitudes.","J.

158,"The question of whether galaxy mergers are linked to the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN) continues to be a topic of considerable debate. The issue can be broken down into two distinct questions: 1) Can galaxy mergers trigger AGN? 2) Are galaxy mergers the dominant AGN triggering mechanism? A complete picture of the AGN-merger connection requires that both of these questions are addressed with the same dataset. In previous work, we have shown that galaxy mergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) show an excess of both optically-selected, and mid-IR colour-selected AGN, demonstrating that the answer to the first of the above questions is affirmative. Here, we use the same optical and mid-IR AGN selection to address the second question, by quantifying the frequency of morphological disturbances in low surface brightness r-band images from the Canada France Imaging Survey (CFIS). Only ~30 per cent of optical AGN host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating that recent interactions are not the dominant trigger. However, almost 60 per cent of mid-IR AGN hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that interactions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding. Both mid-IR and optically selected AGN have interacting fractions that are a factor of two greater than a mass and redshift matched non-AGN control sample, an excess that increases with both AGN luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass.","Sara L.

159,"Here we present the first open-source radiative transfer model for computing the reflected light of exoplanets at any phase geometry, called PICASO: Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations. This code, written in Python, has heritage from a decades old, well-known Fortran model used for several studies of planetary objects within the Solar System and beyond. We have adopted it to include several methodologies for computing both direct and diffuse scattering phase functions, and have added several updates including the ability to compute Raman scattering spectral features. Here we benchmark PICASO against two independent codes and discuss the degree to which the model is sensitive to a user's specification for various phase functions. Then, we conduct a full information content study of the model across a wide parameter space in temperature, cloud profile, SNR and resolving power.","Natasha E. Batalha, Mark S. Marley, Nikole K.

160,"After 30 Doradus, N11 is the second largest and brightest nebula in the LMC. This large nebula has several OB associations with bright nebulae at its surroundings. N11 was previously mapped at the lowest rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO (J=1--0 and 2--1), and in some particular regions pointings of the $^{13}$CO J=1--0 and 2--1 lines were also performed. Using ASTE we mapped the whole extension of the N11 nebula in the $^{12}$CO J=3--2 line, and three sub-regions in the $^{13}$CO J=3--2 line. The regions mapped in the $^{13}$CO J=3--2 were selected based on that they may be exposed to the radiation at different ways: a region lying over the nebula related to the OB association LH10 (N11B), another one that it is associated with the southern part of the nebula related to the OB association LH13 (N11D), and finally a farther area at the southwest without any embedded OB association (N11I). We found that the morphology of the molecular clouds lying in each region shows some signatures that could be explained by the expansion of the nebulae and the action of the radiation. Fragmentation generated in a molecular shell due to the expansion of the N11 nebula is suggested. The integrated line ratios $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO show evidences of selective photodissociation of the $^{13}$CO, and probably other mechanisms such as chemical fractionation. The CO contribution to the continuum at 870 $\mu$m was directly derived. The distribution of the integrated line ratios $^{12}$CO J=3--2/2--1 show hints of stellar feedback in N11B and N11D. The ratio between the virial and LTE mass (M$_{\rm vir}$/M$_{\rm LTE}$) is higher than unity in all analyzed molecular clumps, which suggests that the clumps are not gravitationally bounded and may be supported by external pressure. A non-LTE analysis suggests that we are mapping gas with densities about a few 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$.","M. Celis PeÃ±a, S. Paron, M. Rubio, C. N. Herrera, M. E. Ortega",Accepted to be published in A&A.

161,"The equation of motion in the generally covariant modified gravity (MOG) theory leads, for weak gravitational fields and non-relativistic motion, to a modification of Newton's gravitational acceleration law. In addition to the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, MOG has a vector field $\phi_\mu$ that couples with gravitational strength to all baryonic matter. The gravitational coupling strength is determined by the MOG parameter $\alpha$, while parameter $\mu$ is the small effective mass of $\phi_\mu$. The MOG acceleration law has been demonstrated to fit a wide range of galaxies, galaxy clusters and the Bullet Cluster and Train Wreck Cluster mergers. For the SPARC sample of rotationally supported spiral and irregular galaxies, McGaugh et al. [24] (MLS) have found a radial acceleration relation (RAR) that relates accelerations derived from galaxy rotation curves to Newtonian accelerations derived from galaxy mass models. Using the same SPARC galaxy data, mass models independently derived from that data, and MOG parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu$ that run with galaxy mass, we demonstrate that adjusting galaxy parameters within $\pm 1$-sigma bounds can yield MOG predictions consistent with the given rotational velocity data. Moreover, the same adjusted parameters yield a good fit to the RAR of MLS, with the RAR parameter $a_0=(5.4\pm .3)\times 10^{-11}\,{\rm m/s^2}$.","M. A. Green, J. W.

162,"The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) stands for the mean surface brightness of the sky as we would see it from a representative vantage point in the intergalactic space outside of our Milky Way Galaxy. Averaged over the whole 4 pi solid angle it represents the collective light from all luminous matter radiated throughout the cosmic history. Part of the EBL is resolved into galaxies that, with the increasing detecting power of giant telescopes and sensitive detectors, are seen to deeper and deeper limiting magnitudes. This resolved part is now known to contribute a substantial or even the major part of the EBL. There still remains, however, the challenge of finding out to what extent galaxies too faint or too diffuse to be discerned individually, individual stars or emission by gas outside the galaxies, or more speculatively, some hitherto unknown light sources such as decaying elementary particles are accounting for the remaining EBL. We review the recent progress that has been made in the measurement of EBL. The current photometric results suggest that there is, beyond the resolved galaxies, an EBL component that cannot be explained by diffuse galaxy halos or intergalactic stars.","Kalevi Mattila, Petri VÃ¤isÃ¤nen","Accepted manuscript of a review article for Contemporary Physics, 31

163,"Using the newly commissioned KCWI instrument on the Keck-II telescope, we analyse the stellar kinematics and stellar populations of the well-studied massive early-type galaxy (ETG) NGC 1407. We obtained high signal-to-noise integral-field-spectra for a central and an outer (around one effective radius towards the south-east direction) pointing with integration times of just 600s and 2400s, respectively. We confirm the presence of a kinematically distinct core also revealed by VLT/MUSE data of the central regions. While NGC 1407 was previously found to have stellar populations characteristic of massive ETGs (with radially constant old ages and high alpha-enhancements), it was claimed to show peculiar super-solar metallicity peaks at large radius that deviated from an otherwise strong negative metallicity gradient, which is hard to reconcile within a `two-phase' formation scenario. Our outer pointing confirms the near-uniform old ages and the presence of a steep metallicity gradient, but with no evidence for anomalously high metallicity values at large galactocentric radii. We find a rising outer velocity dispersion profile and high values of the 4th-order kinematic moment -- an indicator of possible anisotropy. This coincides with the reported transition from a bottom-heavy to a Salpeter initial mass function, which may indicate that we are probing the transition region from the `in-situ' to the accreted phase. With short exposures, we have been able to derive robust stellar kinematics and stellar populations in NGC 1407 to about 1 effective radius. This experiment shows that future work with KCWI will enable 2D kinematics and stellar populations to be probed within the low surface brightness regions of galaxy halos in an effective way.","Anna Ferre-Mateu, Duncan A.

164,"We report on Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) X-ray Telescope (XRT) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) observations of IGR J16493-4348, a wind-fed Supergiant X-ray Binary (SGXB) showing significant superorbital variability. From a discrete Fourier transform of the BAT light curve, we refine its superorbital period to be 20.058 $\pm$ 0.007 days. The BAT dynamic power spectrum and a fractional root mean square analysis both show strong variations in the amplitude of the superorbital modulation, but no observed changes in the period were found. The superorbital modulation is significantly weaker between MJD 55,700 and MJD 56,300. The joint NuSTAR and XRT observations, which were performed near the minimum and maximum of one cycle of the 20 day superorbital modulation, show that the flux increases by more than a factor of two between superorbital minimum and maximum. We find no significant changes in the 3-50 keV pulse profiles between superorbital minimum and maximum, which suggests a similar accretion regime. Modeling the pulse-phase averaged spectra we find a possible Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV at superorbital maximum. The feature is not significant at superorbital minimum. While we do not observe any significant differences between the pulse-phase averaged spectral continua apart from the overall flux change, we find that the hardness ratio near the broad main peak of the pulse profile increases from superorbital minimum to maximum. This suggests the spectral shape hardens with increasing luminosity. We discuss different mechanisms that might drive the observed superorbital modulation.","Joel B. Coley, Robin H. D.

165,"ALMA 870$\mu$m continuum imaging has uncovered a population of blends of multiple dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in sources originally detected with the Herschel Space Observatory. However, their pairwise separations are much smaller that what is found by ALMA follow-up of other single-dish surveys or expected from theoretical simulations. Using ALMA and VLA, we have targeted three of these systems to confirm whether the multiple 870$\mu$m continuum sources lie at the same redshift, successfully detecting $^{12}$CO($J = 3$-2) and $^{12}$CO($J = 1$-0) lines and being able to confirm that in the three cases all the multiple DSFGs are likely physically associated within the same structure. Therefore, we report the discovery of two new gas-rich dusty protocluster cores (HELAISS02, $z = 2.171 \pm 0.004$; HXMM20, $z = 2.602 \pm 0.002$). The third target is located in the well known COSMOS overdensity at $z = 2.51$ (named CL J1001+0220 in the literature), for which we do not find any new secure CO(1-0) detection, although some of its members show only tentative detections and require further confirmation. From the gas, dust, and stellar properties of the two new protocluster cores, we find very large molecular gas fractions yet low stellar masses, pushing the sources above the main sequence, while not enhancing their star formation efficiency. We suggest that the sources might be newly formed galaxies migrating to the main sequence.

Current gravitational waveform templates are only valid for small orbital velocities (i.e., in a post-Newtonian expansion) and small initial eccentricity $e_0$ (""post-circular"" expansion). We conventionally define $e_0$ as the eccentricity corresponding to an orbital frequency of $5 \text{ mHz}$, and we study the convergence properties of frequency-domain inspiral templates that are accurate up to 2PN and order $e_0^6$ in eccentricity. We compute the so-called ""unfaithfulness"" between the full template and ""reduced"" templates obtained by dropping some terms in the phasing series; we investigate the conditions under which systematic errors are negligible with respect to statistical errors, and we study the convergence properties of statistical errors. In general, eccentric waveforms lead to larger statistical errors than circular waveforms due to correlations between the parameters, but the error estimates do not change significantly as long as we include terms of order $e_0^2$ or higher in the phasing.","Sashwat Tanay, Antoine Klein, Emanuele Berti, Atsushi Nishizawa","13 pages, 4 figures",1905.08811v1,No journal ref found,Atsushi Nishizawa,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08811v1,2019-05-21 18:00:03+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE,Convergence of Fourier-domain templates for inspiraling eccentric   compact binaries,2019-05-21 18:00:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08811v1

We detect strong line emission at $1.621\pm0.002\,\mu$m with a line flux of ($2.63\pm0.52$)$\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We tentatively identify this line as [C$\,$III] $\lambda$1907, but we are unable to detect C$\,$III] $\lambda$1909 owing to sky emission at the expected location.

These results favor models that produce higher ionization, such as the BPASS models for the photospheres of high-mass stars, and that include both binary stellar populations and/or an IMF that extends to 300 M$_{\odot}$. The combined C$\,$III] equivalent width and [3.6]$-$[4.5] color are more consistent with ionization from young stars than AGN, however we cannot rule out ionization from a combination of an AGN and young stars.

168,"Recent investigations of the double red clump in the color-magnitude diagram of the Milky Way bulge cast serious doubts on the structure and formation origin of the outer bulge. Unlike previous interpretation based on an X-shaped bulge, stellar evolution models and CN-band observations have suggested that this feature is another manifestation of the multiple stellar population phenomenon observed in globular clusters (GCs). This new scenario requires a significant fraction of the outer bulge stars with chemical patterns uniquely observed in GCs. Here we show from homogeneous high-quality spectroscopic data that the red giant branch stars in the outer bulge (> 5.5 degrees from the Galactic center) are clearly divided into two groups according to Na abundance in the [Na/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane. The Na-rich stars are also enhanced in Al, while the differences in O and Mg are not observed between the two Na groups. The population ratio and the Na and Al differences between the two groups are also comparable with those observed in metal-rich GCs. The only plausible explanation for these chemical patterns and characteristics appears to be that the outer bulge was mostly assembled from disrupted proto-GCs in the early history of the Milky Way.","Young-Wook Lee, Jenny J.

We show how the relative strength between number-changing and number-conserving interactions together with the dark plasma lifetime affect the thermal fate of the various composite models. Additionally, we discover that the final dark relic density of composite particles can be diluted due to an entropy increase stemming from dark plasma decay.

170,"We introduce the Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs -- SMUGGLE model, an explicit and comprehensive stellar feedback model for the moving-mesh code Arepo. This novel sub-resolution model resolves the multiphase gas structure of the interstellar medium and self-consistently generates gaseous outflows. The model implements crucial aspects of stellar feedback including photoionization, radiation pressure, energy and momentum injection from stellar winds and from supernovae. We explore this model in high-resolution isolated simulations of Milky Way-like disc galaxies. Stellar feedback regulates star formation to the observed level and naturally captures the establishment of a Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. This result is achieved independent of the numerical mass and spatial resolution of the simulations. Gaseous outflows are generated with average mass loading factors of the order of unity. Strong outflow activity is correlated with peaks in the star formation history of the galaxy with evidence that most of the ejected gas eventually rains down onto the disc in a galactic fountain flow that sustains late-time star formation. Finally, the interstellar gas in the galaxy shows a distinct multiphase distribution with a coexistence of cold, warm and hot phases.","Federico Marinacci, Laura V.

172,"The collection of planetary system properties derived from large surveys such as Kepler provides critical constraints on planet formation and evolution. These constraints can only be applied to planet formation models, however, if the observational biases and selection effects are properly accounted for. Here we show how epos, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, can be used to constrain planet formation models by comparing the Bern planet population synthesis models to the Kepler exoplanetary systems. We compile a series of diagnostics, based on occurrence rates of different classes of planets and the architectures of multi-planet systems, that can be used as benchmarks for future and current modeling efforts. Based on these diagnostics we identify physical properties and processes that would result in the Bern model more closely matching the known planetary systems. These are: moving the planet trap at the inner disk edge outward; increasing the formation efficiency of mini-Neptunes; reducing the fraction of stars that form observable planets; and increasing the relative importance of dynamical stirring with respect to orbital damping by gas. We conclude with an outlook on the composition of planets in the habitable zone, and highlight that the majority of simulated planets smaller than 1.7 Earth radii have substantial hydrogen atmospheres.

173,"The twin Higgs mechanism is a solution to the little hierarchy problem in which the top partner is neutral under the Standard Model (SM) gauge group. The simplest mirror twin Higgs (MTH) model -- where a $\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry copies each SM particle -- has too many relativistic degrees of freedom to be consistent with cosmological observations. We demonstrate that MTH models can have an observationally viable cosmology if the twin mass spectrum leads to twin neutrino decoupling before the SM and twin QCD phase transitions. Our solution requires the twin photon to have a mass of $\sim 20$ MeV and kinetically mix with the SM photon to mediate entropy transfer from the twin sector to the SM. This twin photon can be robustly discovered or excluded by future experiments. Additionally, the residual twin degrees of freedom present in the early Universe in this scenario would be detectable by future observations of the cosmic microwave background.","Keisuke Harigaya, Robert McGehee, Hitoshi Murayama, Katelin Schutz","7+4 pages, 4 figures",1905.08798v1,No journal ref found,Katelin Schutz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08798v1,2019-05-21 18:00:00+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-ex,A Predictive Mirror Twin Higgs with Small $\mathbf{Z}_2$ Breaking,2019-05-21 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08798v1
174,"We use the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulations to explore the galaxy-halo connection as inferred from state-of-the-art cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulations. With the high mass resolution and large volume achieved by combining the 100 Mpc (TNG100) and 300 Mpc (TNG300) volumes, we establish the mean occupancy of central and satellite galaxies and their dependence on the properties of the dark matter haloes hosting them. We derive best-fitting HOD parameters from TNG100 and TNG300 for target galaxy number densities of $\bar{n}_g = 0.032\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ and $\bar{n}_g = 0.016\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$, respectively, corresponding to a minimum galaxy stellar mass of $M_\star\sim1.9\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $M_\star\sim3.5\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively, in hosts more massive than $10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Consistent with previous work, we find that haloes located in dense environments, with low concentrations, later formation times, and high angular momenta are richest in their satellite population. At low mass, highly-concentrated haloes and those located in overdense regions are more likely to contain a central galaxy. The degree of environmental dependence is sensitive to the definition adopted for the physical boundary of the host halo. We examine the extent to which correlations between galaxy occupancy and halo properties are independent and demonstrate that HODs predicted by halo mass and present-day concentration capture the qualitative dependence on the remaining halo properties. At fixed halo mass, concentration is a strong predictor of the stellar mass of the central galaxy, which may play a defining role in the fate of the satellite population. The radial distribution of satellite galaxies, which exhibits a universal form across a wide range of host halo mass, is described accurately by the best-fit NFW density profile of their host haloes.","Sownak Bose, Daniel J.

175,"Galaxies and galaxy groups located along the line of sight towards gravitationally lensed quasars produce high-order perturbations of the gravitational potential at the lens position. When these perturbation are too large, they can induce a systematic error on $H_0$ of a few-percent if the lens system is used for cosmological inference and the perturbers are not explicitly accounted for in the lens model. In this work, we present a detailed characterization of the environment of the lens system WFI2033-4723 ($z_{\rm src} = 1.662$, $z_{\rm lens}$ = 0.6575), one of the core targets of the H0LICOW project for which we present cosmological inferences in a companion paper (Rusu et al. 2019). We use the Gemini and ESO-Very Large telescopes to measure the spectroscopic redshifts of the brightest galaxies towards the lens, and use the ESO-MUSE integral field spectrograph to measure the velocity-dispersion of the lens ($\sigma_{\rm {los}}= 250^{+15}_{-21}$ km/s) and of several nearby galaxies. In addition, we measure photometric redshifts and stellar masses of all galaxies down to $i < 23$ mag, mainly based on Dark Energy Survey imaging (DR1). Our new catalog, complemented with literature data, more than doubles the number of known galaxy spectroscopic redshifts in the direct vicinity of the lens, expanding to 116 (64) the number of spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin (2 arcmin) from the lens. Using the flexion-shift as a measure of the amplitude of the gravitational perturbation, we identify 2 galaxy groups and 3 galaxies that require specific attention in the lens models. The ESO MUSE data enable us to measure the velocity-dispersions of three of these galaxies. These results are essential for the cosmological inference analysis presented in Rusu et al. (2019).","D.

176,"The obscuring structure surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be explained as a dust and gas flow cycle that fundamentally connects the AGN with their host galaxies. Although this structure is usually associated with dusty winds driven by radiation pressure, almost all models for the accretion onto a supermassive blackhole and outflows invoke magnetic fields, which are poorly understood. We have detected the polarization of the torus of NGC 1068 using ALMA Cycle 4 high-angular resolution ($0.07$"", $4.2$ pc) polarimetric dust continuum observations at Band 7 (348.5 GHz, $860$ $\mu$m). We measure an asymmetric variation of the degree of polarization across the torus equatorial axis with a peak polarization of $2.2\pm0.3$% and position angle of $9\pm2^{\circ}$ (E-vector) at $\sim8$ pc east from the core. We compute synthetic polarimetric observations of magnetically aligned dust grains assuming a toroidal magnetic field and homogeneous grain alignment. We conclude that the measured 860 $\mu$m continuum polarization arises from magnetically aligned dust grains in an optically thin region of the torus within the central 16 pc region. We explain the asymmetric degree of polarization across the equatorial axis of the torus due to 1) an inhomogeneous optical depth, and 2) a variation of the velocity dispersion, i.e. variation of the magnetic field turbulence at sub-pc scales, from the eastern to the western part of the torus. These observations constrain the torus properties beyond spectral energy distribution results. Our data and modeling lend strong support for the presence of magnetic fields up to a few pc that can contribute to the support of the torus.","Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez, Almudena Alonso-Herrero, Santiago GarcÃ­a-Burillo, Michael S.

177,"Orbital properties of stars, computed from their six-dimensional phase space measurements and an assumed Galactic potential, are used to understand the structure and evolution of the Galaxy. Stellar actions, computed from orbits, have the attractive quality of being invariant under certain assumptions and are therefore used as quantitative labels of a star's orbit. We report a subtle but important systematic error that is induced in the actions as a consequence of local midplane variations expected for the Milky Way. This error is difficult to model because it is non-Gaussian and bimodal, with neither mode peaking on the null value. An offset in the vertical position of the Galactic midplane of $\sim15\,\text{pc}$ for a thin disk-like orbit or $\sim 120\,\text{pc}$ for a thick disk-like orbit induces a $25\%$ systematic error in the vertical action $J_z$. In FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, these variations are on the order of $\sim100\,\text{pc}$ at the solar circle. From observations of the mean vertical velocity variation of $\sim5\text{--}10\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ with radius, we estimate that the Milky Way midplane variations are $\sim60\text{--}170\,\text{pc}$, consistent with three-dimensional dust maps. Action calculations and orbit integrations, which assume the global and local midplanes are identical, are likely to include this induced error, depending on the volume considered. Variation in the local standard of rest or distance to the Galactic center causes similar issues. The variation of the midplane must be taken into account when performing dynamical analysis across the large regions of the disk accessible to Gaia and future missions.","Angus Beane, Robyn E.

178,"Presolar grains originating in oxygen-neon novae may be identified by their sulfur isotopic ratios compared with theoretical estimates. These ratios depend on reliable $^{33}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{34}$Cl and $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl reaction rates. The latter rate has recently been computed based on experimental input, and many new excited states in $^{35}$Cl were discovered above the proton threshold. The experimental $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl rate was found to be 2 - 5 times smaller than the theoretical one, and the simulated $^{34}$S/$^{32}$S isotopic ratio for nova presolar grains was thus predicted to be smaller than that of type II supernova grains by up to a factor of 3.7. The present study was performed to confirm the existence of these new resonances, and to improve the remaining uncertainties in the $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl reaction rate. Energies and spin-parities of the $^{35}$Cl excited levels were investigated with an Enge split-pole spectrograph using the $^{32}$S($\alpha, p$)$^{35}$Cl reaction. Differential cross sections of the outgoing protons were measured at $E_{\alpha}$ = 21 MeV. The existence of the newly discovered states are largely confirmed, although a few states were not observed in this study. The spins and parities of several $^{35}$Cl states were assigned tentatively for the first time. The present $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl experimental thermonuclear reaction rate is consistent within 1$\sigma$ with the previous evaluation. However, our rate uncertainty is larger due to a more realistic treatment of the experimental uncertainties. The uncertainty in the present rate is up to a factor of 3.5 at nova temperatures. We recommend future work to focus on the unknown properties of four excited states of $^{35}$Cl at 6643 keV, 6761 keV, 6780 keV, and 6800 keV.","Kiana Setoodehnia, John H.

179,"Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observed a 1 s long gamma-ray signal (GW150914-GBM) starting 0.4 s after the first gravitational wave detection from the binary black hole merger GW150914. GW150914-GBM is consistent with a short gamma-ray burst origin; however, no unambiguous claims can be made as to the physical association of the two signals due to a combination of low gamma-ray flux and unfavorable location for Fermi-GBM. Here we answer the following question: if GW150914 and GW150914-GBM were associated, how many LIGO-Virgo binary black hole mergers would Fermi-GBM have to follow up to detect a second source? To answer this question, we perform simulated observations of binary black hole mergers with LIGO- Virgo and adopt different scenarios for gamma-ray emission from the literature. We calculate the ratio of simulated binary black hole mergers detected by LIGO-Virgo to the number of gamma-ray counterpart detections by Fermi-GBM, BBH-to-GRB ratio. A large majority of the models considered here predict a BBH-to-GRB ratio in the range of 5 to 20, but for optimistic cases can be as low as 2 or for pessimistic assumptions as high as 700. Hence we expect that the third observing run, with its high rate of binary black hole detections and assuming the absence of a joint detection, will provide strong constraints on the presented models.","P.

180,"The topology of the coronal magnetic field produces a strong impact on the properties of the solar corona and presumably on the origin of the slow solar wind. To advance our understanding of this impact, we revisit the concept of so-called slip-back mapping (Titov et al. 2009) and adapt it for determining open, closed, and disconnected flux systems that are formed in the solar corona by magnetic reconnection during a given time interval. The developed method allows us, in particular, to describe the magnetic flux transfer between open and closed flux regions via so-called interchange reconnection with unprecedented level of details. We illustrate the application of this method to the analysis of a global MHD evolution of the solar corona that is driven by an idealized differential rotation of the photospheric plasma.","R.

181,"The capacity of Stage IV lensing surveys to measure the neutrino mass sum and differentiate between the normal and inverted mass hierarchies depends on the impact of nuisance parameters describing small-scale baryonic astrophysics and intrinsic alignments. For a Euclid-like survey, we perform the first combined weak lensing and galaxy clustering Fisher analysis with baryons, intrinsic alignments, and massive neutrinos for both hierarchies. We use a matter power spectrum generated from a halo model that captures the impact of baryonic feedback and adiabatic contraction. For weak lensing, we find that baryons cause severe degradation to forecasts of the neutrino mass sum, $\Sigma$, approximately doubling $\sigma_{\Sigma}$. We show that including galaxy clustering constraints from Euclid and BOSS, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) Planck priors, can reduce this degradation to $\sigma_{\Sigma}$ to 9% and 16% for the normal and inverted hierarchies respectively. The combined forecasts, $\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{NH}}}=0.034\, \rm{eV}$ and $\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{IH}}}=0.034\, \rm{eV}$, preclude a meaningful distinction of the hierarchies but could be improved upon with future CMB priors on $n_s$ and information from neutrinoless double beta decay to achieve a 2$\sigma$ distinction. The effect of intrinsic alignments on forecasts is shown to be minimal, with $\sigma_{\Sigma}$ even experiencing mild improvements due to information from the intrinsic alignment signal. We find that while adiabatic contraction and intrinsic alignments will require careful calibration to prevent significant biasing of $\Sigma$, there is less risk presented by feedback from energetic events like AGN and supernovae.","David Copeland, Andy Taylor, Alex Hall","23 pages, 13 figures.

In order to take into account the non-perturbative effects, at tree level we use the massive Yang-Mills theory which has successfully described the lattice results of the gluon and ghost propagators in the Landau gauge. We couple quarks to this theory and compute the one-loop polarization effects. The presence of the gluon mass significantly tempers the medium effects and uncertainties associated with the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The diquark condensate in two-color QCD is color-singlet, for which neither electric nor magnetic screening masses should appear at the scale less than the diquark gap. The presence of the gap helps to explain the lattice results which are not very sensitive to the quark density. Meanwhile, we also found the limitation of the one-loop estimate as well as the lack of some physics in perturbative medium corrections.","Daiki Suenaga, Toru Kojo","17 pages, 11 figures",1905.08751v1,No journal ref found,Toru Kojo,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08751v1,2019-05-21 17:01:19+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE|hep-lat|nucl-th,Gluon propagator in two-color dense QCD: Massive Yang-Mills approach at   one-loop,2019-05-21 17:01:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08751v1
183,"Prior to the detection of black holes (BHs) via the gravitational waves (GWs) they generate at merger, the presence of BHs was inferred in X-ray binaries, mostly via dynamical measurements, with masses in the range between $\sim 5-20~M_\odot$. The LIGO discovery of the first BHs via GWs was surprising in that the two BHs that merged had masses of $35.6^{+4.8}_{-3.0}$ and $30.6^{+3.0}_{-4.4}\,M_\odot$, which are both above the range inferred from X-ray binaries. With 20 BH detections from the O1/O2 runs, the distribution of masses remains generally higher than the X-ray inferred one, while the effective spins are generally lower, suggesting that, at least in part, the GW-detected population might be of dynamical origin rather than produced by the common evolution of field binaries. Here we perform high-resolution N-body simulations of a cluster of isolated BHs with a range of initial mass spectra and upper mass cut-offs, and study the resulting binary mass spectrum resulting from the dynamical interactions. Our clusters have properties similar to those of the massive remnants in an OB association $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. We perform a likelihood analysis for each of our dynamically-formed binary population against the data from the O1 and O2 LIGO/Virgo runs. We find that an initial mass spectrum $M_{\rm BH}\propto M^{-2.35}$ with an upper mass cutoff $M_{\rm max}\sim 50M_\odot$ is favored by the data, together with a slight preference for a merger rate that increases with redshift.","Rosalba Perna, Yi-Han Wang, Will M.

187,"By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study whether the proton-to-electron mass ratio $m_i/m_e$ influences the energy spectrum and underlying acceleration mechanism during magnetic reconnection. While kinetic simulations are essential for studying particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection, a reduced $m_i/m_e$ is often used to alleviate the demanding computing resources, which leads to artificial scale separation between electron and proton scales. Recent kinetic simulations with high-mass-ratio have suggested new regimes of reconnection, as electron pressure anisotropy develops in the exhaust region and supports extended current layers. In this work, we study whether different $m_i/m_e$ changes the particle acceleration processes by performing a series of simulations with different mass ratio ($m_i/m_e=25-400$) and guide-field strength in a low-$\beta$ plasma. We find that mass ratio does not strongly influence reconnection rate, magnetic energy conversion, ion internal energy gain, plasma energization processes, ion energy spectra, and the acceleration mechanisms for high-energy ions. Simulations with different mass ratios are different in electron acceleration processes, including electron internal energy gain, electron energy spectrum and the acceleration efficiencies for high-energy electrons. We find that high-energy electron acceleration becomes less efficient when the mass ratio gets larger because the \textit{Fermi}-like mechanism associated with particle curvature drift becomes less efficient. These results indicate that when particle curvature drift dominates high-energy particle acceleration, the further the particle kinetic scales are from the magnetic field curvature scales ($\sim d_i$), the weaker the acceleration will be.","Xiaocan Li, Fan Guo, Hui Li","28 pages, 10 figures, accepted to ApJ",1905.08797v1,No journal ref found,Hui Li,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08797v1,2019-05-21 15:49:21+00:00,physics.plasm-ph,physics.plasm-ph|astro-ph.SR|physics.space-ph,Particle acceleration in kinetic simulations of non-relativistic   magnetic reconnection with different ion-electron mass ratio,2019-05-21 15:49:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08797v1
188,"Recent radio surveys have discovered a large number of low luminosity core dominated radio galaxies that are much more abundant than those at higher luminosities. These objects will be too faint in gamma-rays to be detected individually by Fermi. Nevertheless, they may contribute significantly to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background. We consider here the possible contribution of these core dominated radio galaxies to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background. Using published data available for all 45 of the radiogalaxies listed as detected counterparts in the Fermi FL8Y source list update to the 3FGL catalog, we have searched for radio maps which can resolve the core flux from the total source flux. Using high resolution radio maps we were able to obtain core fluxes for virtually every source. We then derived a relation between core radio flux and gamma-ray flux that we extrapolated to sources with low radio luminosities that are known to be highly core dominated. We then employed a very recent determination of the luminosity function for core dominated radio galaxies in order to obtain the contribution of all possible gamma-ray emitting radio galaxies to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find this contribution to be a possibly non-negligible, 4% - 18% of the background.","Floyd W. Stecker, Chris R. Shrader, Matthew. A.

189,"Observations indicate that nearly all galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers. When galaxies merge, their component black holes form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs), which emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) that can be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We have searched the recently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits. As we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\% upper limits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency and sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the GW strain of $h_0 < 7.3(3) \times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a technique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar using ``dropout' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals in measurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper limits on the GW strain to place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs. At the most-sensitive sky location, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with $f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz within 120 Mpc for $\mathcal{M} = 10^9 \, M_\odot$, and within 5.5 Gpc for $\mathcal{M} = 10^{10} \, M_\odot$. We also determined that there are no SMBHBs with $\mathcal{M} > 1.6 \times 10^9 \, M_\odot$ emitting GWs in the Virgo Cluster. Finally, we estimated the number of potentially detectable sources given our current strain upper limits based on galaxies in Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and merger rates from the Illustris cosmological simulation project. Only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the local Universe contained a detectable source, from which we concluded it was unsurprising that we did not detect any individual sources given our current sensitivity to GWs.","K.

190,"Providing accurate predictions for the spatial distribution of matter and luminous tracers in the presence of massive neutrinos is an important task, given the imminent arrival of highly accurate large-scale structure observations. In this work, we address this challenge by extending cosmology-rescaling algorithms to massive neutrino cosmologies. In this way, a $\Lambda$CDM simulation can be modified to provide nonlinear structure formation predictions in the presence a hot component of arbitrary mass, and, if desired, to include non-gravitational modifications to the clustering of matter on large scales. We test the accuracy of the method by comparing its predictions to a suite of simulations carried out explicitly including a neutrino component in its evolution equations. We find that, for neutrino masses in the range $M_\nu \in [0.06, 0.2] ~ \mathrm{eV}$ the matter power spectrum is recovered to better than $1\%$ on all scales $k<1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and at $2\%$ level at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $M_\nu = 0.3 ~ \mathrm{eV}$. Similarly, the halo mass function is predicted at a few percent level over the range $M_{\rm halo} \in [10^{12}, 10^{15}] ~ h^{-1} ~ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and so do also the multipoles of the galaxy 2-point correlation function in redshift space over $r \in [0.1, 200] ~ h^{-1} ~ \mathrm{Mpc}$. We provide parametric forms for the necessary transformations, as a function of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\Omega_{\nu}$ for various target redshifts.","Matteo Zennaro, RaÃºl E.

194,"The origin and nature of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are still unknown. However, great progress has been achieved in past years due to the observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. Above $10^{18}$ eV the observed energy spectrum presents two features: a hardening of the slope at about $10^{18.7}$ eV, which is known as the ankle and a suppression at approximately $10^{19.6}$ eV. The composition inferred from the experimental data, interpreted by using the current high energy hadronic interaction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend to heavier nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy. Current high energy hadronic interaction models, updated by using Large Hadron Collider data, are still subject to large systematic uncertainties, which makes difficult the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of composition. On the other hand, it is very well known that gamma rays and neutrinos are produced by UHECRs during propagation from their sources, as a consequence of their interactions with the radiation field present in the universe. The flux at Earth of these secondary particles depends on the source models of UHECRs including the chemical composition at injection. Therefore, both gamma-ray and neutrino observations can be used to constrain source models of UHECRs, including the composition in a way which is independent of the high energy hadronic interaction models.

195,"The Photon Transfer Curve (PTC) of a CCD depicts the variance of uniform images as a function of their average. It is now well established that the variance is not proportional to the average, as Poisson statistics would indicate, but rather flattens out at high flux. This `variance deficit', related to the brighter-fatter effect, feeds correlations between nearby pixels, that increase with flux, and decay with distance. We propose an analytical expression for the PTC shape, and for the dependence of correlations with intensity, and relate both to some more basic quantities related to the electrostatics of the sensor, that are commonly used to correct science images for the brighter-fatter effect. We derive electrostatic constraints from a large set of flat field images acquired with a CCD e2v 250, and eventually question the generally-admitted assumption that boundaries of CCD pixels shift by amounts proportional to the source charges.","Pierre Astier, Pierre Antilogus, Claire Juramy, RÃ©my Le Breton, Laurent Le Guillou, Eduardo Sepulveda, The Dark Energy Science Collaboration",16 pages.

196,"It has recently been proposed that the accreting collapsed object GRO J1655--40 could contain a non-zero gravitomagnetic monopole, and hence could be better described with the more general Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime, instead of the Kerr spacetime. This makes the KTN spacetime astrophysically relevant. In this paper, we study properties of various circular orbits in the KTN spacetime, and find the locations of circular photon orbits (CPOs) and innermost-stable-circular-orbits (ISCOs). Such orbits are important to interpret the observed X-ray spectral and timing properties of accreting collapsed objects, viz., black holes and naked singularities. Here we show that the usual methods to find the ISCO radius do not work for certain cases in the KTN spacetime, and we propose alternate ways. For example, the ISCO equation does not give any positive real radius solution for particular combinations of Kerr and NUT parameter values for KTN naked singularities. In such a case, accretion efficiency generally reaches $100\%$ at a particular orbit of radius $r=r_0$, and hence we choose $r=r_0$ as the `ISCO' for practical purposes.","Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya","24 pages, revised version, published in JCAP",1901.04233v2,No journal ref found,Sudip Bhattacharyya,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04233v2,2019-01-14 10:59:11+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|gr-qc|hep-th,Circular orbits in Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime and their implications for   accreting black holes and naked singularities,2019-05-21 14:37:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04233v2
197,"The morphology of spectral line polarization is the most valuable observable to investigate the magnetic and dynamic solar atmosphere. However, in order to develop solar diagnosis, it is fundamental to understand the different kinds of anomalous solar signals that have been routinely found in linear and circular polarization (LP,CP). The goal of this paper has been to explain and characterize the morphology of solar CP signals by understanding the combined effect of magnetic fields, velocity gradients, and atomic orientation in general NLTE regime. To that aim, an analytical two-layer model of the polarized radiative transfer equation is developed and used to solve the NLTE problem with atomic polarization in a semi-parametric way. The formation of polarization is thus insightfully described with certain precision without neither resorting in MHD models nor sacrifying key physical ingredients. The potential of the model for reproducing solar anomalous CP is shown with detailed calculations. The essential physical behavior of dichroism and atomic orientation is described, introducing the concepts of dichroic inversion, neutral and reinforcing medium, critic intensity spectrum, and critic source function. It is shown that the zero-crossings of the CP spectrum are useful to classify its morphology and understand its formation. This led to identify and explain the morphology of the seven most characteristics CP signals that a single (depth-resolved) scattering layer can produce. Futhermore, it is found that a minimal number of two magnetic layers along the LOS is required to fully explain anomalous solar CP signals, and that the morphology and polarity of Stokes V depends on magnetic, radiative and atomic polarities. Some implications of these results are presented through a preliminar modeling of anomalous CP signals in the Na I D and Fe I 1564.8 nm lines.",Edgar S. Carlin,"18 pages, 18 figures.

199,"Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. In the hadronic scenario the TeV gamma-ray emission from SNRs originates from decaying pions that are produced in collisions of the interstellar gas and CRs. Using CR-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we show that magnetic obliquity-dependent shock acceleration is able to reproduce the observed TeV gamma-ray morphology of SNRs such as Vela Jr.\ and SN1006 solely by varying the magnetic morphology. This implies that gamma-ray bright regions result from quasi-parallel shocks (i.e., when the shock propagates at a narrow angle to the upstream magnetic field), which are known to efficiently accelerate CR protons, and that gamma-ray dark regions point to quasi-perpendicular shock configurations. Comparison of the simulated gamma-ray morphology to observations allows us to constrain the magnetic coherence scale $\lambda_B$ around Vela Jr.\ and SN1006 to $\lambda_B \simeq 10_{-3.3}^{+10}$~pc and $\lambda_B >200_{-10}^{+80}$~pc, respectively, where the ambient magnetic field of SN1006 is consistent with being largely homogeneous.

201,"At the low temperatures ($\sim$10 K) and high densities ($\sim$100,000 H$_2$ molecules per cc) of molecular cloud cores and protostellar envelopes, a large amount of molecular species (in particular those containing C and O) freeze-out onto dust grain surfaces. It is in these regions that the deuteration of H$_3^+$ becomes very efficient, with a sharp abundance increase of H$_2$D$^+$ and D$_2$H$^+$. The multi-deuterated forms of H$_3^+$ participate in an active chemistry: (i) their collision with neutral species produces deuterated molecules such as the commonly observed N$_2$D$^+$, DCO$^+$ and multi-deuterated NH$_3$; (ii) their dissociative electronic recombination increases the D/H atomic ratio by several orders of magnitude above the D cosmic abundance, thus allowing deuteration of molecules (e.g. CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O) on the surface of dust grains. Deuterated molecules are the main diagnostic tools of dense and cold interstellar clouds, where the first steps toward star and protoplanetary disk formation take place. Recent observations of deuterated molecules are reviewed and discussed in view of astrochemical models inclusive of spin-state chemistry. We present a new comparison between models based on complete scrambling (to calculate branching ratio tables for reactions between chemical species that include protons and/or deuterons) and models based on non-scrambling (proton hop) methods, showing that the latter best agree with observations of NH$_3$ deuterated isotopologues and their different nuclear spin symmetry states.","Paola Caselli, Olli SipilÃ¤, Jorma Harju","accepted for publication in the Philosophical Transactions A of the

202,"As of today ten circumbinary planets orbiting solar type main sequence stars have been discovered. Nearly all of them orbit around the central binary very closely to the region of instability where it is difficult to form them in situ. It is assumed that they formed further out and migrated to their observed position. We extend previous studies to a more realistic thermal disc structure and determine what parameter influence the final parking location of a planet around a binary star. We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of viscous accretion discs around a central binary that include viscous heating and radiative cooling from the disc surfaces. We vary the binary eccentricity as well as disc viscosity and mass. Concerning the disc evolution we find that it can take well over 100000 binary orbits until an equilibrium state is reached. As seen previously, we find that the central cavity opened by the binary becomes eccentric and precesses slowly in a prograde sense. Embedded planets migrate to the inner edge of the disc. In cases of lower disc viscosity they migrate further in maintaining a circular orbit, while for high viscosity they are parked further out on an eccentric orbit. The final location of an embedded planet is linked to its ability to open a gap in the disc. Gap opening planets separate inner from outer disc, preventing eccentricity excitation in the latter and making it more circular. This allows embedded planets to migrate closer to the binary, in agreement with the observations. The necessary condition for gap opening and the final planet position depend on the planet mass and disc viscosity.","Wilhelm Kley, Daniel Thun, Anna B. T.

203,"Formic acid (HCOOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are simple species that have been detected in the interstellar medium. The solid-state formation pathways of these species under experimental conditions relevant to prestellar cores are primarily based off of weak infrared transitions of the HOCO complex and usually pertain to the H2O-rich ice phase, and therefore more experimental data are desired. In this article, we present a new and additional solid-state reaction pathway that can form HCOOH and CO2 ice at 10 K 'non-energetically' in the laboratory under conditions related to the ""heavy"" CO freeze-out stage in dense interstellar clouds, i.e., by the hydrogenation of an H2CO:O2 ice mixture. This pathway is used to piece together the HCOOH and CO2 formation routes when H2CO or CO reacts with H and OH radicals. Temperature programmed desorption - quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to confirm the formation and pathways of newly synthesized ice species as well as to provide information on relative molecular abundances. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) is additionally employed to characterize reaction products and determine relative molecular abundances. We find that for the conditions investigated in conjunction with theoretical results from the literature, H+HOCO and HCO+OH lead to the formation of HCOOH ice in our experiments. Which reaction is more dominant can be determined if the H+HOCO branching ratio is more constrained by computational simulations, as the HCOOH:CO2 abundance ratio is experimentally measured to be around 1.8:1. H+HOCO is more likely than OH+CO (without HOCO formation) to form CO2. Isotope experiments presented here further validate that H+HOCO is the dominant route for HCOOH ice formation in a CO-rich CO:O2 ice mixture that is hydrogenated. These data will help in the search and positive identification of HCOOH ice in prestellar cores.","D. Qasim, T. Lamberts, J. He, K. -J. Chuang, G. Fedoseev, S. Ioppolo, A. C. A. Boogert, H.

We used the astrometric information of a sample of 31 OB stars from the star-forming W3 Complex to identify another 37 W3 members and to derive its distance from their Gaia-DR2 parallaxes with improved accuracy. The Gaia-DR2 distance to the W3 Complex,2.14$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kpc, coincides with the previous stellar distances of $\sim$ 2 kpc. The Gaia-DR2 parallaxes tentatively show differential distances for different parts of the W3 Complex: W3 Main, located to the NE direction, is at 2.30$^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ kpc, the W3 Cluster (IC 1795), in the central region of the complex, is at 2.17$^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ kpc, and W3(OH) is at 2.00$^{+0.29}_{-0.23}$ kpc to the SW direction. The W3 Cluster is the oldest region, indicating that it triggered the formation of the other two star-forming regions located at the edges of an expanding shell around the cluster.","Felipe Navarete, Phillip A.

205,"We present a new Chandra observation (performed in July 2016) of the neutron star X-ray transient IGR J17480-2446, located in the globular cluster Terzan 5. We study the continued cooling of the neutron star crust in this system that was heated during the 2010 outburst of the source. This new observation was performed two years after the last observation of IGR J17480-2446, hence, significantly extending the cooling baseline. We reanalysed all available Chandra observations of the source (but excluding observations during which one of the known transients in Terzan 5 was in outburst) and fitted the obtained cooling curve with our cooling code NSCool, which allows for much improved modelling than what was previously performed for the source. The data and our fit models indicate that the crust was still cooling ~5.5 years after the outburst ended. The neutron star crust has likely not reached crust-core thermal equilibrium yet, and further cooling is predicted (which can be confirmed with additional Chandra observations in >5 years). Intriguingly, we find indications that the thermal conductivity might be relatively low in part of the crust compared to what has been inferred for other crust-cooling sources and tentatively suggest that this layer might be located around the neutron drip. The reason for this difference is unclear, but might be related to the fact that IGR J17480-2446 harbours a relatively slowly rotating neutron star (with a spin of 11 Hz) that has a relatively strong inferred surface magnetic field ($10^{9-10}$ Gauss) compared to what is known or typically assumed for other cooling sources.","L.

206,"Context: The ISM is on all scales full of structures that may be considered as tracers of processes that feed turbulence. Aims: We use HI survey data to derive global properties of the angular power distribution of the local ISM. Methods: HI4PI observations on an nside = 1024 HEALPix grid and Gaussian components representing three phases, the cold, warm and unstable lukewarm medium (CNM, WNM and LNM), are used for velocities $|v_{\mathrm{LSR}}| \leq 25$ \kms. For high latitudes $|b| > 20\deg$ we generate apodized maps. After beam deconvolution we fit angular power spectra. Results: Power spectra for observed column densities are exceptionally well defined and straight in log-log presentation with 3D power law indices $\gamma \geq -3$ for the local gas. For intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs) we derive $\gamma = -2.6$ and for high velocity clouds (HVCs) $\gamma = -2.0$. Single phase power distributions for the CNM, LNM, and WNM are highly correlated and shallow with $ \gamma \sim -2.5$ for multipoles $l \leq 100$. Excess power from cold filamentary structures is observed at larger multipoles. The steepest single channel power spectra for the CNM are found at velocities with large CNM and low WNM phase fractions. Conclusions: The phase space distribution in the local ISM is configured by phase transitions and needs to be described with three distinct different phases, being highly correlated but having distributions with different properties. Phase transitions cause locally hierarchical structures in phase space. The CNM is structured on small scales and is restricted in position-velocity space. The LNM as an interface to the WNM envelops the CNM. It extends to larger scales than CNM and occupies also a larger range in velocity. Correlations between the phases are self similar in velocity.","P. M. W. Kalberla, U. Haud","23 pages, 33 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",1905.08583v1,No journal ref found,U.

207,"In this paper, we discuss the temperature distribution and evolution of a microflare, simultaneously observed by Hinode XRT, EIS, and SDO AIA. We find using EIS lines that during peak emission the distribution is nearly isothermal and peaked around 4.5 MK. This temperature is in good agreement with that obtained from the XRT filter ratio, validating the use of XRT to study these small events, invisible by full-Sun X-ray monitors such as GOES. The increase in the estimated Fe XVIII emission in the AIA 94 {\AA} band can mostly be explained with the small temperature increase from the background temperatures. The presence of Fe XVIII emission does not guarantee that temperatures of 7 MK are reached, as is often assumed. We also revisit with new atomic data the temperatures measured by a SoHO SUMER observation of an active region which produced microflares, also finding low temperatures (3 - 4 MK) from an Fe XVIII / Ca XIV ratio.","Urmila Mitra-Kraev, Giulio Del Zanna","12-13 pages, 17 figures (22 eps-files), 4 tables, accepted by

209,"We aim to derive the geometric albedo of a near-Earth asteroid, (4179) Toutatis, to investigate the surface physical conditions. The asteroid has been studied rigorously not only via ground-based photometric, spectrometric, polarimetric, and radar observations but also via \textit{in situ} observation by the Chinese Chang'e 2; however, the geometric albedo is less well understood. We conducted V-band photometric observations when the asteroid was at opposition in April 2018 using three continental telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere that compose the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). The observed time-variable cross section was corrected using the radar shape model. We find that Toutatis has geometric albedo $ p_\mathrm{V} = 0.185^{+0.045}_{-0.039} $, which is typical of S-type asteroids. We compare the geometric albedo with archival polarimetric data and further find that the polarimetric slope--albedo law provides a reliable estimate for the albedo of this S-type asteroid. The thermal infrared observation also produced similar results if the size of the asteroid is updated to match the results from Chang'e 2. We conjecture that the surface of Toutatis is covered with grains smaller than that of the near-Sun asteroids including (1566) Icarus and (3200) Phaethon.","Yoonsoo P.

210,"Constraints on the tension and the abundance of cosmic strings depend crucially on the rate at which they decay into particles and gravitational radiation. We study the decay of cosmic string loops in the Abelian-Higgs model by performing field theory simulations of loop formation and evolution. We find that our set of string loops emit particle radiation primarily due to kink collisions, and that their decay time due to these losses is proportional to $L^p$ with $p \approx 2$ where $L$ is the loop length. In contrast, the decay time to gravitational radiation scales in proportion to $L$, and we conclude that particle emission is the primary energy loss mechanism for loops smaller than a critical length scale, while gravitational losses dominate for larger loops.","Daiju Matsunami, Levon Pogosian, Ayush Saurabh, Tanmay Vachaspati","6 pages, 6 figures; an animation of a representative loop can be seen

211,"Multi-Higgs models equipped with global symmetries produce scalar dark matter (DM) candidates stabilized by the unbroken symmetry. It is remarkable that a conserved CP symmetry can also stabilize DM candidates, provided it is a CP symmetry of order higher than two. CP4 3HDM, the three-Higgs-doublet model with CP symmetry of order 4, is the simplest example of this kind. It contains two mass-degenerate scalar DM candidates $\varphi$ and $\bar\varphi$, each of them being a CP4 eigenstate and, therefore, its own antiparticle. A novel phenomenological feature of this model is the presence of $\varphi\varphi \leftrightarrow \bar\varphi\bar\varphi$ conversion process, which conserves CP. It offers a rare example of DM models in which self-interaction in the dark sector can significantly affect cosmological and astrophysical observables. Here, we explore the thermal evolution of these DM species in the asymmetric regime. We assume that a mechanism external to CP4 3HDM produces an initial imbalance of the densities of $\varphi$ and $\bar\varphi$. As the Universe cools down, we track the evolution of the asymmetry through different stages, and determine how the final asymmetry depends on the interplay between the conversion and annihilation $\varphi\bar\varphi \to $ SM and on the initial conditions. We begin with the analytic treatment of Boltzmann equations, present a detailed qualitative description of the process, and then corroborate it with numerical results obtained using a dedicated computer code. Finally, we check if the model can produce an observable indirect detection signal.","Igor P.

212,"Accretion on length-scales of interstellar or even intergalactic is particularly relevant, in the context of spherical or quasi-spherical hot mode accretion, supposedly powering low excitation radio galaxies in the maintenance-mode feedback paradigm. In the present study, we aim to analyze such a spherical-type flow around the host active nucleus in the backdrop of a five-component galactic system (SMBH, stellar, dark matter, diffuse hot gas, $\Lambda$), with the principal intent to address the issue of {\it galactic potential induced shock} formation in the flow, that may contain (dissipative) isothermal standing shocks. The present paper is an extension of Raychaudhuri et al. (2018), who conducted a preliminary investigation of such a problem. The galactic potential, not only renders the flow to be multi-transonic in nature, the flow topology resembles `$X\alpha$' and `$\alpha X$' type trajectories of advective flows in the vicinity of the BHs/compact objects. Quite remarkably, owing to the influence of the galactic potential, the entire range of galactic mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon_B$) allows shock formation in central to the outer radial regions of our wind-type flows, with the strength of those galactic induced shocks found to be comparable to that of the shocks one would expect in the advective flows in the vicinity of a BH. We also observe that the shock parameters remain sensitive to $\Upsilon_B$. We discussed the possible implication of these shocks in the context of radio source dynamics as well as their potential association with flaring in radio jets. Our study also reveals that galactic potential can substantially augment the mass inflow rate.","Sananda Raychaudhuri, Shubhrangshu Ghosh, Partha S.

214,"Preparing for the expected wealth of Gaia detections, we consider here a simple algorithm for classifying unresolved astrometric binaries with main-sequence (MS) primary into three classes: binaries with a probable MS secondary, with two possible values for the mass ratio; probable hierarchical triple MS systems with an astrometric secondary as a close binary, with a limited range of mass-ratio values; and binaries with a compact-object secondary, with a minimal value of the mass ratio. This is done by defining a unit-less observational parameter 'Astrometric Mass-Ratio Function' (AMRF), $\mathcal{A}$, of a binary, based on primary-mass estimation, in addition to the astrometric parameters - the angular semi-major axis, the period and the parallax. We derive the $\mathcal{A}$ value that differentiates the three classes by forward modeling representative binaries of each class, assuming some mass-luminosity relation.To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm, we consider the orbits of 98 Hipparcos astrometric binaries with main-sequence primaries, using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the primary-mass estimates. For systems with known spectroscopic orbital solution, our results are consistent with the spectroscopic elements, validating the suggested approach. The algorithm will be able to identify hierarchical triple systems and dormant neutron-star and black-hole companions in the Gaia astrometric binaries.","Sahar Shahaf, Tsevi Mazeh, Simchon Faigler, Berry Holl",Submitted to MNRAS,1905.08542v1,No journal ref found,Berry Holl,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08542v1,2019-05-21 10:59:17+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.IM,Triage of Astrometric Binaries - how to find triple systems and dormant   black-hole secondaries in the Gaia orbits,2019-05-21 10:59:17+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08542v1
215,"The high-magnification microlensing event MACHO-97-BLG-28 was previously determined to be a binary system composed either of two M dwarfs, or an M dwarf and a brown dwarf. We present a revised light-curve model using additional data from the Mt. Stromlo 74"" telescope and more recent models of stellar limb darkening. We find a lensing system with a larger mass ratio, $q = 0.28 \pm 0.01$, and smaller projected separation, $s = 0.61 \pm 0.01 $, than that presented in the original study. We revise the estimate of the lens-source relative proper motion to $\mu_{rel}=2.8 \pm 0.5 \; \mathrm{mas\: yr^{-1}}$, which indicates that 16.07 years after the event maximum the lens and source should have separated by $46 \pm 8 \;mas$. We revise the source star radius using more recent reddening maps and angular diameter-color relations to $R_*=(10.3 \pm 1.9) R_\odot$. K and J-band adaptive optics images of the field taken at this epoch using the NIRC2 imager on the Keck telescope show that the source and lens are still blended, consistent with our light-curve model. With no statistically significant excess flux detection we constrain the mass, $M_L= 0.24^{+0.28}_{-0.12}M_\odot$, and distance, $D_L = 7.0 \pm 1.0 \,kpc$, of the lensing system. This supports the interpretation of this event being a stellar binary in the galactic bulge.

The final 2MTF catalogue contains 2,062 nearby spiral galaxies in the CMB frame velocity range of 600 km s$^{-1}$ $< cz < 10,000$ km s$^{-1}$ with a mean velocity of 4,805 km s$^{-1}$. The main update in this release is the replacement of some archival HI data with newer ALFALFA data. Using the 2MTF template relation, we calculate the distances and peculiar velocities of all 2MTF galaxies. The mean uncertainties of the linear distance measurements are around 22\% in all three infrared bands. 2MTF measurements agree well with the distances from the Cosmicflows-3 compilation, which contains 1,117 common galaxies, including 28 with SNIa distance measurements. Using distances estimated from the `3-bands combined' 2MTF sample and a $\chi^2$ minimization method, we find best-fit bulk flow amplitudes of $308 \pm 26$ km s$^{-1}$, $318 \pm 29$ km s$^{-1}$, and $286 \pm 25$ km s$^{-1}$ at depths of $R_I = $ 20, 30 and 40 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, respectively, which is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and with previous 2MTF results with different estimation techniques and a preliminary catalogue.","Tao Hong, Lister Staveley-Smith, Karen L.

219,"Six gravitational wave events have been reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (LVC), five of them associated with black hole binary (BHB) mergers and one with a double neutron star (DNS) merger, while the coalescence of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary is still missing. We investigate the progenitors of double compact object binaries with our population-synthesis code MOBSE. MOBSE includes advanced prescriptions for mass loss by stellar winds (depending on metallicity and on the Eddington ratio) and a formalism for core-collapse, electron-capture and (pulsational) pair instability supernovae. We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope parameter $\alpha{}$ and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 M$_\odot$, with a preference for light NSs, while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses ($1.3-2.0$ M$_\odot$). BHs in merging BHNSs are preferentially low mass ($5-15$ M$_\odot$). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from $\sim{}5$ to $\sim{}45$ M$_\odot$. The local merger rate density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.","Nicola Giacobbo, Michela Mapelli","22 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables, published in MNRAS, We corrected a

We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions.   The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition.   The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range.   These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, TESS and PLATO.","L. Amard, A.

221,"Due to the universality of gravitational interactions, it is generally expected that a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background could form during the reheating period when the inflaton perturbatively decays with the emission of gravitons. Previously, only models in which the inflaton dominantly decays into a pair of light scalar and/or fermion particles were considered in the literature. In the present paper, we focus on the cases with a vector particle pair in the final decay product. The differential decay rates for the three-body gravitational inflaton decays are presented for two typical couplings between the inflaton and vector fields, from which we predict their respective GW frequency spectra. It turns out that, similar to the scalar and fermion cases, the obtained GW spectra is too high in frequency to be observed by the current and near-future GW detection experiments and calls for a new design of high-frequency GW detectors.","Da Huang, Lu Yin","15 pages, 4 figures",1905.08510v1,No journal ref found,Lu Yin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08510v1,2019-05-21 09:15:31+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Inflaton Decays,2019-05-21 09:15:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08510v1
222,"The luminous blue variable (LBV) RMC143 is located in the outskirts of the 30~Doradus complex, a region rich with interstellar material and hot luminous stars. We report the $3\sigma$ sub-millimetre detection of its circumstellar nebula with ALMA. The observed morphology in the sub-millimetre is different than previously observed with HST and ATCA in the optical and centimetre wavelength regimes. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of RMC143 suggests that two emission mechanisms contribute to the sub-mm emission: optically thin bremsstrahlung and dust. Both the extinction map and the SED are consistent with a dusty massive nebula with a dust mass of $0.055\pm0.018~M_{\odot}$ (assuming $\kappa_{850}=1.7\rm\,cm^{2}\,g^{-1}$). To date, RMC143 has the most dusty LBV nebula observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We have also re-examined the LBV classification of RMC143 based on VLT/X-shooter spectra obtained in 2015/16 and a review of the publication record. The radiative transfer code CMFGEN is used to derive its fundamental stellar parameters. We find an effective temperature of $\sim 8500$~K, luminosity of log$(L/L_{\odot}) = 5.32$, and a relatively high mass-loss rate of $1.0 \times 10^{-5}~M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The luminosity is much lower than previously thought, which implies that the current stellar mass of $\sim8~M_{\odot}$ is comparable to its nebular mass of $\sim 5.5~M_{\odot}$ (from an assumed gas-to-dust ratio of 100), suggesting that the star has lost a large fraction of its initial mass in past LBV eruptions or binary interactions. While the star may have been hotter in the past, it is currently not hot enough to ionize its circumstellar nebula. We propose that the nebula is ionized externally by the hot stars in the 30~Doradus star-forming region.","Claudia Agliozzo, Andrea Mehner, Neil Matthew Phillips, Paolo Leto, Jose Groh, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Carla Buemi, Francesco Cavallaro, Luciano Cerrigone, Adriano Ingallinera, Roberta Paladini, Giuliano Pignata, Corrado Trigilio, Grazia Umana","Paper accepted by A&A on 09/05/2019 and in proof stage.

223,"Observations from the radio to the gamma-ray wavelengths indicate that supernova remnant (SNR) shocks are sites of effective particle acceleration. It has been proposed that the presence of dense clumps in the environment where supernovae explode might have a strong impact in shaping the hadronic gamma-ray spectrum. Here we present a detailed numerical study about the penetration of relativistic protons into clumps which are engulfed by a SNR shock, taking into account the magneto-hydrodynamical properties of the background plasma. We show that the spectrum of protons inside clumps is much harder than that in the diffuse inter-clump medium and we discuss the implications for the formation of the spectrum of hadronic gamma rays, which does not reflect anymore the acceleration spectrum of protons, resulting substantially modified inside the clumps due to propagation effects. For the Galactic SNR RX J1713.7-3946, we show that a hadronic scenario including dense clumps inside the remnant shell is able to reproduce the broadband gamma-ray spectrum from GeV to TeV energies. Moreover, we argue that small clumps crossed by the shock could provide a natural explanation to the non-thermal X-ray variability observed in some hot spots of RX J1713.7-3946. Finally we discuss the detectability of gamma-ray emission from clumps with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array and the possible detection of the clumps themselves through molecular lines.","Silvia Celli, Giovanni Morlino, Stefano Gabici, Felix Aharonian","15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1804.10579v2,No journal ref found,Felix Aharonian,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10579v2,2018-04-27 16:24:40+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Supernova remnants in clumpy media: particle propagation and gamma-ray   emission,2019-05-21 09:00:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10579v2
224,"Gravitational wave emission can lead to the coalescence of close pairs of compact objects orbiting each other. For the case of neutron stars such mergers may yield masses above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, leading to the formation of black holes. For the case of white dwarfs the merger product may exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, leading either to a thermonuclear explosion as Type Ia supernova, or to a collapse forming a neutron star. If a Type Ia supernova explosion is avoided, the merger of two massive white dwarfs is expected to form a hydrogen- and helium-free circumstellar nebula with a hot and luminous, rapidly rotating and highly magnetized central star for several 10,000 yr before its final collapse. Here we report the discovery of a hot star with an emission line dominated spectrum in the centre of a circular mid-infrared nebula. Both the star and the nebula appear to be free of hydrogen and helium. Our tailored stellar atmosphere and wind models indicate a stellar surface temperature of about 200,000 K, and a record outflow velocity of 16,000 km/s. This extreme velocity, together with the derived mass outflow rate, imply rapid stellar rotation and a strong magnetic field aiding the wind acceleration. The Gaia distance of the star leads to a luminosity of 10^{4.5} Lsun, which matches models of the post-merger evolution of super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. The high stellar temperature and the nebular size argue for a short remaining lifetime of the star, which will produce a bright optical and high-energy transient upon collapse. Our observations indicate that super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf mergers can indeed avoid a thermonuclear explosion as Type Ia supernova, and provide empirical evidence for magnetic field generation in stellar mergers.","V.

225,"With the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) we monitored the black hole candidate X-ray binary MAXI J1535--571 over seven epochs from 21 September to 2 October 2017. Using ASKAP observations, we studied the HI absorption spectrum from gas clouds along the line-of-sight and thereby constrained the distance to the source. The maximum negative radial velocities measured from the HI absorption spectra for MAXI J1535--571 and an extragalactic source in the same field of view are $-69\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-89\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This rules out the far kinematic distance ($9.2\pm0.2$ kpc), giving a likely value of $4.0\pm0.2$ kpc, with a strong upper limit of the tangent point at $6.6$ kpc. These distance limits indicate that the peak luminosity of MAXI J1535--571 was $>75$ per cent of the Eddington luminosity, and shows that the soft-to-hard spectral state transition occurred at the very low luminosity of 1.2--3.3$\times10^{-5}$ times the Eddington luminosity. Finally, this study highlights the capabilities of new wide-field radio telescopes to probe Galactic transient outbursts, by allowing us to observe both a target source and a background comparison source in a single telescope pointing.","Jaiverdhan Chauhan, James C.

226,"Cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations have yielded several notable excesses that often lend themselves to explanation by various dark matter annihilation/decay models. In particular, the AMS-02 anti-proton and positron excesses have continued to grow more robust with the collection of more data. This is supplemented by gamma-ray excesses in the Galactic Centre and a high-energy break in spectrum of electron/positron cosmic rays seen by DAMPE. In this work we carefully model the magnetic field environments of M31 and M33 and use this to estimate expected synchrotron emissions from electrons produced via dark matter annihilation. By comparing this to available radio data we review simplifying assumptions used previously for dark matter hunting in these environments and produce novel constraints that are capable of fully ruling out dark matter models proposed to accommodate all the aforementioned excesses barring that of DAMPE. However, we do show that significant constraints can be placed upon the DAMPE parameter space with M31 data. In addition to this we project SKA non-observation constraints for the Reticulum II and Triangulum II dwarf galaxies and find these have potential to rule out cosmic-ray and gamma-ray excess-producing models of dark matter, even when the most conservative assumptions are employed.",Geoff Beck,18 pages. 10 figures. 1 table,1905.05599v3,No journal ref found,Geoff Beck,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05599v3,2019-05-09 09:53:45+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,An excess of excesses examined via dark matter radio emissions from   galaxies,2019-05-21 08:29:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05599v3

228,"In the era of big data in the radio astronomical field, image reconstruction algorithms are challenged to estimate clean images given limited computing resources and time. This article is driven by the extensive need for large scale image reconstruction for the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the largest low- and intermediate frequency radio telescope of the next decades. This work proposes a scalable wideband deconvolution algorithm called MUFFIN, which stands for `MUlti Frequency image reconstruction For radio INterferometry'. MUFFIN estimates the sky images at various frequency bands given the corresponding dirty images and point spread functions. The reconstruction is achieved by minimizing a data fidelity term and joint spatial and spectral sparse analysis regularization terms. It is consequently non-parametric w.r.t. the spectral behaviour of radio sources. MUFFIN algorithm is endowed with a parallel implementation and an automatic tuning of the regularization parameters, making it scalable and well suited for big data applications such as SKA. Comparisons between MUFFIN and the state-of-the-art wideband reconstruction algorithm are provided.","Rita Ammanouil, AndrÃ© Ferrari, David Mary, Chiara Ferrari, Francesca Loi",No comment found,1905.08468v1,No journal ref found,Francesca Loi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08468v1,2019-05-21 07:23:35+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|eess.IV,A parallel & automatically tuned algorithm for multispectral image   deconvolution,2019-05-21 07:23:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08468v1
229,"Modified theories of gravity are often built such that they contain general relativity as a limiting case. This inclusion property implies that the Kerr metric is common to many families of theories. For example, all analytic $f(R)$ theories with vanishing constant term admit the Kerr solution. In any given theory, however, the response of the gravitational field to astrophysical disturbances is tied to the structure of the field equations. As such, even if black holes are Kerr, the underlying theory can, in principle, be probed through gravitational distortions. In this paper, we study linear perturbations of a Kerr black hole in $f(R)$ gravity using the Newman-Penrose formalism. We show that, as in general relativity, the equations governing the perturbed metric, which depend on the quadratic term of the function $f$, completely decouple.",Arthur G Suvorov,8 pages.

230,"We consider an additional fine-tuning problem which afflicts scalar-driven models of inflation. The problem is that successful reheating requires the inflaton be coupled to ordinary matter, and quantum fluctuations of this matter induces Coleman-Weinberg potentials which are not Planck-suppressed. Unlike the flat space case, these potentials depend upon a still-unknown, nonlocal functional of the metric which reduces to the Hubble parameter for de Sitter. Such a potential cannot be completely subtracted off by any local action. In a simple model we numerically consider one possible subtraction scheme in which the correction is locally subtracted at the beginning of inflation. For fermions the effect is to make the universe approach de Sitter with a smaller Hubble parameter. For gauge bosons the effect is to make inflation end almost instantly unless the gauge charge is unacceptably small.","Z. H. Liao, S. P. Miao, R. P.

231,"We present combined evolution of morphological and stellar properties of galaxies on the two sides of z=2 (2.0<z<4.0 and 1.5<z<2.0) in CDFS, with ground-based spectroscopic redshifts. We perform bulge-disc decomposition on their images in J and H filters, from the 3DHST Legacy Survey obtained using HST/WFC3. Combining morphological information with stellar properties, we provide a detailed account of the formation/growth of discs and spheroids around z~2. The fraction of 2-component (bulge+disc) systems increases from ~46% for z>2 to ~70% for z<2, compensating for the fall in population of pure discs and pure spheroids. All quiescent outliers of our full sample on the main-sequence, are 2-component systems, belonging to the lower redshift range (z<2). The doubling of stellar mass of 2-component systems and decrease in their SFR by the same factor, suggests that mechanisms involved in morphological transformations are also responsible for the quenching of their star formation activity. Interestingly, while there is substantial increase in the size (~2.5 times) and mass (~5 times) of pure discs, from z>2 to z<2, pure spheroids maintain roughly the same values. Additionally, while bulge hosting discs witness an expansion in scale length (~1.3 times), their bulge sizes as well as bulge to total light ratio see no evolution, suggesting that z~2 is pre-dominantly a disc formation period.","Sonali Sachdeva, Rupjyoti Gogoi, Kanak Saha, Ajit Kembhavi, Somak Raychaudhury","15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.08432v1,No journal ref found,Somak Raychaudhury,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08432v1,2019-05-21 03:41:44+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Formation of disc galaxies around z~2,2019-05-21 03:41:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08432v1
232,"Using a sample of 208 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey in ultra-hard X-ray band ($14-195$ keV), the hot corona properties are investigated, i.e. the fraction of gravitational energy dissipated in the hot corona and the hard X-ray photon index. The bolometric luminosity, \lb, is calculated from host-corrected luminosity at 5100 \AA. Virial supermassive black hole masses (SMBH, \mbh) are calculated from the $\rm H\beta$ line width and the corresponding broad line region size-luminosity empirical relation at 5100 \AA. We find a strong anti-correlation between the fraction of energy released in corona ($F_x \equiv L_{14-195 keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$) and the Eddington ratio ($ \varepsilon \equiv L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), $F_x \propto \varepsilon^{-0.60\pm 0.1}$. It is found that this fraction also has a correlation with the SMBH mass, $F_x \propto \varepsilon^{-0.74\pm 0.14} M_{\rm BH}^{-0.30\pm 0.03}$. Assuming that magnetic buoyancy and feild reconnection lead to the formation of a hot corona, our result favours the shear stress tensor being a proportion of the gas pressure. For our entire sample, it is found that the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ has a weak but significant correlation with the Eddington ratio, $ \Gamma=2.17+0.21\log \varepsilon$. However, this correlation is not robust because the relation is not statistically significant for its subsample of 32 RM AGNs with relatively reliable $M_{\rm BH}$ or its subsample of 166 AGNs with single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$. We do not find a statistically significant relation between the photon index and the Eddington ratio taking into account an additional dependence on $F_x$.","Chan Wang, Li-Ming Yu, Wei-Hao Bian, Bi-Xuan Zhao","Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 4 Figures, 1 Table",1905.08428v1,No journal ref found,Bi-Xuan Zhao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08428v1,2019-05-21 03:36:30+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.IM,Hot Corona Properties of Swift/BAT detected AGN,2019-05-21 03:36:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08428v1

236,"Some cataclysmic variables show short-period ($\sim$200 to $\sim$2000 s) light variations, which are attributable to nonradial pulsations of the accreting primary white dwarf. We regard these periodic variations as r-mode (global Rossby-wave) oscillations which are presumably excited mechanically and confined into hydrogen-rich layers in the white dwarf. Often observed modulations in amplitudes and frequencies even during an observing season may be interpreted as beatings among densely distributed r-mode frequencies. Making the r-mode frequency distribution of a model to be consistent (by adjusting the rotation frequency) with the observed pulsation frequencies, we obtain the best-fit rotation rate for each case. The rotation periods thus obtained for 17 accreting white dwarfs lie between 4 and 10 minutes. Pulsation frequencies observed sometime after a dwarf-nova outburst tend to be higher than the pre-outburst values, so that the best-fit rotation rate for the post-outburst frequencies is also higher. This indicates a spin-up of the hydrogen-rich layers to occur by an enhanced accretion at the outburst.

In this study, we present a novel method for relating the 2D projected fractal dimension ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$) to the 3D fractal dimension ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$) of turbulent clouds. We do this by computing the fractal dimension of clouds over two orders of magnitude in turbulent Mach number $(\mathcal{M} = 1-100)$, corresponding to seven orders of magnitude in spatial scales within the clouds. This provides us with the data to create a new empirical relation between $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$. The proposed relation is $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}) = \Omega_1 erfc ( \xi_1 erfc^{-1}[ (\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}} - \mathcal{D}_{\text{p,min}})/\Omega_2 ] + \xi_2 ) + \mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}}$, where the minimum 3D fractal dimension, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}} = 2.06 \pm 0.35$, the minimum projected fractal dimension, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p,min}} = 1.55 \pm 0.13$, $\Omega_1 = 0.47 \pm 0.18$, $\Omega_2 = 0.22 \pm 0.07$, $\xi_1 = 0.80 \pm 0.18$ and $\xi_2 = 0.26 \pm 0.19$. The minimum 3D fractal dimension, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}} = 2.06 \pm 0.35$, indicates that in the high $\mathcal{M}$ limit the 3D clouds are dominated by planar shocks. The relation between $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$ of molecular clouds may be a useful tool for those who are seeking to understand the 3D structures of molecular clouds, purely based upon 2D projected data and shows promise for relating the physics of the turbulent clouds to the fractal dimension.","James R.

In this Special Issue, we firstly discuss how magnetic fields emerge from the solar interior to the solar surface, to build up active regions, which commonly host large-scale coronal disturbances, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Then, we discuss the physical processes associated with the driving and triggering of these eruptions, the propagation of the large-scale magnetic disturbances through interplanetary space and the interaction of CMEs with Earth's magnetic field. The acceleration mechanisms for the solar energetic particles related to explosive phenomena (e.g. flares and/or CMEs) in the solar corona are also discussed.

241,"We consider torsional Alfv\'en waves which may be excited in Jupiter's metallic hydrogen region. These axisymmetric zonal flow fluctuations have previously been examined for incompressible fluids in the context of Earth's liquid iron core. Theoretical models of the deep-seated Jovian dynamo, implementing radial changes of density and electrical conductivity in the equilibrium model, have reproduced its strong, dipolar magnetic field. Analysing such models, we find anelastic torsional waves travelling perpendicular to the rotation axis in the metallic region on timescales of at least several years. Being excited by the more vigorous convection in the outer part of the dynamo region, they can propagate both inwards and outwards. When being reflected at a magnetic tangent cylinder at the transition to the molecular region, they can form standing waves. Identifying such reflections in observational data could determine the depth at which the metallic region effectively begins. Also, this may distinguish Jovian torsional waves from those in Earth's core, where observational evidence has suggested waves mainly travelling outwards from the rotation axis. These waves can transport angular momentum and possibly give rise to variations in Jupiter's rotation period of magnitude no greater than tens of milliseconds. In addition these internal disturbances could give rise to a 10% change over time in the zonal flows at a depth of 3000 km below the surface.","Kumiko Hori, Robert J.

243,"Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators often relies on the comparisons between stellar models and stellar observations in order to determine the properties of stars. The values of the global seismic parameters, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ (the frequency where the smoothed amplitude of the oscillations peak) and $\Delta \nu$ (the large frequency separation), are frequently used in grid-based modeling searches. However, the methods by which $\Delta \nu$ is calculated from observed data and how $\Delta \nu$ is calculated from stellar models are not the same. Typically for observed stars, especially for those with low signal-to-noise data, $\Delta \nu$ is calculated by taking the power spectrum of a power spectrum, or with autocorrelation techniques. However, for stellar models, the actual individual mode frequencies are calculated and the average spacing between them directly determined. In this work we try to determine the best way to combine model frequencies in order to obtain $\Delta \nu$ that can be compared with observations. For this we use stars with high signal-to-noise observations from Kepler as well as simulated TESS data of Ball et al. (2018). We find that when determining $\Delta \nu$ from individual mode frequencies the best method is to use the $\ell=0$ modes with either no weighting or with a Gaussian weighting around $\nu_\mathrm{max}$.","Lucas S.

This study focuses on the under dense regions, particularly the Local Void that lies largely in the zone of obscuration and consequently has received limited attention. Major over dense structures that bound the Local Void are the Perseus-Pisces and Norma-Pavo-Indus filaments separated by 8,500 km/s. The void network of the universe is interconnected and void passages are found from the Local Void to the adjacent very large Hercules and Sculptor voids. Minor filaments course through voids. A particularly interesting example connects the Virgo and Perseus clusters, with several substantial galaxies found along the chain in the depths of the Local Void. The Local Void has a substantial dynamical effect, causing a deviant motion of the Local Group of 200-250 km/s. The combined perturbations due to repulsion from the Local Void and attraction toward the Virgo Cluster account for about 50% of the motion of the Local Group in the rest frame given by the cosmic microwave background.","R Brent Tully, Daniel Pomarede, Romain Graziani, Helene M Courtois, Yehuda Hoffman, Edward J Shaya",18 pages; 9 figures; links to 1 video and 2 interactive models,1905.08329v1,No journal ref found,Edward J Shaya,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08329v1,2019-05-20 20:17:21+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Cosmicflows-3: Cosmography of the Local Void,2019-05-20 20:17:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08329v1
245,"Cosmic photons can be efficiently collected by broadband intensity mapping but information on their emission redshift and frequency is largely lost. We introduce a technique to statistically recover these otherwise collapsed dimensions by exploiting information in spatial fluctuations and apply it to the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) All Sky and Medium Imaging Surveys. By spatially cross-correlating photons in the GALEX far-UV (1500A) and near-UV (2300A) bands with a million spectroscopic objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of redshift, we robustly detect the redshift-dependent intensity of the UV background (UVB) modulated by its clustering bias up to $z\sim2$. These measurements clearly reveal the imprints of UVB spectral features redshifting through the filters. Using a simple parameterization, we simultaneously fit a UVB emissivity and clustering bias factor to these observations and constrain the main spectral features of the UVB spectrum: (i) the Lyman break, (ii) the non-ionizing UV continuum, which agrees with the Haardt & Madau model but does not rely on any assumption regarding the nature of the sources, and (iii) the Ly$\alpha$ emission, whose luminosity density is consistent with estimates of the combined galaxy and AGN contributions at $z\sim1$. Because the technique probes the total background including low surface brightness emission, we place constraints on the amount of UV light originating from the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Finally, the clustering bias of UV photons is found to be chromatic and evolving. Our frequency- and redshift-dependent UVB measurement delivers a summary statistic of the universe's net radiation output from stars, black holes, and the IGM combined.","Yi-Kuan Chiang, Brice MÃ©nard, David Schiminovich",Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal,1810.00885v2,No journal ref found,David Schiminovich,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00885v2,2018-10-01 18:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Broadband Intensity Tomography: Spectral Tagging of the Cosmic UV   Background,2019-05-20 20:00:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00885v2

247,"Young, fast rotating single stars can show dramatically different magnetic signatures and levels of magnetic activity as compared with the Sun. While losing angular momentum due to magnetic breaking and mass loss through stellar winds, the stars gradually spin down resulting in decreasing levels of activity. Studying magnetic activity on such solar analogues plays a key role in understanding the evolution of solar-like stars and allows a glimpse into the past of the Sun as well. In order to widen our knowledge of the magnetic evolution of the Sun and solar-like stars, magnetic activity of the young solar analogue V1358 Ori is investigated. Fourier analysis of long-term photometric data is used to derive rotational period and activity cycle length, while spectral synthesis is applied on high resolution spectroscopic data in order to derive precise astrophysical parameters. Doppler imaging is performed to recover surface temperature maps for two subsequent intervals. Cross-correlation of the consecutive Doppler maps is used to derive surface differential rotation. The rotational modulation of the chromospheric activity indicators is also investigated. An activity cycle of $\approx 1600$ days is detected for V1358 Ori. Doppler imaging revealed a surface temperature distribution dominated by a large polar cap with a few weaker features around the equator. This spot configuration is similar to other maps of young solar analogues from the literature, and supports recent model predictions. We detected solar-like surface differential rotation with a surface shear parameter of $\alpha = 0.016 \pm 0.010$ which fits pretty well to our recently proposed empirical relation between rotation and differential rotation. The chromospheric activity indicators showed a rotational modulation.","L. Kriskovics, Zs. KÅvÃ¡ri, K. Vida, K. OlÃ¡h, T. A. Carroll, T.

248,"Solar flare X-ray spectra are typically dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the soft X-ray ($\lesssim$10 keV) energy range; for hard X-ray energies ($\gtrsim$30 keV), emission is typically non-thermal from beams of electrons. The low-energy extent of non-thermal emission has only been loosely quantified. It has been difficult to obtain a lower limit for a possible non-thermal cutoff energy due to the significantly dominant thermal emission.   Here we use solar flare data from the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-ray data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to calculate the Differential Emission Measure (DEM). This improvement over the isothermal approximation and any single-instrument DEM helps to resolve ambiguities in the range where thermal and non-thermal emission overlap, and to provide constraints on the low-energy cutoff.   In the model, thermal emission is from a DEM that is parametrized as multiple gaussians in $Log(T)$. Non-thermal emission results from a photon spectrum obtained using a thick-target emission model. Spectra for both instruments are fit simultaneously in a self-consistent manner.   Our results have been obtained using a sample of 52 large (GOES X- and M-class) solar flares observed between February 2011 and February 2013. It turns out that it is often possible to determine low-energy cutoffs early (in the first two minutes) during large flares. Cutoff energies are typically low, less than 10 keV, with most values of the lower limits in the 5--7 keV range.","James M. McTiernan, Amir Caspi, Harry P.

249,"We investigate how the stellar and gas-phase He abundances evolve as functions of time within three simulated star-forming disc galaxies, characterised by different star formation histories. We make use of a cosmological chemodynamical simulation for galaxy formation and evolution, which includes star formation, as well as energy and chemical enrichment feedback from asymptotic giant branch stars, core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. The predicted relations between the He mass fraction, $Y$, and the metallicity, $Z$, in the interstellar medium of our simulated disc galaxies depend on the past galaxy star formation history. In particular, we find that $dY/dZ$ is not constant and evolves as a function of time, depending on the specific chemical element that we choose to trace $Z$, with $dY/dX_{\text{O}}$ and $dY/dX_{\text{C}}$ increasing as functions of time, and $dY/dX_{\text{N}}$ decreasing as a function of time. Interestingly, $dY/dX_{\text{C+N}}$ evolves very weakly, being always in the range $\approx[6.4,6.6]$. We predict negative radial gradients for the gas-phase He abundances in our simulated disc galaxies, due to the galaxy inside-out growth as a function of time, which gives rise to longer chemical enrichment time scales in the outer galaxy regions, where we find lower average values for $Y$ and $Z$. In order to calibrate the $Y$-$Z$ relation to assume in stellar models, we conclude that C, N, and C+N are better proxies for the metallicity than O, because they show steeper and less scattered relations in the interstellar medium at any epoch of the galaxy evolution.","Fiorenzo Vincenzo, Andrea Miglio, Chiaki Kobayashi, J.

250,"As galaxies evolve, they must enrich and exchange gas with the surrounding medium, but the timing of these processes and how much gas is involved remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage metals as tracers of past gas flows to constrain the history of metal ejection and redistribution in M31. This roughly $L*$ galaxy is a unique case where spatially resolved measurements of the gas-phase and stellar metallicity, dust extinction, and neutral ISM gas content are all available, enabling a census of the present metal mass. We combine spatially resolved star formation histories from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey with a metal production model to calculate the history of metal production in M31. We find that $1.8\times10^9 \, M_\odot$ of metals, or 62\% of the metal mass formed within $r < 19 \,\mathrm{kpc}$, is missing from the disk in our fiducial model, implying that the M31 disk has experienced significant gaseous outflows over its lifetime. Under a conservative range of model assumptions, we find that between 3\% and 88\% of metals have been lost ($1.9\times10^7 - 6.4\times10^9 \, M_\odot$), so metals are missing even when all model parameters are chosen to favor metal retention. We show that the missing metal mass could be harbored in M31's CGM if the majority of the metals reside in a hot gas phase. Finally, we find that some metal mass produced in the past 1.5 Gyr in the central $\sim5 \,\mathrm{kpc}$ has likely been redistributed to larger radii within the disk.","O. Grace Telford, Jessica K.

251,"Aims. We use Hermite splines to interpolate pressure and its derivatives simultaneously, thereby preserving mathematical relations between the derivatives. The method therefore guarantees that thermodynamic identities are obeyed even between mesh points. In addition, our method enables an estimation of the precision of the interpolation by comparing the Hermite-spline results with those of frequent cubic (B-) spline interpolation.   Methods. We have interpolated pressure as a function of temperature and density with quintic Hermite 2D-splines. The Hermite interpolation requires knowledge of pressure and its first and second derivatives at every mesh point. To obtain the partial derivatives at the mesh points, we used tabulated values if given or else thermodynamic equalities, or, if not available, values obtained by differentiating B-splines.   Results. The results were obtained with the grid of the SAHA-S equation-of-state (EOS) tables. The maximum $lg P$ difference lies in the range from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-4}$, and $\Gamma_1$ difference varies from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-3}$. Specifically, for the points of a solar model, the maximum differences are one order of magnitude smaller than the aforementioned values. The poorest precision is found in the dissociation and ionization regions, occurring at $T \sim 1.5\cdot 10^3 - 10^5$ K. The best precision is achieved at higher temperatures, $T>10^5$ K. To discuss the significance of the interpolation errors we compare them with the corresponding difference between two different equation-of-state formalisms, SAHA-S and OPAL 2005. We find that the interpolation errors of the pressure are a few orders of magnitude less than the differences from between the physical formalisms, which is particularly true for the solar-model points.","V.

253,"We use APEX mapping observations of 13CO, and C18O (2-1) to investigate the internal gas kinematics of the filamentary cloud G350.54+0.69, composed of the two distinct filaments G350.5-N and G350.5-S. G350.54+0.69 as a whole is supersonic and gravitationally bound. We find a large-scale periodic velocity oscillation along the entire G350.5-N filament with a wavelength of ~1.3 pc and an amplitude of ~0.12 km/s. Comparing with gravitational-instability induced core formation models, we conjecture that this periodic velocity oscillation could be driven by a combination of longitudinal gravitational instability and a large-scale periodic physical oscillation along the filament. The latter may be an example of an MHD transverse wave. This hypothesis can be tested with Zeeman and dust polarization measurements.","Hong-Li Liu, Amelia Stutz, Jing-Hua Yuan",10 pages with 9 figures.

We use these to forecast how the addition of Gravitational Wave standard sirens data can improve current limits on the Dark Matter -- Dark Energy coupling strength ($\xi$). We find that the addition of Gravitational Waves data can reduce the current uncertainty by a factor of $5$. Moreover, if the underlying cosmological model truly features Dark Matter -- Dark Energy interactions with a value of $\xi$ within the currently allowed $1\sigma$ upper limit, the addition of Gravitational Wave data would help disentangle such an interaction from the standard case of no interaction at a significance of more than $3\sigma$.","Weiqiang Yang, Sunny Vagnozzi, Eleonora Di Valentino, Rafael C.

255,"The MAGIC observations of late sub-TeV photons from GRB190114C enable us, for the first time, to determine the details of the emission process in a GRB afterglow and to pin down the physical parameters, such as the bulk Lorentz factor and the Lorentz factor of the emitting electrons as well as some of the microphysical parameters. We find that the sub-TeV emission is an Inverse Compton radiation produced at the early afterglow stage. Combining the sub-TeV and X-ray observations we narrow uncertainties in the conditions inside the emitting zone, almost eliminating them for some parameters. Seventy seconds after the trigger the forward shock had Lorentz factor $\simeq 100$ and the electrons producing the observed sub-TeV radiation had a Lorentz factor $\simeq 10^4$, so that the sub-TeV radiation originates from Comptonization of X-ray photons at the border between Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes. The inferred conditions within the emitting zone are at odds with theoretical expectations unless one assumes moderate (with $\tau \simeq 2$) absorption of sub-TeV photons inside the source. With this correction the conditions are in good agreement with predictions of the pair-balance model, but are also acceptable for generic afterglow model as one of many possibilities. However, the temporal evolution of the Inverse Compton peak energyis very different in these two models. This opens a way to discriminate between the models once late-time detection in the TeV range become available.","Evgeny Derishev, Tsvi Piran",No comment found,1905.08285v1,No journal ref found,Tsvi Piran,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08285v1,2019-05-20 18:22:26+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,The physical conditions of the afterglow implied by MAGIC's sub-TeV   observations of GRB 190114C,2019-05-20 18:22:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08285v1
256,"We present self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hydrogen reionization performed with Arepo-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. We examine how photoheating feedback, due to reionization, shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization by $z\approx6$ and matches observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the CMB electron scattering optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star formation rates by more than $50\%$ only in halos less massive than $\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$) at $z=6$ $(z=5)$, suggesting inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a uniform UV background that heats up the gas at $z\approx10.7$ generates an earlier onset of suppression of star formation compared to our fiducial model. This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model with a more realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback, photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\ M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$, implying that photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback, implemented as a non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of photoheating feedback by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most importantly, photoheating does not leave observable imprints in the UV luminosity function, stellar mass function, or the cosmic star formation rate density. The feasibility of using these observables to detect imprints of reionization therefore requires further investigation.","Xiaohan Wu, Rahul Kannan, Federico Marinacci, Mark Vogelsberger, Lars Hernquist","submitted to MNRAS, 19 pages, comments welcome",1903.06167v2,No journal ref found,Lars Hernquist,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06167v2,2019-03-14 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,Simulating the effect of photoheating feedback during reionization,2019-05-20 18:19:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06167v2
257,"High redshift quasars emit copious X-ray photons which heat the intergalactic medium to temperatures up to $\sim$ 10$^6$ K. At such high temperatures the primordial gas will not form stars until it is assembled into dark matter haloes with masses of up to $\sim$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, at which point the hot gas collapses and cools under the influence of gravity. Once this occurs, there is a massive reservoir of primordial gas from which stars can form, potentially setting the stage for the brightest Population (Pop) III starbursts in the early Universe. Supporting this scenario, recent observations of quasars at z $\sim$ 6 have revealed a lack of accompanying Lyman $\alpha$ emitting galaxies, consistent with suppression of primordial star formation in haloes with masses below $\sim$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. Here we model the chemical and thermal evolution of the primordial gas as it collapses into such a massive halo irradiated by a nearby quasar in the run-up to a massive Pop III starburst. We find that within $\sim$ 100 kpc of the highest redshift quasars discovered to date the Lyman-Werner flux produced in the quasar host galaxy may be high enough to stimulate the formation of a direct collapse black hole (DCBH). A survey with single pointings of the NIRCam instrument at individual known high-z quasars may be a promising strategy for finding Pop III stars and DCBHs with the James Webb Space Telescope.","Jarrett L.

258,"Large-scale magnetic fields in stars and galaxies are thought to arise by mean-field dynamo action due to the combined influence of both helical turbulence and shear. Those systems are also highly conducting and the turbulence therein leads to a fluctuation (or small-scale) dynamo which more rapidly amplifies magnetic field fluctuations on the eddy scales and smaller. Will this then interfere with and suppress the mean (or large-scale) field growth? Using direct numerical simulations of helical turbulence (with and without shear), we identify a novel quasi-kinematic large-scale dynamo which operates as the small-scale dynamo saturates. Thus both dynamos operate efficiently, one after the other, and lead to the generation of significant large-scale fields.","Pallavi Bhat, Kandaswamy Subramanian, Axel Brandenburg","8 pages, 11 figures.

259,"Obtaining a faithful source intensity distribution map of the sky from noisy data demands incorporating known information of the expected signal, especially when the signal is weak compared to the noise. We introduce a widely used procedure to incorporate these priors through a Bayesian regularisation scheme in the context of map-making of the anisotropic stochastic GW background (SGWB). Specifically, we implement the quadratic form of regularizing function with varying strength of regularization and study its effect on image restoration for different types of the injected source intensity distribution in simulated LIGO data. We find that regularization significantly enhances the quality of reconstruction, especially when the intensity of the source is weak, and dramatically improves the stability of deconvolution. We further study the quality of reconstruction as a function of regularization constant. While in principle this constant is dependent on the data set, we show that the deconvolution process is robust against the choice of the constant, as long as it is chosen from a broad range of values obtained by the method presented here.","Sambit Panda, Swetha Bhagwat, Jishnu Suresh, Sanjit Mitra","14 pages, 8 figures and 1 table",1905.08276v1,No journal ref found,Sanjit Mitra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08276v1,2019-05-20 18:05:58+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.IM,Stochastic gravitational wave background mapmaking using regularised   deconvolution,2019-05-20 18:05:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08276v1
260,"Growing interests in the chemical feature of r-process elements among nearby disk stars represented by the [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram have sprouted since it can assess the origin of r-process elements through the comparison with theoretical models, including a test as to if neutron star mergers can be the major site of r-process nucleosynthesis. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that local chemistry is strongly coupled with the dynamics of Galactic disk, which predicts that stars radially move on the disk where the observed elemental feature is different at various Galactocentric distances. Here, we show that radial migration of stars across the Galactic disk plays a crucial role in shaping the r-process abundance feature in the solar vicinity. In this proposed scenario, we highlight the importance of migration from the outer disk where [r-process/Fe] of some old stars is predicted to be enhanced to the level beyond the expectation from the observed Galactic Fe and Eu radial gradient, which results in a large span of [r-process/Fe] among nearby disk stars. The variation in the [r-process/Fe] ratio seen across the Galactic disk as well as in dwarf galaxies may be an outcome of different stellar initial mass functions which change the occurrence frequency between supernovae leaving behind neutron stars and ones ending with black holes. Here we propose that enhancement in [Eu/Fe] is attributed to the initial mass function lacking high-mass stars such as > 25 solar masses in the scheme for which neutron star mergers are a major source of r-process elements.","Takuji Tsujimoto, Junichi Baba","11 pages including 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.08275v1,No journal ref found,Junichi Baba,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08275v1,2019-05-20 18:04:51+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Galactic r-process abundance feature shaped by radial migration,2019-05-20 18:04:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08275v1

We identify two events with maxima in 2019 that require urgent follow-up. First, we predict that the nearby M2 dwarf L 338-152 will align with a background source with a closest approach of $35^{+35}_{-23}$ mas on 2019 November $16^{+28}_{-27}$ d. This will cause a peak astrometric shift and photometric amplification of the background source of $2.7^{+3.5}_{-1.5}$ mas and $5.6^{+143.2}_{-5.2}$ mmag respectively. This event should be astrometrically detectable by both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research instrument on the Very Large Telescope. Secondly, we predict the likely K dwarf NLTT 45128 will lens a background source with a closest approach of $105.3^{+12.2}_{-11.7}$ mas on 2019 September $26^{+15}_{-15}$ d. This will produce a peak astrometric shift of $0.329^{+0.065}_{-0.059}$ mas. NLTT 45128 is only 3.6 magnitudes brighter than the background source which makes it an excellent candidate for follow-up with HST.

We use an iterative prewhitening procedure to characterize the short-timescale variability in all eight stars. The periodogram of one of the YSGs, HD 269953, displays multiple strong peaks at higher frequencies than its fellows. While the field surrounding HD 269953 is quite crowded, it is the brightest star in the region, and has infrared colors indicating it is dusty. We suggest HD 269953 may be in a post-red supergiant evolutionary phase. We find a signal with a period of $\sim5$ days for the LBV HD 269582. The periodogram of S Doradus shows a complicated structure, with peaks below frequencies of 1.5 cycles per day. We fit the shape of the background noise of all eight light curves, and find a red noise component in all of them. However, the power law slope of the red noise and the timescale over which coherent structures arise changes from star to star.

264,"Context. The solar chromosphere and the lower transition region is believed to play a crucial role in the heating of the solar corona. Models that describe the chromosphere (and the lower transition region), accounting for its highly dynamic and structured character are, so far, found to be lacking. This is partly due to the breakdown of complete frequency redistribution in the chromospheric layers and also because of the difficulty in obtaining complete sets of observations that adequately constrain the solar atmosphere at all relevant heights. Aims. We aim to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres that reproduce the features of the Mg II h&k line profiles that sample the middle chromosphere with focus on a sunspot. Methods. We use spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8542 A spectra obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and use NICOLE inversions to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres for different features in and around a sunspot. These are used to synthesize Mg II h&k spectra using RH1.5D code, which we compare with observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Results. Comparison of the synthetic profiles with IRIS observations reveals that there are several areas, especially in the penumbra of the sunspot, where most of the observed Mg II h&k profiles are very well reproduced. In addition, we find that supersonic hot downflows, present in our collection of models in the umbra, lead to synthetic profiles that agree well with the IRIS Mg II h&k profiles, with the exception of the line core. Conclusions. We put forward and make available four semi-empirical model atmospheres. Two for the penumbra, reflecting the range of temperatures obtained for the chromosphere, one for umbral flashes, and a model representative of the quiet surroundings of a sunspot. These are available in electronic as well as in table formats.","Souvik Bose, Vasco M. J. Henriques, Luc Rouppe van der Voort, Tiago M. D.

We consider that all the cosmological observables include not only the background quantity, but also the perturbation quantity, and they are subject to cosmic variance, which sets the fundamental limits on the cosmological information that can be derived from such observables, even in an idealized survey with an infinite number of observations. To quantify the maximum cosmological information content, we apply the Fisher information matrix formalism and spherical harmonic analysis to cosmological observations, in which the angular and the radial positions of the observables on the light cone carry different information. We discuss the maximum cosmological information that can be derived from five different observables: (1) type Ia supernovae, (2) cosmic microwave background anisotropies, (3) weak gravitational lensing, (4) local baryon density, and (5) galaxy clustering. We compare our results with the cosmic variance obtained in the standard approaches, which treat the light cone volume as a cubic box of simultaneity.

267,"We present observations of the HD 15115 debris disk from ALMA at 1.3 mm that capture this intriguing system with the highest resolution ($0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}6$ or $29$ AU) at millimeter wavelengths to date. This new ALMA image shows evidence for two rings in the disk separated by a cleared gap. By fitting models directly to the observed visibilities within a MCMC framework, we are able to characterize the millimeter continuum emission and place robust constraints on the disk structure and geometry. In the best-fit model of a power law disk with a Gaussian gap, the disk inner and outer edges are at $43.9\pm5.8$ AU ($0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}89\pm0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}12$) and $92.2\pm2.4$ AU ($1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}88\pm0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}49$), respectively, with a gap located at $58.9\pm4.5$~AU ($1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2\pm0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}10$) with a fractional depth of $0.88\pm0.10$ and a width of $13.8\pm5.6$ AU ($0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}28\pm0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}11$). Since we do not see any evidence at millimeter wavelengths for the dramatic east-west asymmetry seen in scattered light, we conclude that this feature most likely results from a mechanism that only affects small grains.

268,"It has been recently suggested that the multiple concentric rings and gaps discovered by ALMA in many protoplanetary disks may be produced by a single planet, as a result of the complex propagation and dissipation of the multiple spiral density waves it excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to verify this idea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with a prescribed disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this approximation does not provide an accurate description of the density wave dynamics on scales of tens of au. Moreover, we show that locally isothermal simulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well as misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the energy equation is evolved explicitly. This outcome is caused by the non-conservation of the angular momentum flux of linear perturbations in locally isothermal disks. We demonstrate this effect using simulations of locally isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially identical temperature profiles) and show how the dust distributions, probed by mm wavelength observations, differ between the two cases. Locally isothermal simulations may thus underestimate the masses of planets responsible for the formation of multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of au observed by ALMA.

269,"We study the formation and evolution of a sample of Lyman Break Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization by using high-resolution ($\sim 10 \,{\rm pc}$), cosmological zoom-in simulations part of the SERRA suite. In SERRA, we follow the interstellar medium (ISM) thermo-chemical non-equilibrium evolution, and perform on-the-fly radiative transfer of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The simulation outputs are post-processed to compute the emission of far infrared lines ([CII], [NII], and [OIII]). At $z=8$, the most massive galaxy, `Freesia', has an age $t_\star \simeq 409\,{\rm Myr}$, stellar mass $M_{\star} \simeq 4.2\times 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and a star formation rate ${\rm SFR} \simeq 11.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, due to a recent burst. Freesia has two stellar components (A and B) separated by $\simeq 2.5\, {\rm kpc}$; other 11 galaxies are found within $56.9 \pm 21.6 \, {\rm kpc}$. The mean ISRF in the Habing band is $G = 7.9\, G_0$ and is spatially uniform; in contrast, the ionisation parameter is $U = 2^{+20}_{-2} \times 10^{-3}$, and has a patchy distribution peaked at the location of star-forming sites. The resulting ionising escape fraction from Freesia is $f_{\rm esc}\simeq 2\%$. While [CII] emission is extended (radius 1.54 kpc), [OIII] is concentrated in Freesia-A (0.85 kpc), where the ratio $\Sigma_{\rm [OIII]}/\Sigma_{\rm [CII]} \simeq 10$. As many high-$z$ galaxies, Freesia lies below the local [CII]-SFR relation. We show that this is the general consequence of a starburst phase (pushing the galaxy above the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) which disrupts/photodissociates the emitting molecular clouds around star-forming sites. Metallicity has a sub-dominant impact on the amplitude of [CII]-SFR deviations.","A. Pallottini, A. Ferrara, D Decataldo, S. Gallerani, L. Vallini, S. Carniani, C. Behrens, M. Kohandel, S.

270,"We revisit the efficiency of Schwinger mechanism in creating charged pairs during inflation. We consider a minimal setup of inflation in which the inflaton field is a complex scalar field charged under a $U(1)$ gauge field. There is a time dependent conformal coupling which pumps energy from the inflaton field to the gauge field to furnish a nearly constant background electric field energy density to drive the Schwinger mechanism. The coupling between the gauge field and the scalar field induces a time dependent effective mass for the inflaton field. The requirement of a long period of slow-roll inflation causes the Schwinger mechanism to be highly inefficient during inflation. The non-perturbative Schwinger mechanism can be relevant only towards the end of inflation and only on very small scales. This is in contrast to hypothetical models studied in literature in which the complex scalar field is a test field and a constant electric field is imposed on the dS background by hand. We calculate the number of pairs of charged particles created perturbatively during inflation. We show that it is proportional to the amplitude of the quadrupolar statistical anisotropy and it is very small. Consequently, the back-reactions of created particles on magnetogenesis on large scales are negligible.","Soroush Shakeri, Mohammad Ali Gorji, Hassan Firouzjahi","23 pages, 3 figures, matches published version in PRD",1903.05310v2,No journal ref found,Hassan Firouzjahi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05310v2,2019-03-13 04:45:33+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Schwinger Mechanism During Inflation,2019-05-20 17:54:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05310v2

However, it is also known that there are examples with $\phi\propto1/\sqrt{\omega}$ that does not tend to GR. We discuss another case: a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with stiff matter.

272,"We investigate the ability of current and third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors to determine the delay time distribution (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) through a direct measurement of the BNS merger rate as a function of redshift. We assume that the DTD follows a power law distribution with a slope $\Gamma$ and a minimum merger time $t_{\rm min}$, and also allow the overall BNS formation efficiency per unit stellar mass to vary. By convolving the DTD and mass efficiency with the cosmic star formation history, and then with the GW detector capabilities, we explore two relevant regimes. First, for the current generation of GW detectors, which are only sensitive to the local universe, but can lead to precise redshift determinations via the identification of electromagnetic counterparts and host galaxies, we show that the DTD parameters are strongly degenerate with the unknown mass efficiency and therefore cannot be determined uniquely. Second, for third-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), which will detect BNS mergers at cosmological distances, but with a redshift uncertainty inherent to GW-only detections ($\delta(z)/z\approx 0.1z$), we show that the DTD and mass efficiency can be well-constrained to better than 10\% with a year of observations. This long-term approach to determining the DTD through a direct mapping of the BNS merger redshift distribution will be supplemented by more near term studies of the DTD through the properties of BNS merger host galaxies at $z\approx 0$ (Safarzadeh & Berger 2019).","Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Edo Berger, Ken K. -Y.

274,"We present magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the evolution from quasi-equilibrium to onset of eruption of a twisted, prominence-forming coronal magnetic flux rope underlying a corona streamer. The flux rope is built up by an imposed flux emergence at the lower boundary. During the quasi-static phase of the evolution, we find the formation of a prominence-cavity system with qualitative features resembling observations, as shown by the synthetic SDO/AIA EUV images with the flux rope observed above the limb viewed nearly along its axis. The cavity contains substructures including ``U''-shaped or horn-liked features extending from the prominence enclosing a central ``cavity'' on top of the prominence. The prominence condensations form in the dips of the highly twisted field lines due to runaway radiative cooling and the cavity is formed by the density depleted portions of the prominence-carrying field lines extending up from the dips. The prominence ``horns'' are threaded by twisted field lines containing shallow dips, where the prominence condensations have evaporated to coronal temperatures. The central ``cavity'' enclosed by the horns is found to correspond to a central hot and dense core containing twisted field lines that do not have dips. The flux rope eventually erupts as its central part rises quasi-statically to a critical height consistent with the onset of the torus instability. The erupting flux rope accelerates to a fast speed of nearly 900 km/s and the associated prominence eruption shows significant rotational motion and a kinked morphology.","Yuhong Fan, Tie Liu","18 pages, 12 figures, published in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space

275,"The \lya forest at high redshifts is a powerful probe of reionization. Modeling and observing this imprint comes with significant technical challenges: inhomogeneous reionization must be taken into account while simultaneously being able to resolve the web-like small-scale structure prior to reionization. In this work we quantify the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the \lya forest at lower redshifts ($2 < z < 4$), where upcoming surveys such as DESI will enable precision measurements of the flux power spectrum. We use both small box simulations capable of handling the small-scale structure of the \lya forest and semi-numerical large box simulations capable of representing the effects of inhomogeneous reionization. We find that inhomogeneous reionization could produce a measurable effect on the \lya forest power spectrum. The deviation in the 3D power spectrum at $z_{\rm obs} = 4$ and $k = 0.14 \ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ranges from $19 - 36\%$, with a larger effect for later reionization. The corrections decrease to $2.0 - 4.1\%$ by $z_{\rm obs} = 2$. The impact on the 1D power spectrum is smaller, and ranges from $3.3 - 6.5\%$ at $z_{\rm obs}=4$ to $0.35 - 0.75\%$ at $z_{\rm obs}=2$, values which are comparable to the statistical uncertainties in current and upcoming surveys. Furthermore, we study how can this systematic be constrained with the help of the quadrupole of the 21 cm power spectrum.","Paulo Montero-Camacho, Christopher M.

276,"Non-thermal desorption from icy grains containing H$_2$CO has been invoked to explain the observed H$_2$CO gas phase abundances in ProtoPlanetary Disks (PPDs) and Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs). Photodesorption is thought to play a key role, however no absolute measurement of the photodesorption from H$_2$CO ices were performed up to now, so that a default value is used in the current astrophysical models. As photodesorption yields differ from one molecule to the other, it is crucial to experimentally investigate photodesorption from H$_2$CO ices.   We measured absolute wavelength-resolved photodesorption yields from pure H$_2$CO ices, H$_2$CO on top of a CO ice (H$_2$CO/CO), and H$_2$CO mixed with CO ice (H$_2$CO:CO) irradiated in the Vacuum UltraViolet (VUV) range (7-13.6~eV). Photodesorption from a pure H$_2$CO ice releases H$_2$CO in the gas phase, but also fragments, such as CO and H$_2$. Energy-resolved photodesorption spectra, coupled with InfraRed (IR) and Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) diagnostics, showed the important role played by photodissociation and allowed to discuss photodesorption mechanisms. For the release of H$_2$CO in the gas phase, they include Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET), indirect DIET through CO-induced desorption of H$_2$CO and photochemical desorption.   We found that H$_2$CO photodesorbs with an average efficiency of $\sim 4-10 \times 10^{-4}$ molecule/photon, in various astrophysical environments. H$_2$CO and CO photodesorption yields and photodesorption mechanisms, involving photofragmentation of H$_2$CO, can be implemented in astrochemical codes. The effects of photodesorption on gas/solid abundances of H$_2$CO and all linked species from CO to Complex Organic Molecules (COMs), and on the H$_2$CO snowline location, are now on the verge of being unravelled.","GÃ©raldine FÃ©raud, Mathieu Bertin, Claire Romanzin, RÃ©mi Dupuy, Franck Le Petit, Evelyne Roueff, Laurent Philippe, Xavier Michaut, Pascal Jeseck, Jean-Hugues Fillion","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry; Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in

277,"The question of what triggered the nongravitational acceleration of 1I/`Oumuamua continues to attract researchers' attention. The absence of any signs of activity notwithstanding, the prevailing notion is that the acceleration of the stellar, cigar-like object was prompted by outgassing. However, the Spitzer Space Telescope's failure to detect `Oumuamua not only ruled out the CO_2 and/or CO driven activity (Trilling et al. 2018), but made the cigar shape incompatible with the optical observations. Choice of water ice as the source of outgassing is shown to be flawed as well: (i) the water sublimation law is demonstrably inconsistent with the observed variations in the nongravitational acceleration derived by Micheli et al. (2018), the point that should have been assertively highlighted; and (ii) an upper limit of the production rate of water is estimated at as low as 4 x 10^(23) molecules s^(-1), requiring that, at most, only a small area of the surface be active. In this case the conservation of momentum law is satisfied only when `Oumuamua's bulk density is extremely low, <0.001 g cm^(-3), reminiscent of the formerly proposed scenario with `Oumuamua as a fragment of a dwarf interstellar comet, possibly an embryo planetesimal, disintegrating near perihelion, with the acceleration driven by solar radiation pressure (Sekanina 2019a) and no need for activity at all.

In this work, starting from commutation relations between phase-space operators (in ``first quantization'') we define averaged creation and annihilation operators and show that they satisfy a simple, deformed commutation relation. By extending this relation to the quantized electromagnetic field, we are led to non-linear de Broglie relations for photons, which appreciably differ from $E=\hbar \omega$ and $\mathbf{p}=\hbar \mathbf{k}$ only in the VHE regime.

279,"Quasar outflows are fundamental components of quasar environments that might play an important role in feedback to galaxy evolution. We report on the emergence of a remarkable new outflow absorption-line system in the quasar PG1411+442 (redshift ~0.089) detected in the UV and visible with the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, respectively. This new ""transient'' system contains thousands of lines, including FeII and FeII* from excited states up to 3.89 eV, HI* Balmer lines, NaI D 5890,5896, and the first detection of HeI* 5876 in a quasar. The transient absorber is spatially inhomogeneous and compact, with sizes ~<0.003 pc, based on covering fractions on the quasar continuum source ranging from ~0.45 in strong UV lines to ~0.04 in NaI D. Cloudy photoionization simulations show that large total column densities log N_H(cm^-2) >~ 23.4 and an intense radiation field ~<0.4~pc from the quasar are needed to produce the observed lines in thick zones of both fully-ionised and partially-ionised gas. The densities are conservatively log n_H(cm-3) >~ 7 based on FeII*, HI*, and HeI* but they might reach log n_H(cm^-3) >~ 10 based on NaI D. The transient lines appear at roughly the same velocity shift, v ~ -1900 km/s, as a ""mini-BAL'' outflow detected previously, but with narrower Doppler widths, b ~ 100 km/s, and larger column densities in more compact outflow structures. We propose that the transient lines identify a clumpy outflow from the broad emission-line region that, at its current speed and location, is still gravitationally bound to the central black hole.","Fred Hamann, Todd M.

280,"We study how the shape of the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves can be constrained by future experiments looking at the B-mode of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization. We implement a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) including the effects of diffuse foreground residuals, following component separation, in the uncertainty of CMB angular power spectra, and taking into account the gravitational lensing by Large Scale Structure. We perform our study by considering the capabilities of future B-mode CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory (SO) and Stage-IV (CMB-S4), in particular in detecting deviations of the primordial tensor spectrum from the scale-invariant behavior. We find that diffuse foreground residuals impact substantially both the derivation of the PCA basis and the corresponding constraining power, in all cases. In particular, depending on which experimental specifications and which value $r$ of tensor-to-scalar ratio for cosmological perturbations are considered, adding foregrounds residuals can determine an increase as large as a factor $\sim 4$ both on the uncertainty on $r$ and on the recovery of the PCA modes. We study the limitations of the methodology, including the effect of physicality priors on the PCA, which we quantify via a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analysis of the combined cosmological and PCA power spectrum parameter space.","Paolo Campeti, Davide Poletti, Carlo Baccigalupi","32 pages, 16 figures, submitted to JCAP",1905.08200v1,No journal ref found,Carlo Baccigalupi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08200v1,2019-05-20 16:34:09+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Principal component analysis of the primordial tensor power spectrum,2019-05-20 16:34:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08200v1

This new sample extends our reddened quasar search to both brighter and fainter luminosities. 25 of the 26 candidates are confirmed to be broad line quasars with redshifts $0.7<z<2.6$ and dust extinctions $0.5<E(B-V)<3.0$. Combining with previously identified samples, we study the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and [OIII] emission line properties in 22 heavily reddened quasars with $L_{bol}\approx 10^{47}$ erg/s and $z>2$. We present the first comparison of the [OIII] line properties in high luminosity obscured quasars to a large sample of 111 unobscured quasars in the same luminosity and redshift range. Broad wings extending to velocities of 2500 km/s are seen in the [OIII] emission line profiles of our reddened quasars, suggesting that strong outflows are affecting the ionised gas kinematics. However, we find no significant difference between the kinematics of the [OIII] emission in reddened and unobscured quasars when the two samples are matched in luminosity and redshift. Our results are consistent with a model where quasar-driven outflows persist for some time after the obscuring dust has been cleared from along the line of sight. Assuming the amount of ionised gas in obscured and unobscured quasars is similar, we use the equivalent width distribution of the [OIII] emission to constrain the location of the obscuring dust in our reddened quasars. We find that the dust is most likely to be located on galactic scales, outside the [OIII] emitting region.","Matthew J. Temple, Manda Banerji, Paul C.

282,"The Alfv\'en wave energy flux in the corona can be explored using the electron density and velocity amplitude of the waves. The velocity amplitude of Alfv\'en waves can be obtained from the non-thermal velocity of the spectral line profiles. Previous calculations of the Alfv\'en wave energy flux with height in active regions and polar coronal holes have provided evidence for the damping of Alfv\'en waves with height. We present off-limb Hinode EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS) observations of a long coronal loop up to 1.4~R$_\odot$. We have obtained the electron density along the loop and found the loop to be almost in hydrostatic equilibrium. We obtained the temperature using the EM-loci method and found the loop to be isothermal across, as well as along, the loop with a temperature of about 1.37 MK. We significantly improve the estimate of non-thermal velocities over previous studies by using the estimated ion (equal to electron) temperature. Estimates of electron densities are improved using the significant updates of the CHIANTI v.8 atomic data. More accurate measurements of propagating Alfv\'en wave energy along the coronal loop and its damping are presented up to distances of 1.4 R$_\odot$, further than have been previously explored.

284,"A major outstanding question regarding the formation of planetary systems is whether wide-orbit giant planets form differently than close-in giant planets. We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: 1) the relative mass function and 2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions, and the detection limits on lower-mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that 1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of $N\propto M^{-1.3\pm0.3}$, and consequently, 2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected sub-stellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.","Kevin Wagner, DÃ¡niel Apai, Kaitlin M.

285,"The Crab pulsar displayed its largest glitch on 2017 November. An extended initial spin-up phase of this largest glitch was resolved, for the first time with high cadence of observations both in radio and X-rays on a time-scale of 2 days. A combination of crustquake and vortex unpinning models is invoked to account for the extended spin-up, magnitude and post-glitch relaxation characteristics of this glitch. We evaluate the extended spin-up followed by the familiar spin-down as due to the creep response to the initial induced inward motion of some vortex lines pinned to broken crustal plates moving inward towards the rotation axis, together with the common and familiar post-glitch creep response to the sudden outward motion of vortices unpinned at the glitch. Our analysis confirms that the number of unpinned vortices participating in glitches are similar in all Crab glitches, and within an order of magnitude in all glitches from all pulsars. This typical number of unpinned vortices is related to the broken plate size in quakes as triggers for vortex unpinning avalanches. The physical determinant of this universal broken plate size is in turn the critical strain angle in the neutron star crust. Occurrence of this largest Crab glitch after a relatively long inactive period is consistent with accumulation of the pinned vorticity to be tapped.","Erbil GÃ¼gercinoÄlu, M.

286,"In the present paper we discuss on the issue that arises when one tries to classify the gravitational theories into scalar-tensor theories or general relativity with a scalar field non-minimally coupled to matter. Despite that the issue might seem like a trivial one, some confusion might arise when dealing with higher-derivatives Horndeski theories that at first sight do not look like scalar-tensor theories. To further complicate things, the discussion on the physical equivalence of the different conformal frames in which a given scalar-tensor theory may be formulated, makes even harder to achieve a correct classification.","Israel Quiros, Francisco Antonio Horta-Rangel, Roberto De Arcia, Ismael Delgado Gaspar, Ricardo GarcÃ­a-Salcedo, Tame Gonzalez","27 pages, no figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with

287,"Future missions for long gammma-ray burst (GRB) observations at high redshift such as HiZ-GUNDAM and THESEUS will provide clue to the star formation history in our universe. In this paper focusing on high redshift (z>8) GRBs, we calculate the detection rate of long GRBs by future observations, considering both Population (Pop) I&II stars and Pop III stars as GRB progenitors. For the Pop I&II star formation rate (SFR), we adopt an up-to-date model of high-redshift SFR based on the halo mass function and dark matter accretion rate obtained from cosmological simulations. We show that the Pop I&II GRB rate steeply decreases with redshift. This would rather enable us to detect the different type of GRBs, Pop III GRBs, at very high redshift. If 10% or more Pop III stars die as an ultra-long GRB, the future missions would detect such GRBs in one year in spite of their low fluence. More luminous GRBs are expected from massive compact Pop III stars produced via the binary merger. In our conventional case, the detection rate of such luminous GRBs is 3-20 /yr (z>8). Those future observations contribute to revealing of the Pop III star formation history.","Tomoya Kinugawa, Yuichi Harikane, Katsuaki Asano",comments welcome.

288,"We present a new abundance analysis of HD 55496, previously known as a metal-poor barium star. We found that HD 55496 has a metallicity [Fe/H] $=-1.55$ and is s-process enriched. We find that HD 55496 presents four chemical peculiarities: (i) a Na-O abundance anti-correlation; (ii) it is aluminum rich; (iii) it is carbon poor for a s-process enriched star and (iv) the heavy 2$^{nd}$ s-process peak elements, such as Ba, La, Ce, and Nd, present smaller abundances than the lighter s-process elements, such as Sr, Y and Zr, which is not usually observed among the chemically-peculiar binary stars at this metallicity. The heavy-element abundance pattern suggests that the main source of the neutrons is the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction. Taken all these abundance evidence together into consideration, this strongly suggests that HD 55496 is a ""second generation of globular cluster star"" formed from gas already strongly enriched in s-process elements and now is a field halo object. Our dynamical analysis, however, indicates that the past encounter probabilities with the known globular clusters is very small ($\leq 6\%$). This evidence, together with the fact of having a retrograde motion, points to a halo intruder possibly originated from the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy.","C. B. Pereira, N. A. Drake, F.

289,"We consider the possibility that dark matter halos are made of quantum particles such as fermions or bosons in the form of Bose-Einstein condensates. In that case, they generically have a ``core-halo'' structure with a quantum core that depends on the type of particle considered and a halo that is relatively independent of the dark matter particle and that is similar to the NFW profile of cold dark matter. We model the halo by an isothermal gas with an effective temperature $T$. We then derive the core mass -- halo mass relation $M_c(M_v)$ of dark matter halos from an effective thermodynamical model by extremizing the free energy $F(M_c)$ with respect to the core mass $M_c$. We obtain a general relation that is equivalent to the ``velocity dispersion tracing'' relation according to which the velocity dispersion in the core $v_c^2\sim GM_c/R_c$ is of the same order as the velocity dispersion in the halo $v_v^2\sim GM_v/r_v$. We provide therefore a justification of this relation from thermodynamical arguments. In the case of fermions, we obtain a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{1/2}$ that agrees with the relation found numerically by Ruffini {\it et al.}. In the case of noninteracting bosons, we obtain a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{1/3}$ that agrees with the relation found numerically by Schive {\it et al.}. In the case of bosons with a repulsive self-interaction in the Thomas-Fermi limit, we predict a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{2/3}$ that still has to be confirmed numerically. We also obtain a general approximate core mass -- halo mass relation that is valid for bosons with arbitrary repulsive or attractive self-interaction. For an attractive self-interaction, we determine the maximum halo mass that can harbor a stable quantum core (dilute axion ``star'').",Pierre-Henri Chavanis,No comment found,1905.08137v1,No journal ref found,Pierre-Henri Chavanis,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08137v1,2019-05-20 14:30:21+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Derivation of the core mass -- halo mass relation of fermionic and   bosonic dark matter halos from an effective thermodynamical model,2019-05-20 14:30:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08137v1

291,"In this work we revisit the issue of the rotation speed of the spiral arms and the location of the corotation radius of our Galaxy. This research was performed using homogeneous data set of young open clusters (age < 50 Myr) determined from Gaia DR2 data. The stellar astrometric membership were determined using proper motions and parallaxes, taking into account the full covariance matrix. The distance, age, reddening and metallicity of the clusters were determined by our non subjective multidimensional global optimization tool to fit theoretical isochrones to Gaia DR2 photometric data. The rotation speed of the arms is obtained from the relation between age and angular distance of the birthplace of the clusters to the present-day position of the arms. Using the clusters belonging to the Sagittarius-Carina, Local and Perseus arms, and adopting the Galactic parameters $R_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $V_0$ = 240 km\,s$^{-1}$, we determine a pattern speed of $28.2 \pm 2.1$ km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$, with no difference between the arms. This implies that the corotation radius is $R_c = 8.51 \pm 0.64$ kpc, close to the solar Galactic orbit ($R_c/R_0 = 1.02\pm0.07$).","Wilton S. Dias, Hektor Monteiro, Jacques R. D. LÃ©pine, Douglas A.

292,"Current observational data of exoplanets are providing increasing detail of their 3D atmospheric structures. As characterisation efforts expand in scope, the need to develop consistent 3D radiative-transfer methods becomes more pertinent as the complex atmospheric properties of exoplanets are required to be modelled together consistently. We aim to compare the transmission and emission spectra results of a 3D Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) model to contemporary radiative-transfer suites. We perform several benchmarking tests of a MCRT code, Cloudy Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (CMCRT), to transmission and emission spectra model output. We add flexibility to the model through the use of k-distribution tables as input opacities. We present a hybrid MCRT and ray tracing methodology for the calculation of transmission spectra with a multiple scattering component. CMCRT compares well to the transmission spectra benchmarks at the 10s of ppm level. Emission spectra benchmarks are consistent to within 10% of the 1D models. We suggest that differences in the benchmark results are likely caused by geometric effects between plane-parallel and spherical models. In a practical application, we post-process a cloudy 3DHD 189733b GCM model and compare to available observational data. Our results suggest the core methodology and algorithms of CMCRT produce consistent results to contemporary radiative transfer suites. 3D MCRT methods are highly suitable for detailed post-processing of cloudy and non-cloudy 1D and 3D exoplanet atmosphere simulations in instances where atmospheric inhomogeneities, significant limb effects/geometry or multiple scattering components are important considerations.","Graham K.

Recently it has been shown that the Schwarzschild star is stable against spherically-symmetric perturbations. Here we study arbitrary axial non-spherical perturbations, and show that the observable quasinormal modes can be as close to the Schwarzschild limit as one wishes, what makes the Schwarzschild star a very good mimicker of a black hole. The decaying time-domain profiles prove that the Schwarzschild star is stable against non-spherical perturbations as well. Another peculiar feature is the absence of echoes at the end of the ringdown. Instead we observe a non-oscillating mode which might belong to the class of algebraically special modes.

In particular, the presence of an external magnetic field can allow for stable anisotropies, implying some departures from the isotropic MHD jumps. The functional dependence of such anisotropies in terms of the field is yet to be determined. By hypothesizing a kinetic history of the plasma through the shock front, we recently devised a theory of the downstream anisotropy, hence of the density jump, in terms of the field strength for a parallel shock [J. Plasma Phys. (2018), vol. 84, 905840604]. Here, we extend the analysis to the case of a perpendicular shock.

298,"The angular momentum of a molecular cloud core plays a key role in star formation, since it is directly related to the outflow and the jet emanating from the new-born star and it eventually results in the formation of the protoplanetary disk. However, the origin of the core rotation and its time evolution are not well understood. Recent observations reveal that molecular clouds exhibit a ubiquity of filamentary structures and that star forming cores are associated with the densest filaments. Since these results suggest that dense cores form primarily in filaments, the mechanism of core formation from filament fragmentation should explain the distribution of the angular momentum of these cores. In this paper we analyze the relation between velocity fluctuations along the filament close to equilibrium and the angular momentum of the cores formed along its crest. We first find that an isotropic velocity fluctuation that follows the three-dimensional Kolmogorov spectrum does not reproduce the observed angular momentum of molecular cloud cores. We then identify the need for a large power at small scales and study the effect of three power spectrum models. We show that the one-dimensional Kolmogorov power spectrum with a slope -5/3 and an anisotropic model with reasonable parameters are compatible with the observations. Our results stress the importance of more detailed and systematic observations of both the velocity structure along filaments and the angular momentum distribution of molecular cloud cores to determine the validity of the mechanism of core formation from filamentary molecular clouds.","Yoshiaki Misugi, Shu-ichiro Inutsuka, Doris Arzoumanian","20 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

299,"Continuum spectrum emitted by the accretion disk around quasars hold a wealth of information regarding the strong gravitational field produced by the massive central object. Such strong gravity regime is often expected to exhibit deviations from general relativity (GR) which may manifest through the presence of extra dimensions. Higher dimensions, which serve as the corner stone for string theory and M-theory can act as promising alternatives to dark matter and dark energy with interesting implications in inflationary cosmology, gravitational waves and collider physics. Therefore it is instructive to investigate the effect of more than four spacetime dimensions on the black hole continuum spectrum which provide an effective astrophysical probe to the strong gravity regime. To explore such a scenario, we compute the optical luminosity emitted by a thin accretion disk around a rotating supermassive black hole albeit in the presence of extra dimensions. The background metric resembles the Kerr-Newman spacetime in GR where the tidal charge parameter inherited from extra dimensions can also assume negative signature. The theoretical luminosity computed in such a background is contrasted with optical observations of eighty quasars. The difference between the theoretical and observed luminosity for these quasars is used to infer the most favoured choice of the rotation parameter for each quasar and the tidal charge parameter. This has been achieved by minimizing/maximizing several error estimators, e.g., chi-squared, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement etc. Intriguingly, all of them favour a negative value for the tidal charge parameter, a characteristic signature of extra dimensions. Thus accretion disk does provide a significant possibility of exploring the existence of extra dimensions through its close correspondence with the strong gravity regime.","Indrani Banerjee, Sumanta Chakraborty, Soumitra SenGupta","31 pages, 4 figures, 1 Table",1905.08043v1,No journal ref found,Soumitra SenGupta,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08043v1,2019-05-20 12:35:24+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Decoding signatures of extra dimensions and estimating spin of quasars   from the continuum spectrum,2019-05-20 12:35:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08043v1
300,"We aim to investigate the impact of the ionized radiation from the M16 HII region on the surrounding molecular cloud and on its hosted star formation. To present comprehensive multi-wavelength observations towards the M16 HII region, we used new CO data and existing infrared, optical, and submillimeter data. The 12CO J=1-0, 13CO J=1-0, and C18O J=1-0 data were obtained with the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7m radio telescope. To trace massive clumps and extract young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the M16 HII region, we used the ATLASGAL and GLIMPSE I catalogs, respectively. From CO data, we discern a large-scale filament with three velocity components. Because these three components overlap with each other in both velocity and space, the filament may be made of three layers. The M16 ionized gas interacts with the large-scale filament and has reshaped its structure. In the large-scale filament, we find 51 compact cores from the ATLASGAL catalog, 20 of them being quiescent. The mean excitation temperature of these cores is 22.5 K, while this is 22.2 K for the quiescent cores. This high temperature observed for the quiescent cores suggests that the cores may be heated by M16 and do not experience internal heating from sources in the cores. Through the relationship between the mass and radius of these cores, we obtain that 45% of all the cores are massive enough to potentially form massive stars. Compared with the thermal motion, the turbulence created by the nonthermal motion is responsible for the core formation. For the pillars observed towards M16, the H II region may give rise to the strong turbulence.","Jin-Long Xu, Annie Zavagno, Naiping Yu, Xiao-Lan Liu, Ye Xu, Jinghua Yuan, Chuan-Peng Zhang, Si-Ju Zhang, Guo-Yin Zhang, Chang-Chun Ning, Bing-Gang Ju","18 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",1905.08030v1,No journal ref found,Bing-Gang Ju,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08030v1,2019-05-20 12:25:49+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.GA,The effects of ionization feedback on star formation: A case study of   the M16 H II region,2019-05-20 12:25:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08030v1
301,"Sunspot observations in chromospheric spectral lines have revealed the existence of short-lived linear bright transients, commonly referred to as penumbral micro-jets (PMJs). Details on the origin and physical nature of PMJs are to large extend still unkown. We aim to characterize the dynamical nature of PMJs to provide guidance for future modelling efforts. We analyze high spatial (0.1 arcsec) and temporal resolution (1 s) Ca II H filtergram (0.1 nm bandwidth) observations of a sunspot obtained on two consecutive days with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We find that PMJs appear to be the rapid brightening of an already existing (faint) fibril. The rapid brightening is the fast increase (typically less than 10 s) in intensity over significant length (several 100s of km) of the existing fibril. For most PMJs, we cannot identify a clear root or source from where the brightening appears to originate. After the fast onset, about half of the PMJs have a top that is moving with an apparent velocity between 5 and 14 km/s, most of them upwards. For the other PMJs, there is no significant motion of the top. For about a third of the PMJs we observe a splitting into two parallel and co-evolving linear features during the later phases of the lifetime of the PMJ. We conclude that mass flows can play only limited role in the onset phase of PMJs and that it is more likely that we see the effect of a fast heating front.","Luc Rouppe van der Voort, Ainar Drews","Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

302,"Although knowing the occurrence frequency of severe space weather events is important for a modern society, it is insufficiently known due to the lack of magnetic or sunspot observations, before the Carrington event in 1859 known as one of the largest events during the last two centuries. Here, we show that a severe magnetic storm occurred on 8 March 1582 based on auroral records in East Asia. The equatorward boundary of auroral visibility reached 28.8{\deg} magnetic latitude. The equatorward boundary of the auroral oval is estimated to be 33.0{\deg} invariant latitude (ILAT), which is comparable to the storms on 25/26 September 1909 (~31.6{\deg} ILAT, minimum Dst of -595 nT), 28/29 August 1859 (~36.5{\deg} ILAT), and 13/14 March 1989 (~40{\deg} ILAT, minimum Dst of -589 nT). Assuming that the equatorward boundary is a proxy for the scale of magnetic storms, we presume that the storm on March 1582 was severe. We also found that the storm on March 1582 lasted, at least, for three days by combining European records. The auroral oval stayed at mid-latitude for the first two days and moved to low-latitude (in East Asia) for the last day. It is plausible that the storm was caused by a series of ICMEs (interplanetary coronal mass ejections). We can reasonably speculate that a first ICME could have cleaned up interplanetary space to make the following ICMEs more geo-effective, as probably occurred in the Carrington and Halloween storms.","Kentaro Hattori, Hisashi Hayakawa, Yusuke Ebihara","Accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal

We performed time series photometry of NGC 4147 in V and R bands, and identified 42 periodic variables in the region of NGC 4147, 28 of which have been detected for the first time. Seventeen variable stars are located within the half light radius $\lesssim$ 0.48 arcmin, of which 10 stars are newly identified variables. Two of 10 variables are located within the core radius $\lesssim$ 0.09 arcmin. Based on the location in the $V/(V-R)$ colour magnitude diagram and variability characteristics, 7, 8, 5 and 1 newly identified probable member variables are classified as RRc, EA/E, EW and SX Phe, respectively. The metallicity of NGC 4147 estimated from light curves of RRab and RRc stars with the help of Fourier decomposition is found to be characteristics of Oosterhoff II.

305,"Some publications indicate that poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) exhibit low levels of photoluminesence (fluorescence and/or phosphorescence) when irradiated with photons in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible range. PMMA (also known as acrylic) and PTFE are commonly used to contain the liquid argon (LAr) or xenon (LXe) target material in rare-event search experiments. LAr and LXe scintillate in the vacuum UV region, and the PMMA and PTFE can be directly illuminated by these photons. Photoluminescence from support materials could cause unexpected signals in these detectors.   We investigate photoluminesence in the 400 nm to 550 nm region in response to excitation with UV light between 130 nm and 250 nm at levels relevant to rare-event search experiments. Measurements are done at room temperature and the signal intensity is time-integrated over several minutes.   We tested PMMA and PTFE samples from the batches used in the DEAP-3600 and LUX experiments and observed no photoluminescence signal.

306,"The arrival directions of cosmic rays detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) with energies above 39~EeV were recently reported to correlate with the positions of 23 nearby starburst galaxies (SBGs): in their best-fit model, 9.7\% of the cosmic-ray flux originates from these objects and undergoes angular diffusion on a $12.9^\circ$~scale. On the other hand, some of the SBGs on their list, including the brightest one (M82), are at northern declinations outside the Auger field of view. Data from detectors in the northern hemisphere would be needed to look for cosmic-ray excesses near these objects. In this work, we tested the Auger best-fit model against data collected by the Telescope Array (TA) in a 9-year period, without trying to re-optimize the model parameters for our dataset in order not to introduce statistical penalties. The resulting test statistic (double log-likelihood ratio) was $-1.00$, corresponding to $1.1\sigma$ significance among isotropically generated random datasets, and to $-1.4\sigma$ significance among ones generated assuming the Auger best-fit model. In other words, our data is still insufficient to conclusively rule out either hypothesis. The ongoing fourfold expansion of TA will collect northern hemisphere data with much more statistics, improving our ability to discriminate between different flux models.","Armando di Matteo, Toshihiro Fujii, Kazumasa Kawata","3 pages, 4 figures; presented at the UHECR2018 conference, 8-12

307,"We propose a method to probe the homogeneity of a general universe, without assuming symmetry. We show that isotropy can be tested at remote locations on the past lightcone by comparing the line-of-sight and transverse expansion rates, using the time dependence of the polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background photons that have been inverse-Compton scattered by the hot gas in massive clusters of galaxies. This probes a combination of remote transverse and parallel components of the expansion rate of the metric, and we may use radial baryon acoustic oscillations or cosmic clocks to measure the parallel expansion rate. Thus we can test remote isotropy, which is a key requirement of a homogeneous universe. We provide explicit formulas that connect observables and properties of the metric.","Raul Jimenez, Roy Maartens, Ali Rida Khalifeh, Robert R. Caldwell, Alan F.

308,"In the previous paper [Harada, Cardoso, and Miyata, Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 99} (2019), 044039], it is shown that a hollow transmissive shell collapsing to an ultracompact object of radius very close to its horizon radius generally emits transient Hawking radiation followed by a couple of bursts separated each other by a long time interval. In the current paper, we expand the previous work in two independent directions: changing boundary conditions and specifying the equations of state of the matter. First, we introduce a perfectly reflective surface collapsing to an ultracompact object and find that this model also emits transient Hawking radiation that is followed only by a single burst. Second, we introduce two different collapse dynamics to an ultracompact object and specify the corresponding matter equations of state. We find that transient Hawking radiation is quite commonly seen in early times, while the subsequent bursts strongly depend on the boundary condition and the equation of state or the braking behavior of the surface.","Takafumi Kokubu, Tomohiro Harada","30 pages, 30 figures",1905.07981v1,No journal ref found,Tomohiro Harada,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07981v1,2019-05-20 10:39:57+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE|hep-th,Burst particle creation in gravitational collapse to a horizonless   compact object,2019-05-20 10:39:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07981v1
309,"Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) represent the most prominent population of Galactic very-high-energy gamma-ray sources and are thought to be an efficient source of leptonic cosmic rays. Vela X is a nearby middle-aged PWN, which shows bright X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission toward an elongated structure called the cocoon. Since TeV emission is likely inverse-Compton emission of electrons while X-ray emission is synchrotron radiation of the same electrons, we aim to derive the properties of the relativistic particles and of magnetic fields with minimal modelling. We use data from the Suzaku XIS to derive the spectra from three compact regions in Vela X covering distances from 0.3 pc to 4 pc from the pulsar along the cocoon. We obtain gamma-ray spectra of the same regions from H.E.S.S. observations and fit a radiative model to the multi-wavelength spectra. The TeV electron spectra and magnetic field strengths are consistent within the uncertainties for the three regions, with energy densities of the order $10^{-12}\rm\,erg\,cm^{-3}$. The data indicate the presence of a cutoff in the electron spectrum at energies of $\sim$100 TeV and a magnetic field strength of $\sim$$6\,\rm\mu G$. Constraints on the presence of turbulent magnetic fields are weak. The pressure of TeV electrons and magnetic fields in the cocoon is dynamically negligible, requiring the presence of another dominant pressure component. Sub-TeV electrons cannot account completely for the missing pressure, that may be provided either by relativistic ions or from mixing of the ejecta with the pulsar wind. The electron spectra are consistent with expectations from transport scenarios dominated either by advection via the reverse shock or by diffusion. Constraints on turbulent magnetic fields and the shape of the electron cutoff can be improved by spectral measurements in the energy range $\gtrsim 10\rm\,keV$. (abridged)",H. E. S. S.

310,"Numerical integration of orbit trajectories for a large number of initial conditions and for long time spans is computationally expensive. Semi-analytical methods were developed to reduce the computational burden. An elegant and widely used method of semi-analytically integrating trajectories of objects subject to atmospheric drag was proposed by King-Hele (KH). However, the analytical KH contraction method relies on the assumption that the atmosphere density decays strictly exponentially with altitude. If the actual density profile does not satisfy the assumption of a fixed scale height, as is the case for Earth's atmosphere, the KH method introduces potentially large errors for non-circular orbit configurations.   In this work, the KH method is extended to account for such errors by using a newly introduced atmosphere model derivative. By superimposing exponentially decaying partial atmospheres, the superimposed KH method can be applied accurately while considering more complex density profiles. The KH method is further refined by deriving higher order terms during the series expansion. A variable boundary condition to choose the appropriate eccentricity regime, based on the series truncation errors, is introduced. The accuracy of the extended analytical contraction method is shown to be comparable to numerical Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Propagation using the proposed method compares well against non-averaged integration of the dynamics, while the computational load remains very low.","Stefan Frey, Camilla Colombo, Stijn Lemmens",Post-print version of 13 February 2019,1905.07972v1,No journal ref found,Stijn Lemmens,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07972v1,2019-05-20 10:19:05+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,"Extension of the King-Hele orbit contraction method for accurate,   semi-analytical propagation of non-circular orbits",2019-05-20 10:19:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07972v1

The photometric light curves were fitted to provide fundamental parameters, required to use in the analysis of evolutionary stages of the binary. The results show that V2790~Ori is a W-type contact system with a mass ratio of $q$~=~2.932. The orbital period increase is found at a rate of $\mathrm{d}P\slash \mathrm{d}t~=~$1.03$\times10^{-7}~$d~yr$^{-1}$. It implies that a rate of mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary one is $\mathrm{d}m_2\slash \mathrm{d}t~=~$6.31$\times10^{-8}~M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we find that from the detached phase to the contact phase, mass of the evolved secondary component has been lost 1.188$\pm$0.110~$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, i.e., mass lost by the system of 0.789$\pm$0.073~$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and mass transfer to the primary of 0.399$\pm$0.037~$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.

312,"We study the chemical evolution of H2O:CO:NH3 ice mixtures irradiated with soft X-rays, in the range 250-1250 eV. We identify many nitrogen-bearing molecules such as e.g., OCN-, NH4+ , HNCO, CH3CN, HCONH2, and NH2COCONH2. Several infrared features are compatible with glycine or its isomers. During the irradiation, we detected through mass spectroscopy many species desorbing the ice. Such findings support either the infrared identifications and reveal less abundant species with not clear infrared features. Among them, m/z = 57 has been ascribed to methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO), a molecule of prebiotic relevance, recently detected in protostellar environments. During the warm up after the irradiation, several infrared features including 2168 cm-1 band of OCN-, 1690 cm-1 band of formamide, and the 1590 cm-1 band associated to three different species, HCOO-, CH3NH2 and NH3+CH2COO survive up to room temperature. Interestingly, many high masses have been also detected. Possible candidates are methyl-formate, (m/z = 60, HCOOCH3), ethanediamide (m/z = 88, NH2COCONH2), and N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (m=z = 175). This latter species is compatible with the presence of the m/z = 43, 70 and 80 fragments. Photo-desorption of organics is relevant for the detection of such species in the gas-phase of cold environments, where organic synthesis in ice mantles should dominate. We estimate the gas-phase enrichment of some selected species in the light of a protoplanetary disc model around young solar-type stars.","A. Ciaravella, A. JimÃ©nez-Escobar, C.

313,"We derive cosmological constraints using a galaxy cluster sample selected from the 2500~deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey. The sample spans the redshift range $0.25< z<1.75$ and contains 343 clusters with SZ detection significance $\xi>5$. The sample is supplemented with optical weak gravitational lensing measurements of 32 clusters with $0.29<z<1.13$ (from Magellan and HST) and X-ray measurements of 89 clusters with $0.25<z<1.75$ (from Chandra). We rely on minimal modeling assumptions: i) weak lensing provides an accurate means of measuring halo masses, ii) the mean SZ and X-ray observables are related to the true halo mass through power-law relations in mass and dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$ with a-priori unknown parameters, iii) there is (correlated, lognormal) intrinsic scatter and measurement noise relating these observables to their mean relations. We simultaneously fit for these astrophysical modeling parameters and for cosmology. Assuming a flat $\nu\Lambda$CDM model, in which the sum of neutrino masses is a free parameter, we measure $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.276\pm0.047$, $\sigma_8=0.781\pm0.037$, and $\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.2}=0.766\pm0.025$. The redshift evolution of the X-ray $Y_\mathrm{X}$-mass and $M_\mathrm{gas}$-mass relations are both consistent with self-similar evolution to within $1\sigma$. The mass-slope of the $Y_\mathrm{X}$-mass relation shows a $2.3\sigma$ deviation from self-similarity. Similarly, the mass-slope of the $M_\mathrm{gas}$-mass relation is steeper than self-similarity at the $2.5\sigma$ level. In a $\nu w$CDM cosmology, we measure the dark energy equation of state parameter $w=-1.55\pm0.41$ from the cluster data. We perform a measurement of the growth of structure since redshift $z\sim1.7$ and find no evidence for tension with the prediction from General Relativity.

314,"We have performed a census of the UV-bright population in 78 globular clusters using wide-field UV telescopes. This population includes a variety of phases of post-horizontal branch (HB) evolution, including hot post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-early AGB stars. There are indications that old stellar systems like globular clusters produce fewer post-(early) AGB stars than currently predicted by evolutionary models, but observations are still scarce. We obtained FORS2 spectroscopy of eleven of these UV-selected objects (covering a range of -2.3<[Fe/H]<-1.0), which we (re-)analysed together with previously observed data. We used model atmospheres of different metallicities, including super-solar ones. Where possible, we verified our atmospheric parameters using UV spectrophotometry and searched for metal lines in the optical spectra. We calculated evolutionary sequences for four metallicity regimes and used them together with information about the HB morphology of the globular clusters to estimate the expected numbers of post-AGB stars. Seven of the eleven new luminous UV-bright stars are post-AGB or post-early AGB stars, two are evolving away from the HB, one is a foreground white dwarf, and one is a white dwarf merger. So spectroscopy is clearly required to identify the evolutionary status of hot UV-bright stars. For hotter stars, metal-rich model spectra are required to reproduce their optical and UV spectra, which may affect the flux contribution of hot post-AGB stars to the UV spectra of evolved populations. Adding published information on other hot UV-bright stars in globular clusters, we find that the number of observed hot post-AGB stars generally agrees with the predicted values, although the numbers are still low.","S.

315,"A survey of molecular cores covering the infrared dark cloud known as the M17 southwest extension (M17 SWex) has been carried out with the 45 m Nobeyama Radio Telescope. Based on the N2H+ (J= 1-0) data obtained, we have identified 46 individual cores whose masses are in the range 43 to 3026 Mo. We examined the relationship between the physical parameters of the cores and those of young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the cores found in the literature. The comparison of the virial mass and the core mass indicates that most of the cores can be gravitationally stable if we assume a large external pressure. Among the 46 cores, we found four massive cores with YSOs. They have large mass of >~ 1000Mo and line width of >~ 2.5 km s^-1 which are similar to those of clumps forming high mass stars. However, previous studies have shown that there is no active massive star formation in this region. Recent measurements of near-infrared polarization infer that the magnetic field around M17 SWex is likely to be strong enough to support the cores against self-gravity. We therefore suggest that the magnetic field may prevent the cores from collapsing, causing the low-level of massive star formation in M17 SWex.","Tomomi Shimoikura, Kazuhito Dobashi, Asha Hirose, Fumitaka Nakamura, Yoshito Shimajiri, Koji Sugitani","12 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Publications of the

316,"Even if Dark Matter (DM) is neutral under electromagnetism, it can still interact with the Standard Model (SM) via photon exchange from higher-dimensional operators. Here we classify the general effective operators coupling DM to photons, distinguishing between Dirac/Majorana fermion and complex/real scalar DM. We provide model-independent constraints on these operators from direct and indirect detection. We also constrain various DM-lepton operators, which induce DM-photon interactions via RG running or which typically arise in sensible UV-completions. This provides a simple way to quickly assess constraints on any DM model that interacts mainly via photon exchange or couples to SM leptons.","Bradley J.

317,"A plateau phase in the X-ray afterglow is observed in a significant fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previously, it has been found that there exists a correlation among three key parameters concerning the plateau phase, i.e., the end time of the plateau phase in the GRB rest frame ($T_{a}$), the corresponding X-ray luminosity at the end time ($L_{X}$) and the isotropic energy of the prompt GRB ($E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$). In this study, we systematically search through all the \emph{Swift} GRBs with a plateau phase that occurred between 2005 May and 2018 August. We collect 174 GRBs, with redshifts available for all of them. For the whole sample, the correlation between $L_{X}$, $T_{a}$ and $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$ is confirmed, with the best fit relation being $L_{X}\propto T_{a}^{-0.92}E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}^{0.83}$. Such an updated three-parameter correlation still supports that the central leftover after GRBs is probably a millisecond magnetar. It is interesting to note that short GRBs with duration less than 2 s in our sample also follow the same correlation, which hints that the merger production of two neutron stars could be a high mass magnetar, but not necessarily a black hole. Moreover, GRBs having an ``internal'' plateau (i.e., with a following decay index being generally smaller than -3) also obey this correlation. It further strengthens the idea that the internal plateau is due to the delayed collapse of a high mass neutron star into a black hole. The updated three-parameter correlation indicates that GRBs with a plateau phase may act as a standard candle for cosmology study.","C. H. Tang, Y. F. Huang, J. J. Geng, Z. B.

318,"A method is presented to limit the volumetric density of repeating fast radio bursts based on the number (or lack) of repeating bursts identified in a survey. The method incorporates the instantaneous sensitivity of the instrument, its beam pattern, and the dwell time per pointing, as well as the energy and timing distribution of repeat bursts. Applied to the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder's (ASKAP's) Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) `lat50' survey, the presence of an FRB similar to FRB 121102 is excluded within a volume of $1.9 \cdot 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ at 95% confidence level (C.L.). Assuming a burst energy cut-off at $10^{42}$ erg, the 95% C.L. upper limit on the population density of repeating FRBs in the current epoch is $27$ Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming isotropic (unbeamed) emission. This number is much lower than expected from even rare scenarios such as magnetar formation in gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the maximally allowed population under-predicts the observed number of single bursts in the survey. Comparisons with the observed dispersion measure distribution favours a larger population of less rapidly repeating objects, or the existence of a second population of non-repeating FRBs.

319,"Hadronic inhomogeneities are formed after the quark hadron phase transition. The nature of the phase transition dictates the nature of the inhomogeneities formed. Recently some scenarios of inhomogeneities have been discussed where the strange quarks are in excess over the up and down quarks. The hadronization of these quarks will give rise to a large density of hyperons and kaons in addition to the protons and neutrons which are formed after the phase transition. These unstable hyperons decay into pions, muons and their respective neutrinos. Hence the plasma during this period consists of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons and neutrinos. Due to the decay of the hyperons, the muon component of the inhomogeneities will be very high. We study the diffusion of neutrons and protons in the presence of a large number of muons immediately after the quark hadron phase transition. We find that the presence of the muons enhances the diffusion coefficient of the neutrons/protons. As the diffusion coefficient is enhanced, the inhomogeneities will decay faster in the regions where the muon density is higher. Hence smaller muon rich inhomogeneities will be completely wiped out. The decay of the hyperons will also generate muon neutrinos. Since the big bang nucleosynthesis provides constraints on the neutrino degeneracies, we revisit the effect of non zero degeneracies on the primordial elements.","Sovan Sau, Sayantan Bhattacharya, Soma Sanyal","20 pages 7 figures Revised version accepted for publication in

320,"Empirical correlations between stellar parameters such as rotation or radius and magnetic activity diagnostics require estimates of the effective temperatures and the stellar radii. The aim of this study is to propose simple methods that can be applied to large samples of stars in order to derive estimates of the stellar parameters.   Good empirical correlations between Red/Infra-Red colours (e.g. (R-I)$_C$) and effective temperatures have been well established for a long time (e.g. Veeder 1974, Bessell 1979, Leggett 1992). The more recent (R-I)$_C$ colour-$T_{eff}$ correlation using the data of Mann et al. (2015: hereafter M15) and Boyajian et al. (2012: hereafter B12) shows that this colour can be applied as a temperature estimate for large samples of stars. We find that the mean scatter in $T_{eff}$ relative to the (R-I)$_C$-$T_{eff}$ relationship of B12 and M15 data is only $\pm 3\sigma =$44.6~K for K dwarfs and $\pm 3\sigma =$39.4~K for M dwarfs. These figures are small and show that the (R-I)$_C$ colour can be used as a first guess effective temperature estimator for K and M dwarfs.   We derive effective temperatures for about 1910 K and M dwarfs using the calibration of (R-I)$_C$ colour-$T_{eff}$ from B12 and M15 data. We also compiled $T_{eff}$ and metallicity measurements available in the literature using the VizieR database.   We determine $T_{eff}$ for 441 stars with previously unknown effective temperatures. We also identified 21 new spectroscopic binaries and 1 triple system from our high resolution spectra.","Eric R. Houdebine, D. J. Mullan, J. G. Doyle, Geoffroy de La Vieuville, C. J. Butler, F.

323,"A mass of galaxy cluster is commonly defined by a spherical over-density (SO) mass with respect to a reference density, whereas the time evolution of SO mass can be affected by redshift evolution of the reference density, as well as physical mass accretion around galaxy clusters. In this paper, we directly measure the amount of pseudo evolution of a SO mass of cluster-sized dark matter halo by the change of reference density from time series of $N$-body simulation for the first time. We find that $48\pm14\%$ of difference in virial SO mass between $z=0$ and $1$ is accounted by the pseudo evolution for clusters with virial mass of $10^{14}\, h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$. The amount of pseudo evolution of SO mass is found to be correlated with the age and the density environment of galaxy cluster. Stacked mass density profile of cluster-sized halos with a larger amount of pseudo evolution of SO mass shows higher concentration ${\it and}$ larger linear bias parameter, that is a counter-example of known secondary halo bias due to concentration on cluster scales. We discuss how more concentrated clusters can have a larger clustering amplitude than less concentrated counterparts and argue the presence of rich filamentary structures plays a critical role in determining the linear halo bias of galaxy clusters.",Masato Shirasaki,"13 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

324,"We report the detection of an excess in dust continuum emission at 233~GHz (1.3~mm in wavelength) in the protoplanetary disk around TW~Hya revealed through high-sensitivity observations at $\sim$3~au resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The sensitivity of the 233~GHz image has been improved by a factor of 3 with regard to that of our previous cycle 3 observations. The overall structure is mostly axisymmetric, and there are apparent gaps at 25 and 41 au as previously reported. The most remarkable new finding is a few au-scale excess emission in the south-west part of the protoplanetary disk. The excess emission is located at 52 au from the disk center and is 1.5 times brighter than the surrounding protoplanetary disk at a significance of 12$\sigma$. We performed a visibility fitting to the extracted emission after subtracting the axisymmetric protoplanetary disk emission and found that the inferred size and the total flux density of the excess emission are 4.4$\times$1.0~au and 250~$\mu$Jy, respectively. The dust mass of the excess emission corresponds to 0.03~$M_\oplus$ if a dust temperature of 18~K is assumed. Since the excess emission can also be marginally identified in the Band 7 image at almost the same position, the feature is unlikely to be a background source. The excess emission can be explained by a dust clump accumulated in a small elongated vortex or a massive circumplanetary disk around a Neptune mass forming-planet.","Takashi Tsukagoshi, Takayuki Muto, Hideko Nomura, Ryohei Kawabe, Kazuhiro D.

325,"We present an analysis of the chemical abundances and kinematics of six low-mass dwarf stars, previously claimed to be candidate hypervelocity stars (HVSs). We obtained moderate-resolution ($R\sim$ 6000) spectra of these stars to estimate their abundances of several chemical elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni), and derived their space velocity components and orbital parameters using proper motions from \gaia\ Data Release 2. All six stars are shown to be bound to the Milky Way, and in fact are not even considered high-velocity stars with respect to the Galactic rest frame. Nevertheless, we attempt to characterize their parent Galactic stellar components by simultaneously comparing their abundance patterns and orbital parameters with those expected from various Galactic stellar components. We find that two of our program stars are typical disk stars. For four of the program stars, even though their kinematic probabilistic membership assignment suggests membership in the Galactic disk, based on their distinct orbital properties and chemical characteristics, we cannot rule out the exotic origins of these objects, as follows. Two stars appear to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. One program star has possibly been accreted from a disrupted dwarf galaxy or dynamically heated from a birthplace in the Galactic bulge. The last object may be either a runaway disk star or has been dynamically heated. Spectroscopic follow-up observations with higher resolution for these curious objects will provide a better understanding of their origin.","Bum-Suk Yeom, Young Sun Lee, Jae-Rim Koo, Timothy C.

326,"The Hitomi results on the Perseus cluster lead to improvements in our knowledge of atomic physics which are crucial for the precise diagnostic of hot astrophysical plasma observed with high-resolution X-ray spectrometers. However, modeling uncertainties remain, both within but especially beyond Hitomi's spectral window. A major challenge in spectral modeling is the Fe-L spectrum, which is basically a complex assembly of n>2 to n=2 transitions of Fe ions in different ionization states, affected by a range of atomic processes such as collisional excitation, resonant excitation, radiative recombination, dielectronic recombination, and innershell ionization. In this paper we perform a large-scale theoretical calculation on each of the processes with the flexible atomic code (FAC), focusing on ions of Fe XVII to Fe XXIV that form the main body of the Fe-L complex. The new data are found to be consistent within 20% with the recent individual R-matrix calculations for the main Fe-L lines. By further testing the new FAC calculations with the high-quality RGS data from 15 elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters, we note that the new model gives systematically better fits than the current SPEX v3.04 code, and the mean Fe abundance decreases by 12%, while the O/Fe ratio increases by 16% compared with the results from the current code. Comparing the FAC fit results to those with the R-matrix calculations, we find a temperature-dependent discrepancy of up to ~10% on the Fe abundance between the two theoretical models. Further dedicated tests with both observed spectra and targeted laboratory measurements are needed to resolve the discrepancies, and ultimately, to get the atomic data ready for the next high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy mission.","Liyi Gu, A.

327,"Energetic feedback from star clusters plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamical evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To study the effects of stellar feedback on the star formation efficiency of the clouds and the dynamical response of embedded star clusters, we perform a suite of isolated GMC simulations with star formation and momentum feedback subgrid models using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \textsc{Arepo}. The properties of our simulated GMCs span a wide range of initial mass, radius, and velocity configurations. We find that the ratio of the final stellar mass to the total cloud mass, $\epsilon_{\rm int}$, scales strongly with the initial cloud surface density and momentum feedback strength. This correlation is explained by an analytic model that considers force balancing between gravity and momentum feedback. For all simulated GMCs, the stellar density profiles are systematically steeper than that of the gas at the epochs of the peaks of star formation, suggesting a centrally concentrated stellar distribution. We also find that star clusters are always in a sub-virial state with a virial parameter $\sim0.6$ prior to gas expulsion. Both the sub-virial dynamical state and steeper stellar density profiles prevent clusters from dispersal during the gas removal phase of their evolution. The final cluster bound fraction is a continuously increasing function of $\epsilon_{\rm int}$. GMCs with star formation efficiency smaller than 0.5 are still able to form clusters with large bound fractions.","Hui Li, Mark Vogelsberger, Federico Marinacci, Oleg Y.

328,"In previous papers of this series, we developed a new algorithm for modeling the formation of star clusters in galaxy formation simulations. Here we investigate how dissolution of bound star clusters affects the shape of the cluster mass function and the metallicity distribution of surviving clusters. Cluster evolution includes the loss of stars that become unbound due to tidal disruption as well as mass-loss due to stellar evolution. We calculate the tidal tensor along cluster trajectories and use it to estimate the instantaneous mass-loss rate. The typical tidal tensor exhibits large variations on a time-scale of $\sim100$~Myr, with maximum eigenvalue of $10^7$~Gyr$^{-2}$, and median value of $10^4$~Gyr$^{-2}$ for the first Gyr after cluster formation. As a result of dynamical disruption, at the final available output of our simulations at redshift $z\approx1.5$, the cluster mass function has an approximately log-normal shape peaked at $\sim10^{4.3}M_\odot$. Extrapolation of the disruption to $z=0$ results in too many low-mass clusters compared to the observed Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Over 70\% of GC candidates are completely disrupted before the present; only 10\% of the total GC candidate mass remains in surviving clusters. The total mass of surviving clusters at $z=0$ varies from run to run in the range $(2-6)\times10^7M_\odot$, consistent with the observed mass of GC systems in Milky Way-sized galaxies. The metallicity distributions of all massive star clusters and of the surviving GCs have similar shapes but different normalization because of cluster disruption. The model produces a larger fraction of very metal-poor clusters than observed. A robust prediction of the model is the age-metallicity relation, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically younger than metal-poor clusters by up to 3~Gyr.","Hui Li, Oleg Y.

329,"The presence of short-lived ($\sim$\,Myr) radioactive isotopes in meteoritic inclusions at the time of their formation represents a unique opportunity to study the circumstances that led to the formation of the Solar System. To interpret these observations we need to calculate the evolution of radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios in the Galaxy. We present an extension of the open-source galactic chemical evolution codes NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE that enables to track the decay of radioactive isotopes in the interstellar medium. We show how the evolution of isotopic ratio depends on the star formation history and efficiency, star-to-gas mass ratio, and galactic outflows. Given the uncertainties in the observations used to calibrate our model, our predictions for isotopic ratios at the time of formation of the Sun are uncertain by a factor of 3.6. At that time, to recover the actual radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios predicted by our model, one can multiply the steady-state solution (see Equation~1) by $2.3^{+3.4}_{-0.7}$. However, in the cases where the radioactive isotope has a half-life longer than $\sim$\,200\,Myr, or the target radioactive or stable isotopes have mass- and/or metallicity-depended production rates, or they originate from different sources with different delay-time distributions, or the reference isotope is radioactive, our codes should be used for more accurate solutions. Our preliminary calculations confirm the dichotomy between radioactive nuclei in the early Solar System with $r$- and $s$-process origin, and that $^{55}$Mn and $^{60}$Fe can be explained by galactic chemical evolution, while $^{26}$Al cannot.","Benoit CÃ´tÃ©, Maria Lugaro, Rene Reifarth, Marco Pignatari, Blanka VilÃ¡gos, AndrÃ©s YagÃ¼e, Brad K.

331,"Based on the cosmic shear data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), Kilbinger et al. (2013) obtained a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations of $\sigma_8({\Omega_\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.6}=0.79\pm0.03$ from the two-point correlation function (2PCF). This is $\approx3\sigma$ lower than the value $0.89\pm0.01$ derived from Planck data on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. On the other hand, based on the same CFHTLenS data, but using the power spectrum, and performing a different analysis, Liu et al. (2015) obtained the higher value of $\sigma_8({\Omega_\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.64}=0.87^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. We here investigate the origin of this difference, by performing a fair side-by-side comparison of the 2PCF and power spectrum analyses on CFHTLenS data. We find that these two statistics indeed deliver different results, even when applied to the same data in an otherwise identical procedure. We identify excess power in the data on small scales ($\ell>5,000$) driving the larger values inferred from the power spectrum.

332,"Context. The details of the spectral profiles of extreme UV emission lines from solar active regions contain key information to investigate the structure, dynamics, and energetics of the solar upper atmosphere. Aims. We characterize the line profiles not only through the Doppler shift and intensity of the bulk part of the profile. More importantly, we investigate the excess emission and asymmetries in the line wings to study twisting motions and helicity. Methods. WeusearasterscanoftheInterfaceRegionImagingSpectrograph(IRIS)inanactive region. We concentrate on the Si iv line at 1394 {\AA} that forms just below 0.1 MK and follow the plasma in a cool loop moving from one footpoint to the other. We apply single-Gaussian fits to the line core, determine the excess emission in the red and blue wings, and derive the red-blue line asymmetry. Results. The blue wing excess at one footpoint shows injection of plasma into the loop that is then flowing to the other side. At the same footpoint, redshifts of the line core indicate that energy is deposited at around 0.1 MK. The enhanced pressure would then push down the cool plasma and inject some plasma into the loop. In the middle part of the loop, the spectral tilts of the line profiles indicate the presence of a helical structure of the magnetic field, and the line wings are symmetrically enhanced. This is an indication that the loop is driven through the injection of helicity at the loop feet. Conclusions. Iftheloopisdriventobehelical,thenonecanexpectthatthemagneticfieldwill be in a turbulent state, as it has been shown by existing MHD models. The turbulent motions could provide an explanation of the (symmetric) line wing enhancements which have been seen also in loops at coronal temperatures, but have not been understood so far.","Leping Li, Hardi Peter","26 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A",1905.07800v1,No journal ref found,Hardi Peter,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07800v1,2019-05-19 19:55:01+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Plasma injection into a solar coronal loop,2019-05-19 19:55:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07800v1
333,"The current progress in the detection of terrestrial type exoplanets has opened a new avenue in the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and in the search for biosignatures of life with the upcoming ground-based and space missions. To specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and sustainment of life as we know it in other worlds, we need to understand the nature of astrospheric, atmospheric and surface environments of exoplanets in habitable zones around G-K-M dwarfs including our young Sun. Global environment is formed by propagated disturbances from the planet-hosting stars in the form of stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and winds collectively known as astrospheric space weather. Its characterization will help in understanding how an exoplanetary ecosystem interacts with its host star, as well as in the specification of the physical, chemical and biochemical conditions that can create favorable and/or detrimental conditions for planetary climate and habitability along with evolution of planetary internal dynamics over geological timescales. A key linkage of (astro) physical, chemical, and geological processes can only be understood in the framework of interdisciplinary studies with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary and Earth sciences. The assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets will significantly expand the current definition of the habitable zone to the biogenic zone and provide new observational strategies for searching for signatures of life. The major goal of this paper is to describe and discuss the current status and recent progress in this interdisciplinary field and to provide a new roadmap for the future development of the emerging field of exoplanetary science and astrobiology.","V.

334,"Constraining the parameters of physical models with $>5-10$ parameters is a widespread problem in fields like particle physics and astronomy. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by the use of active learning. We illustrate this with examples from high energy physics, a field where computationally expensive simulations and large parameter spaces are common. We show that the active learning techniques query-by-committee and query-by-dropout-committee allow for the identification of model points in interesting regions of high-dimensional parameter spaces (e.g. around decision boundaries). This makes it possible to constrain model parameters more efficiently than is currently done with the most common sampling algorithms.

335,"Context: The chromospheric anemone microflares (AMF) are an interesting kind of the transient solar phenomena where the emission regions have a multi-ribbon configuration, as distinct from the ordinary flares usually possessing only two ribbons. The previously reported AMFs had typically three or, less frequently, four ribbons; and it was shown in our recent Letter [Yu.V. Dumin & B.V. Somov, A&A, 623, L4 (2019)] that they can be reasonably described by the so-called GKSS model of magnetic field, involving four magnetic sources with various polarity and arrangement. Aims: An interesting question is if one can see more complex types of AMF (e.g., containing the greater number of the emission ribbons), which might be produced by more elaborated magnetic configurations? Methods: To answer this question, we performed inspection of the large set of the emission patterns in the chromospheric line CaII H recorded by Hinode/SOT and confronted them with the respective magnetograms obtained by SDO/HMI. Results: As follows from our analysis, it is really possible to identify the new types of AMF, which have not been reported in the previous literature. Firstly, these are the flares occurring in the regions with unbalanced magnetic flux. Secondly, and most interesting, it is possible to identify the AMFs with much more complex spatial configurations as compared to the previously-known ones, e.g., involving five luminous ribbons with a nontrivial arrangement. As follows from the corresponding magnetograms, they are produced by the effective magnetic sources (sunspots) of different polarity with intermittent arrangement, but their number is greater than in the standard GKSS model.","Yu.

336,"Phase curves and secondary eclipses of gaseous exoplanets are diagnostic of atmospheric composition and meteorology, and the long observational baseline and high photometric precision from the Kepler Mission make its dataset well-suited for exploring phase curve variability, which provides additional insights into atmospheric dynamics. Observations of the hot Jupiter Kepler-76b span more than 1,000 days, providing an ideal dataset to search for atmospheric variability. In this study, we find that Kepler-76b's secondary eclipse, with a depth of $87 \pm 6$ parts-per-million (ppm), corresponds to an effective temperature of 2,830$^{+50}_{-30}$ K. Our results also show clear indications of variability in Kepler-76b's atmospheric emission and reflectivity, with the phase curve amplitude typically $50.5 \pm 1.3$ ppm but varying between 35 and 70 ppm over tens of days. As is common for hot Jupiters, Kepler-76b's phase curve shows a discernible offset of $\left( 9 \pm 1.3 \right)^\circ$ eastward of the sub-stellar point and varying in concert with the amplitude. These variations may arise from the advance and retreat of thermal structures and cloud formations in Kepler-76b's atmosphere; the resulting thermal perturbations may couple with the super-rotation expected to transport aerosols, giving rise to a feedback loop. Looking forward, the TESS Mission can provide new insight into planetary atmospheres, with good prospects to observe both secondary eclipses and phase curves among targets from the mission. TESS's increased sensitivity in red wavelengths as compared to Kepler means that it will probably probe different aspects of planetary atmospheres.","Brian Jackson, Elisabeth Adams, Wesley Sandidge, Steven Kreyche, Jennifer Briggs","27 pages, 10 figures; In press with ApJ",1905.07781v1,No journal ref found,Jennifer Briggs,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07781v1,2019-05-19 17:33:06+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Variability in the Atmosphere of the Hot Jupiter Kepler-76b,2019-05-19 17:33:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07781v1
337,"In this work we introduce an effective model of $f(R)$ gravity containing a non-minimal coupling to the axion scalar field. The axion field is described by the misalignment model, in which the primordial $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken during inflation and the $f(R)$ gravity is described by the $R^2$ model, and in addition, the non-minimal coupling has the form $\sim h(\phi)R^{\gamma}$, with $0<\gamma<0.75$. By appropriately constraining the non-minimal coupling at early times, the axion field remains frozen in its primordial vacuum expectation value, and the $R^2$ gravity dominates the inflationary era. As the Universe expands, when $H$ equals the axion mass $m_a$ and for cosmic times for which $m_a\gg H$, the axion field oscillates. By assuming a slowly varying evolution of the axion field, the axion energy density scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, where $a$ is the scale factor, regardless of the background Hubble rate, thus behaving as cold dark matter. At late times, the axion still evolves as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, however the Hubble rate of the expansion and thus the dynamical evolution of the Universe is controlled by terms containing the higher derivatives of $\sim R^{\gamma}$, which are related to the non-minimal coupling, and as we demonstrate, the resulting solution of the Friedman equation at late times is an approximate de Sitter evolution. The late-time de Sitter Hubble rate scales as $H\sim \Lambda^{1/2}$, where $\Lambda$ is an integration constant of the theory, which has its allowed values very close to the current value of the cosmological constant. Finally, the theory has a prediction for the existence of a pre-inflationary primordial stiff era, in which the energy density of the axion scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-6}$.","S. D. Odintsov, V. K.

338,"Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars ($\leq$1 $M_\odot$). Unfortunately, rotation period $(P_{\rm rot})$ measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., $P_{\rm rot} \propto \sqrt{\rm age}$): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag\""ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the $\approx$1.4-Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf $P_{\rm rot}$ stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the $\approx$1-Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure $P_{\rm rot}$ for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from $\approx$0.8 to $\approx$0.6 $M_\odot$. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04$\pm$0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-$P_{\rm rot}$ sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to $T_{\rm eff} \approx 4295$ K (K5V, 0.7 $M_\odot$), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with $P_{\rm rot}$ for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where $P_{\rm rot}$ stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.","Jason Lee Curtis, Marcel A.

339,"We argue that some scenarios for the enigmatic supernova (SN) iPTF14hls and its progenitor require a strong binary interaction. We examine scenarios that attribute the extra power of iPTF14hls to a magnetar, to a late fallback on to the neutron star (NS) that launches jets, to an interaction of the ejecta with a circumstellar matter (CSM), or to a common envelope jets SN (CEJSN). For each of these four scenarios, we study the crucial process that supplies the extra energy and conclude that a binary companion to the progenitor must be present. For the magnetar scenario and late jets we claim that a companion should spin-up the pre-collapse core, in the ejecta-CSM scenario we find that the formation of the equatorial CSM requires a companion, and in the CEJSN where a NS spirals-in inside the giant envelope of the progenitor and launches jets the strong binary interaction is built-in. We argue that these types of strong binary interactions make the scenarios rare and explain the enigmatic nature of iPTF14hls. We further study processes that might accompany the binary interaction, in particular, the launching of jets before, during and after the explosion and their observational consequences. We do not consider the difficulties of the different scenarios and neither do we determine the best scenario for iPTF14hls. We rather focus on the binary nature of these scenarios that might as well explain other rare types of SNe.","Roni Anna Gofman, Noam Soker",Submitted,1905.05573v2,No journal ref found,Noam Soker,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05573v2,2019-05-14 13:02:32+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,The strongly interacting binary scenarios of the enigmatic supernova   iPTF14hls,2019-05-19 12:57:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05573v2
340,"I study the rate of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within about a million years after the assumed common envelope evolution (CEE) that forms the progenitors of these SNe Ia, and find that the population of SNe Ia with short CEE to explosion delay (CEED) time is few times 0.1 of all SNe Ia. I also claim for an expression for the rate of these SNe Ia that occur at short times after the CEE, t<10^6 yr, that is different from that of the delay time distribution (DTD) billions of years after star formation. This tentatively hints that the physical processes that determine the short CEED times are different (at least to some extend) from those that determine the DTD at billions of years. To reach these conclusions I examine SNe Ia that interact with a circumstellar matter (CSM) within months after explosion, so called SNe Ia-CSM, and the rate of SNe Ia that on a time scale of tens to hundreds of years interact with a CSM that might have been a planetary nebula, so called SNe Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIPs). I assume that the CSM in these populations results from a CEE, and hence this study is relevant mainly to the core degenerate (CD) scenario, to the double degenerate (DD) scenario, to the double detonation (DDet) scenario with white dwarf companions, and to the CEE-wind channel of the single degenerate (SD) scenario.",Noam Soker,Submitted after receiving helpful comments from readers,1905.06025v2,No journal ref found,Noam Soker,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06025v2,2019-05-15 08:24:15+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Common envelope to explosion delay time of type Ia supernovae,2019-05-19 12:23:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06025v2

343,"We present an analysis of seven strongly gravitationally lensed quasars and the corresponding constraints on the properties of dark matter. Our results are derived by modelling the lensed image positions and flux-ratios using a combination of smooth macro models and a population of low-mass haloes within the mass range $10^6$ to $10^9$ M$_\odot$. Our lens models explicitly include higher-order complexity in the form of stellar discs and luminous satellites, and low-mass haloes located along the observed lines of sight for the first time. Assuming a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmology, we infer an average total mass fraction in substructure of $f_{\rm sub} = 0.011^{+0.007}_{-0.005}$ (68 per cent confidence limits), which is in agreement with the predictions from CDM hydrodynamical simulations to within 1$\sigma$. This result is significantly different when compared to previous studies that did not include line-of-sight haloes. Under the assumption of a thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) model, we derive a lower limit on the particle relic mass of $m_{\rm wdm} > 3.8$ keV (95 per cent confidence limits), which is consistent with a value of $m_{\rm wdm} > 3.5$ keV from the recent analysis of the Ly$\alpha$ forest.","Jen-Wei Hsueh, Wolfgang Enzi, Simona Vegetti, Matt Auger, Christopher D.

344,"Observational work have shown that the two brightest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are rare amongst MW analogues. It is then interesting to know whether the presence of massive satellite has any effect on the whole satellite population in MW analogues. In this article, we investigate this problem using a semi-analytical model combined with the Millennium-II Simulation. MW-analogous galaxies are defined to have similar stellar mass or dark matter halo mass to the MW. We find that, in the first case, the halo mass is larger and there are, on average, twice as many satellites in Milky Way analogs if there is a massive satellite galaxy in the system. This is mainly from the halo formation bias. The difference is smaller if MW analogues are selected using halo mass. We also find that the satellites distribution is slightly asymmetric, being more concentrated on the line connecting the central galaxy and the massive satellite and that, on average, LMC have brought in 14.7 satellite galaxies with $M_{r}<0$ at its accretion, among which 4.5 satellites are still within a distance of 50kpc from the LMC. Considering other satellites, we predict that thereare 7.8 satellites with 50kpc of the LMC. By comparing our model with the early data of Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA), a survey to observe satellite galaxies around 100 Milky Way analogues, we find that SAGA has more bright satellites and less faint satellites than our model predictions. A future comparison with the final SAGA data is needed.","Dali Zhang, Yu Luo, Xi Kang","9 pages, 10 figures, published in MNRAS",1904.04296v2,No journal ref found,Xi Kang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04296v2,2019-04-08 19:00:32+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The effect of Large Magellanic Cloud on the satellite galaxy population   in Milky Way analogous Galaxies,2019-05-19 05:55:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04296v2
345,"An important question when studying the light curves produced by hot spots on the surface of rotating neutron stars is, how might the shape of the light curve be affected by relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions that one would adopt on a first treatment of the problem, such as that of a point-like spot. In this work we explore the dependence of light curves on the size and shape of a single hot spot on the surface of slowly-rotating neutron stars. More specifically, we consider two different shapes for the hot spots (circular and annular) and examine the resulting light curves as functions of the opening angle of the hot spot (for both) and width (for the latter). We find that the point-like approximation can describe light curves reasonably well, if the opening angle of the hot spot is less than $\sim 5^\circ$. Furthermore, we find that light curves from annular spots are almost the same as those of the full circular spot if the opening angle is less than $\sim 35^\circ$ independently of the hot spot's width.","Hajime Sotani, Hector O.

346,"Jupiter's magnetic field is generated by the convection of liquid metallic hydrogen in its interior. The transition from molecular hydrogen to metallic hydrogen as temperature and pressure increase is believed to be a smooth one. As a result, the electrical conductivity in Jupiter varies continuously from being negligible at the surface to a large value in the deeper region. Thus, unlike the Earth where the upper boundary of the dynamo---the dynamo radius---is definitively located at the core-mantle boundary, it is not clear at what depth dynamo action becomes significant in Jupiter. In this paper, using a numerical model of the Jovian dynamo, we examine the magnetic energy spectrum at different depth and identify a dynamo radius below which (and away from the deep inner core) the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum becomes invariant. We find that this shift in the behaviour of the magnetic energy spectrum signifies a change in the dynamics of the system as electric current becomes important. Traditionally, a characteristic radius derived from the Lowes--Mauersberger spectrum---the Lowes radius---gives a good estimate to the Earth's core-mantle boundary. We argue that in our model, the Lowes radius provides a lower bound to the dynamo radius. We also compare the Lowes--Mauersberger spectrum in our model to that obtained from recent Juno observations. The Lowes radius derived from the Juno data is significantly lower than that obtained from our models.

347,"Weak flaring events are frequent and ubiquitous in the solar corona. They derive their energy from the local magnetic field and form a major source of local heating. These heating signatures make them discernible in the EUV and X-ray bands. However, their radio emission arise from various plasma instabilities that lead to coherent emission, making even a weak flare very bright in radio band. Owing to the non-thermal emission mechanisms involved, the radio observations probe the physical attributes unexplored by the high energy observations. However, the studies of radio emission from these events require imaging with sub-second and sub-MHz resolutions owing to their high spectro-temporal variability. Additionally, these events being quite frequent and ubiquitous, high fidelity and dynamic range imaging is required to monitor individual events continuously. It is only now that such observations are becoming possible. We present a spatially resolved study of a weak flaring site using imaging observations at metrewave, EUV and X-ray bands, along with magnetogram observations. We establish that X-ray, EUV and radio emissions share a common driver. We report the discovery of $30\ s$ quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the radio light curve, which is accompanied by an enhancement in the observed baseline radio flux density during the flare. The QPO timescale match the local Alfv\'{e}n timescales across the typical braiding scales in the system. Our observations suggest a scenario where magnetic strain systematically builds up over this timescale and then dissipates via a cascade of weak reconnection events.","Atul Mohan, Patrick I.

348,"Complete integrability of geodesic motion, the well known feature of the fields of isolated stationary black holes, can easily be ""spoilt"" by the presence of some additional source (even if highly symmetric). In previous papers, we used various methods to show how free time-like motion becomes chaotic if the gravitational field of the Schwarzschild black hole is perturbed by that of a circular disc or ring, considering specifically the inverted first disc of the Morgan-Morgan counter-rotating family and the Bach-Weyl ring as the additional sources. The present paper focuses on two new points. First, since the Bach-Weyl thin ring is physically quite unsatisfactory, we now repeat some of the analysis for a different, Majumdar-Papapetrou--type (extremally charged) ring around an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, and compare the results with those obtained before. We also argue that such a system is in fact more relevant astrophysically than it may seem. Second, we check numerically, for the latter system as well as for the Schwarzschild black hole encircled by the inverted Morgan-Morgan disc, how indicative is the geometric (curvature) criterion for chaos suggested by Sota, Suzuki & Maeda (1996). We also add a review of the literature where the relevance of geometric criteria in general relativity (as well as elsewhere) has been discussed for decades.","L. Polcar, P. SukovÃ¡, O.

349,"Fingering convection is a turbulent mixing process that can occur in stellar radiative regions whenever the mean molecular weight increases with radius. In some cases, it can have a significant observable impact on stellar structure and evolution. The efficiency of mixing by fingering convection as a standalone process has been studied by Brown et al. (2013), but other processes such as rotation, magnetic fields and shear can affect it. In this paper, we present a first study of the effect of shear on fingering (thermohaline) convection in astrophysics. Using Direct Numerical Simulations we find that a moderate amount of shear (that is not intrinsically shear-unstable) always decreases the mixing efficiency of fingering convection, as a result of the tilt it imparts to the fingering structures. We propose a simple analytical extension of the Brown et al. (2013) model in the presence of shear that satisfactorily explains the numerically-derived turbulent compositional mixing coefficient for moderate shearing rates, and can trivially be implemented in stellar evolution codes. We also measure from the numerical simulations a turbulent viscosity, and find that the latter is strongly tied to the turbulent compositional mixing coefficient. Observational implications and caveats of the model are discussed.","P. Garaud, A. Kumar, J. Sridhar",Submitted to ApJ,1905.07636v1,No journal ref found,J.

351,"This paper compares the performance of two different high-precision, photometric measurement techniques for bright (<11 magnitude) stars using the small telescope systems that today's amateur astronomers typically use. One technique is based on recent work using a beam-shaping diffuser method (Stefansson et al., (2017).) The other is based on the widely used ""defocusing"" method. We also developed and used a statistical photometric performance model to better understand the error components of the measurements to identify and quantify any difference in performance between the two methods. AstroImageJ (Collins et al. (2017)) was used for the exoplanet image analysis to provide the measured values and exoplanet models described in this study. Both methods were used at the Mark Slade Remote Observatory (MSRO) to conduct in-transit exoplanet observations of exoplanets HAT-P-30b/WASP-51b, HAT-P-16b, and a partial of WASP-93b. Observations of exoplanets KELT-1b and K2-100b and other stars were also performed at the MSRO to further understand and characterize the performance of the diffuser method under various sky conditions. In addition, both in-transit and out-of-transit observations of exoplanets HAT-P-23b, HAT-P-33b, and HAT-P-34b were performed at the Conti Private Observatory. We found that for observing bright stars, the diffuser method outperformed the defocus method when using small telescopes with poor tracking. We also found the diffuser method noticeably reduced the scintillation noise compared with the defocus method and provided high-precision results in typical, average sky conditions through all lunar phases. For small telescopes using excellent auto-guiding techniques and effective calibration procedures, we found the defocus method was equal to or in some cases better than the diffuser method when observing with good-to-excellent sky conditions.","Gerald R.

352,"The galactic cosmic rays are generally believed to be originated in supernova remnants (SNRs), produced in diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) process in supernova blast waves driven by expanding SNRs. One of the key unsettled issue in SNR origin of cosmic ray model is the maximum attainable energy by a cosmic ray particle in the supernova shock. Recently it has been suggested that an amplification of effective magnetic field strength at the shock may take place in young SNRs due to growth of magnetic waves induced by accelerated cosmic rays and as a result the maximum energy achieved by cosmic rays in SNR may reach the knee energy instead of $\sim 200$ TeV as predicted earlier under normal magnetic field situation. In the present work we investigate the implication of such maximum energy scenarios on TeV gamma rays and neutrino fluxes from the molecular clouds interacting with the SNR W28. The authors compute the gamma-ray and neutrino flux assuming two different values for the maximum energy reached by cosmic rays in the SNR, from CR interaction in nearby molecular clouds. Both protons and nuclei are considered as accelerated particles and as target material. Our findings suggest that the issue of the maximum energy of cosmic rays in SNRs can be observationally settled by the upcoming gamma-ray experiment the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The estimated neutrino fluxes from the molecular clouds are , however, out of reach of the present/near future generation of neutrino telescopes.","Prabir Banik, Arunava Bhadra","18 pages, 4 figures",1905.07571v1,No journal ref found,Arunava Bhadra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07571v1,2019-05-18 10:07:50+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Probing maximum energy of cosmic rays in SNR through gamma rays and   neutrinos from the molecular clouds around SNR W28,2019-05-18 10:07:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07571v1
353,"This work purports to help understand the InterStellar Extinction Curve in and near the visible range. In this range, crystalline materials are known to be transparent, so amorphous dust is needed. Molecular modeling experiments are used to compute the electronic spectra of various, relatively large, carbon and silicate structures. Hardly any transition shows up beyond 0.4 mum when the structure is in its ground state (the lowest, most stable state, usually crystalline). This is no longer the case as soon as the structure is distorted in any way. Examples of simulated distortions (or ``defects'') are: angular or linear bond alteration, insertion of free radicals near the main structure, dangling bonds; their cumulative effects lead to the amorphous state. It is shown that, in this state, a structure bears a majority of weak transitions and a minority of strong ones. As the structure grows in size, the former ultimately form a weak continuum already detected experimentally, in the visible, on amorphous carbons and silicates. The stronger transitions will manage to emerge above the continuum, especially when they bunch together by chance near the same wavelength.

356,"We perform a series of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate how a hot magnetic jet propagates within the dynamical ejecta of a binary neutron star merger, with the focus on how the jet structure depends on the delay time of jet launching with respect to the merger time, $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$. We find that regardless of the jet launching delay time, a structured jet with an angle-dependent luminosity and Lorentz factor is always formed after the jet breaks out the ejecta. On the other hand, the jet launching delay time has an impact on the jet structure. If the jet launching delay time is relatively long, e.g., $\ge 0.5$ s, the line-of-sight material has a dominant contribution from the cocoon. On the other hand, for a relatively short jet launching delay time, the jet penetrates through the ejecta early on and develops an angular structure afterward. The line-of-sight ejecta is dominated by the structured jet itself. We discuss the case of GW170817/GRB 170817A within the framework of both long and short $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$. Future more observations of GW/GRB associations can help to differentiate between these two scenarios.","Jin-Jun Geng, Bing Zhang, Anders KÃ¶lligan, Rolf Kuiper, Yong-Feng Huang","6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted by ApJL",1904.02326v2,No journal ref found,Yong-Feng Huang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02326v2,2019-04-04 03:08:16+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,"Propagation of a Short GRB Jet in the Ejecta: Jet Launching Delay Time,   Jet Structure, and GW170817/GRB 170817A",2019-05-18 06:26:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02326v2
357,"We use reconstructed star-formation histories (SFHs) of quiescent galaxies at $z=0.6-1$ in the LEGA-C survey to identify secondary star-formation episodes that, after an initial period of quiescence, moved the galaxies back to the star-forming main sequence (blue cloud). $16\pm3$\% of the $z\sim0.8$ quiescent population has experienced such rejuvenation events in the redshift range $0.7<z<1.5$ after reaching quiescence at some earlier time. On average, these galaxies first became quiescent at $z=1.2$, and those that rejuvenated, remained quiescent for $\sim1$Gyr before their secondary SF episode which lasted $\sim0.7$Gyr. The stellar mass attributed to rejuvenation is on average 10\% of the galaxy stellar mass, with rare instances of an increase of more than a factor 2. Overall, rejuvenation events only contribute $\sim2$\% of the total stellar mass in $z\sim0.8$ quiescent galaxies and we conclude that rejuvenation is not an important evolutionary channel when considering the growth of the red sequence.

359,"Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) of $10^{4-7} \rm M_{\odot}$, forming in the aftermath of galaxy mergers, are primary targets of the space mission LISA, the {\it Laser Interferometer Space Antenna}. An assessment of LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this aim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within their host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the binaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with physically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\approx 25$ and $\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to $\sim 30\%$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall, triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation, resulting in about $\approx 10$ to $\approx 20$ LISA detections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can produce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.9$) upon entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant ($\sim 0.1$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.","Matteo Bonetti, Alberto Sesana, Francesco Haardt, Enrico Barausse, Monica Colpi","17 pages, 10 figures, Accepted MNRAS",1812.01011v2,No journal ref found,Monica Colpi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01011v2,2018-12-03 19:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Post-Newtonian Evolution of Massive Black Hole Triplets in Galactic   Nuclei: IV.

360,"We use the \eagle\ simulations to study the connection between the quenching timescale, $\tau_{\rm Q}$, and the physical mechanisms that transform star-forming galaxies into passive galaxies. By quantifying $\tau_{\rm Q}$ in two complementary ways - as the time over which (i) galaxies traverse the green valley on the colour-mass diagram, or (ii) leave the main sequence of star formation and subsequently arrive on the passive cloud in specific star formation rate (SSFR)-mass space - we find that the $\tau_{\rm Q}$ distribution of high-mass centrals, low-mass centrals and satellites are divergent. In the low stellar mass regime where $M_{\star}<10^{9.6}M_{\odot}$, centrals exhibit systematically longer quenching timescales than satellites ($\approx 4$~Gyr compared to $\approx 2$~Gyr). Satellites with low stellar mass relative to their halo mass cause this disparity, with ram pressure stripping quenching these galaxies rapidly. Low mass centrals are quenched as a result of stellar feedback, associated with long $\tau_{\rm Q}\gtrsim 3$~Gyr. At intermediate stellar masses where $10^{9.7}\,\rm M_{\odot}<M_{\star}<10^{10.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, $\tau_{\rm Q}$ are the longest for both centrals and satellites, particularly for galaxies with higher gas fractions. At $M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, galaxy merger counts and black hole activity increase steeply for all galaxies. Quenching timescales for centrals and satellites decrease with stellar mass in this regime to $\tau_{\rm Q}\lesssim2$~Gyr. In anticipation of new intermediate redshift observational galaxy surveys, we analyse the passive and star-forming fractions of galaxies across redshift, and find that the $\tau_{\rm Q}$ peak at intermediate stellar masses is responsible for a peak (inflection point) in the fraction of green valley central (satellite) galaxies at $z\approx 0.5-0.7$.","Ruby J.

These issues are particularly significant for Antarctica- and space-based experiments, which depend on satellite links to transmit data. We explore the viability of reducing the time ordered data to few bit numbers to address these challenges. Unlike lossless compression, few bit digitisation introduces additional noise into the data. We present a set of one, two, and three bit digitisation schemes and measure the increase in noise in the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarisation power spectra. The digitisation noise is independent of angular scale and is well-described as a constant percentage of the original detector noise. Three bit digitisation increases the map noise level by < 2%, while reducing the data volume by a factor of ten relative to 32-bit floats. Extreme digitisation is a promising strategy for upcoming experiments.","L. Balkenhol, C. L. Reichardt","9 pages, 2 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1810.03789v3,No journal ref found,C. L.

362,"Inspired by the swampland distance conjecture and the high-slope conjecture, we present two families of multi-field inflationary potentials compatible with the conjectures along the trajectory. One family is a helix-type potential that satisfies the conjectures only locally. This family inflates with $\epsilon_V\gg\epsilon_H$ and produces Planck-compatible scalar perturbations, but a too-high tensor power. Our other family of potentials globally satisfies the swampland conjectures and is in negatively-curved field space. It balances the potential gradient against the geometry to generate high turning rates. Due to the form of the potential, this model has exactly massless entropic perturbations and a light adiabatic mode. In the superhorizon limit, the entropic mode freezes out, which sources linear growth of the adiabatic mode. In contrast to hyperinflation, both families remain under perturbative control.","Vikas Aragam, Sonia Paban, Robert Rosati","27 pages, 5 figures",1905.07495v1,No journal ref found,Robert Rosati,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07495v1,2019-05-17 22:35:46+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO,Multi-field Inflation in High-Slope Potentials,2019-05-17 22:35:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07495v1
363,"The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) could be revolutionary for MeV neutrino astrophysics, because of its huge detector volume, unique event reconstruction capabilities, and excellent sensitivity to the $\nu_e$ flavor. However, its backgrounds are not yet known. A major background is expected due to muon spallation of argon, which produces unstable isotopes that later beta decay. We present the first comprehensive study of MeV spallation backgrounds in argon, detailing isotope production mechanisms and decay properties, analyzing beta energy and time distributions, and proposing experimental cuts. We show that above a nominal detection threshold of 5-MeV electron energy, the most important backgrounds are --- surprisingly --- due to low-A isotopes, such as Li, Be, and B, even though high-A isotopes near argon are abundantly produced. We show that spallation backgrounds can be powerfully rejected by simple cuts, with clear paths for improvements. We compare these background rates to rates of possible MeV astrophysical neutrino signals in DUNE, including solar neutrinos (detailed in a companion paper [Capozzi et al. arXiv:1808.08232 [hep-ph]]), supernova burst neutrinos, and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Further, to aid trigger strategies, in the Appendixes we quantify the rates of single and multiple MeV events due to spallation, radiogenic neutron capture, and other backgrounds, including through pileup.

364,"The 2017 detection of the inspiral and merger of two neutron stars in gravitational waves and gamma rays was accompanied by a quickly-reddening transient. Such a transient was predicted to occur following a rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis event, which synthesizes neutron-rich, radioactive nuclei and can take place in both dynamical ejecta and in the wind driven off the accretion torus formed after a neutron star merger. We present the first three-dimensional general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD) simulations of the black hole-accretion disk-wind system produced by the GW170817 merger. We show that the small but non-negligible optical depths lead to neutrino transport globally coupling the disk electron fraction, which we capture by solving the transport equation with a Monte Carlo method. The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as $Y_e\sim 0.4$ in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.","Jonah M. Miller, Benjamin R. Ryan, Joshua C.

365,"We introduce a new approach for cosmological parameter estimation based on the information-theoretical Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), calculating it for models in the restricted parameter space {H0, w0, wa}, where H0 is the value of the Hubble constant today, and w0 and wa are dark energy parameters, with the other parameters held fixed at their best-fit values from the Planck 2018 data. As an application, we investigate the H0 tension between the Planck data and the local astronomical data by comparing the Lambda-CDM model with the wCDM and the w0waCDM dynamic dark energy models. We find agreement with other works using the standard Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, but, in addition, show that while the JSD is equally minimized for both values of H0 along the (w0,wa) plane, the lines of degeneracy are different for each value of H0. This allows for distinguishing between the two, once the value of either w0 or wa is known.","Michelle Stephens, Marcelo Gleiser","5 pages, 3 figures",1905.07472v1,No journal ref found,Marcelo Gleiser,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07472v1,2019-05-17 20:50:41+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,An Informational Approach to Cosmological Parameter Estimation,2019-05-17 20:50:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07472v1
366,"We present a suite of 34 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations consisting of thousands of halos up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (M_star~10^10.5 M_sun) at z>=5 from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. We post-process our simulations with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code to study dust extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature within these simulated z>=5 galaxies. Our sample forms a tight correlation between infrared excess (IRX=F_IR/F_UV) and ultraviolet (UV)-continuum slope (beta_UV), despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations. We find that the IRX-beta_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization (set by the dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric IR luminosity (L_IR) correlates with the intrinsic UV luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over the past 10 Myr. We predict that at a given L_IR, the peak wavelength of the dust spectral energy distributions for z>=5 galaxies is smaller by a factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on average) than at z=0. The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher specific SFRs and SFR surface densities with increasing redshift. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity functions (LFs) at z=5-10 from our simulations and confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to reproduce the observed bright-end UVLFs. We also predict the IRLFs and UV luminosity densities at z=5-10. We discuss the implications of our results on current and future observations probing dust attenuation and emission in z>=5 galaxies.","Xiangcheng Ma, Christopher C. Hayward, Caitlin M.

367,"We report on a possible cloud-cloud collision in the DR 21 region, which we found through molecular observations with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We mapped an area of 8'x12' around the region with twenty molecular lines including the 12CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=1-0) emission lines, and sixteen of them were significantly detected. Based on the 12CO and 13CO data, we found five distinct velocity components in the observed region, and we call molecular gas associated with these components -42, -22, -3, 9, and 17 km/s clouds taking after their typical radial velocities. The -3 km/s cloud is the main filamentary cloud (31,000 Mo) associated with young massive stars such as DR21 and DR21(OH), and the 9 km/s cloud is a smaller cloud (3,400 Mo) which may be an extension of the W75 region in the north. The other clouds are much smaller. We found a clear anticorrelation in the distributions of the -3 and 9 km/s clouds, and detected faint 12CO emission having intermediate velocities bridging the two clouds at their intersection. These facts strongly indicate that the two clouds are colliding against each other. In addition, we found that DR21 and DR21(OH) are located in the periphery of the densest part of the 9 km/s cloud, which is consistent with results of recent numerical simulations of cloud-cloud collisions. We therefore suggest that the -3 and 9 km/s clouds are colliding, and that the collision induced the massive star formation in the DR21 cloud. The interaction of the -3 and 9 km/s clouds was previously suggested by Dickel et al. (1978), and our results strongly support their hypothesis of the interaction.","Kazuhito Dobashi, Tomomi Shimoikura, Shou Katakura, Fumitaka Nakamura, Yoshito Shimajiri","To appear in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan

368,"We present radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations aimed at studying evolutionary properties of H\,{\normalsize II} regions in turbulent, magnetised, and collapsing molecular clouds formed by converging flows in the warm neutral medium. We focus on the structure, dynamics and expansion laws of these regions. Once a massive star forms in our highly structured clouds, its ionising radiation eventually stops the accretion (through filaments) toward the massive star-forming regions. The new over-pressured H\,{\normalsize II} regions push away the dense gas, thus disrupting the more massive collapse centres. Also, because of the complex density structure in the cloud, the H\,{\normalsize II} regions expand in a hybrid manner: they virtually do not expand toward the densest regions (cores), while they expand according to the classical analytical result towards the rest of the cloud, and in an accelerated way, as a blister region, towards the diffuse medium. Thus, the ionised regions grow anisotropically, and the ionising stars generally appear off-centre of the regions. Finally, we find that the hypotheses assumed in standard H\,{\normalsize II}-region expansion models (fully embedded region, blister-type, or expansion in a density gradient) apply simultaneously in different parts of our simulated H\,{\normalsize II} regions, producing a net expansion law ($R \propto t^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ in the range of 0.93-1.47 and a mean value of $1.2 \pm 0.17$) that differs from any of those of the standard models.","Manuel Zamora-AvilÃ©s, Enrique VÃ¡zquez-Semadeni, Ricardo F.

369,"The recently measured cutoff, k_min=[4.34(+/-)0.50]/r_cmb (with r_cmb the comoving distance to the last scattering surface), in the fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, appears to disfavor slow-roll inflation and the associated transition of modes across the horizon. We show in this Letter that k_min instead corresponds to the first mode emerging out of the Planck domain into the semi-classical universe. The required scalar-field potential is exponential, though not inflationary, and satisfies the zero active mass condition, rho_phi+3p_phi=0. Quite revealingly, the observed amplitude of the temperature anisotropies requires the quantum fluctuations in phi to have classicalized at ~3.5x10^15 GeV, consistent with the energy scale in grand unified theories.

370,"Baksan Experiment on Sterile Neutrino (BEST) is presently at the stage of production of the artificial neutrino source Cr-51, the gallium exposure will start in July and proceed for three months. While aiming specifically at investigating the Gallium neutrino anomaly (SAGE and GALLEX experiments), BEST can do more and it is tempting to estimate its ability in testing sterile neutrino explanation of antineutrino (reactor) anomalies. We observe a moderate sensitivity to the region in model parameter space (sterile neutrino mass and mixing with active electron neutrino) outlined by the old reactor antineutrino anomaly and the best fit of DANSS experiment, while the Neutrino-4 favorite region falls right in the BEST ballpark. In particular, by analyzing SAGE+GALLEX and Neutrino-4 $\chi^2$ distributions we find that Neutrino-4 results are fully consistent with the Gallium anomaly, the significance of the combined anomaly almost reaches 4$\sigma$ level. If the BEST confirms the Neutrino-4 results, the joint analysis will indicate more than 5$\sigma$ evidence for the sterile neutrino of eV-scale mass.","Vladislav Barinov, Vladimir Gavrin, Valery Gorbachev, Dmitry Gorbunov, Tatiana Ibragimova",4 pages,1905.07437v1,No journal ref found,Tatiana Ibragimova,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07437v1,2019-05-17 18:46:24+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-ex,BEST potential in testing eV-scale sterile neutrino explanation of   reactor antineutrino anomalies,2019-05-17 18:46:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07437v1
371,"We use Bayesian convolutional neural networks and a novel generative model of Galaxy Zoo volunteer responses to infer posteriors for the visual morphology of galaxies. Bayesian CNN can learn from galaxy images with uncertain labels and then, for previously unlabelled galaxies, predict the probability of each possible label. Our posteriors are well-calibrated (e.g. for predicting bars, we achieve coverage errors of 10.6% within 5 responses and 2.9% within 10 responses) and hence are reliable for practical use. Further, using our posteriors, we apply the active learning strategy BALD to request volunteer responses for the subset of galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our network. We show that training our Bayesian CNNs using active learning requires up to 35-60% fewer labelled galaxies, depending on the morphological feature being classified. By combining human and machine intelligence, Galaxy Zoo will be able to classify surveys of any conceivable scale on a timescale of weeks, providing massive and detailed morphology catalogues to support research into galaxy evolution.","Mike Walmsley, Lewis Smith, Chris Lintott, Yarin Gal, Steven Bamford, Hugh Dickinson, Lucy Fortson, Sandor Kruk, Karen Masters, Claudia Scarlata, Brooke Simmons, Rebecca Smethurst, Darryl Wright",Submitted to MNRAS,1905.07424v1,No journal ref found,Darryl Wright,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07424v1,2019-05-17 18:20:35+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|cs.CV,Galaxy Zoo: Probabilistic Morphology through Bayesian CNNs and Active   Learning,2019-05-17 18:20:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07424v1
372,"Photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) is imperative as recent and upcoming optical time-domain surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), overwhelm the available resources for spectrosopic follow-up. Here we develop a range of light curve classification pipelines, trained on 518 spectroscopically-classified SNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1-MDS): 357 Type Ia, 93 Type II, 25 Type IIn, 21 Type Ibc, and 17 Type I SLSNe. We present a new parametric analytical model that can accommodate a broad range of SN light curve morphologies, including those with a plateau, and fit this model to data in four PS1 filters (griz). We test a number of feature extraction methods, data augmentation strategies, and machine learning algorithms to predict the class of each SN. Our best pipelines result in 90% average accuracy, 70% average purity, and 80% average completeness for all SN classes, with the highest success rates for Type Ia SNe and SLSNe and the lowest for Type Ibc SNe. Despite the greater complexity of our classification scheme, the purity of our Type Ia SN classification, 95%, is on par with methods developed specifically for Type Ia versus non-Type Ia binary classification. As the first of its kind, this study serves as a guide to developing and training classification algorithms for a wide range of SN types with a purely empirical training set, particularly one that is similar in its characteristics to the expected LSST main survey strategy. Future work will implement this classification pipeline on ~3000 PS1/MDS light curves that lack spectroscopic classification.","V. A. Villar, E. Berger, G. Miller, R. Chornock, A. Rest, D. O.

373,"In a recent paper we have shown that a minimally coupled, self-interacting scalar field of mass $m$ can form black holes of mass $M=\sqrt{3}/(4m)$ (in Planck units). If dark matter is composed by axions, they can form miniclusters that for QCD axions have masses below this value. In this work it is shown that for a scenario in which the axion mass depends on the temperature as $m \propto T^{-6}$, minicluster masses above $0.32\,M_\odot$, corresponding to an axion mass of $3\times 10^{-10}$ eV, exceed $M$ and can collapse into black holes. If a fraction of these black holes is in binary systems, gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase could be detected by advanced interferometers like LIGO or VIRGO and by the planned Einstein Telescope. For a detection rate of one event per year, the lower limits on the binary fraction are $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-6}$ for LIGO and Einstein Telescope respectively.","J. A. de Freitas Pacheco, S.

374,"Using a semi-analytic model of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration, we model the spectrum of cosmic ray (CR) electrons accelerated by supernova remnants (SNRs). Because electrons experience synchrotron losses in the amplified magnetic fields characteristic of SNRs, they exhibit substantially steeper spectra than protons. In particular, we find that the difference between the electron and proton spectral index (power law slope) ranges from 0.1 to 0.4. Our findings must be reckoned with theories of Galactic CR transport, which often assume that electrons and protons are injected with the same slope, and may especially have implications for the observed ``positron excess.""","Rebecca Diesing, Damiano Caprioli","6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PRL",1905.07414v1,No journal ref found,Damiano Caprioli,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07414v1,2019-05-17 18:00:04+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,On the Spectrum of Electrons Accelerated in Supernova Remnants,2019-05-17 18:00:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07414v1

376,"Cosmological probes pose an inverse problem where the measurement result is obtained through observations, and the objective is to infer values of model parameters which characterize the underlying physical system -- our Universe. Modern cosmological probes increasingly rely on measurements of the small-scale structure, and the only way to accurately model physical behavior on those scales, roughly 65 Mpc/h or smaller, is via expensive numerical simulations. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of a novel statistical framework for obtaining accurate parameter constraints by combining observations with a very limited number of cosmological simulations. The proposed framework utilizes multi-output Gaussian process emulators that are adaptively constructed using Bayesian optimization methods. We compare several approaches for constructing multi-output emulators that enable us to take possible inter-output correlations into account while maintaining the efficiency needed for inference. Using Lyman alpha forest flux power spectrum, we demonstrate that our adaptive approach requires considerably fewer --- by a factor of a few in Lyman alpha P(k) case considered here --- simulations compared to the emulation based on Latin hypercube sampling, and that the method is more robust in reconstructing parameters and their Bayesian credible intervals.","Timur Takhtaganov, Zarija Lukic, Juliane Mueller, Dmitriy Morozov","23 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ",1905.07410v1,No journal ref found,Dmitriy Morozov,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07410v1,2019-05-17 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.CO,Cosmic Inference: Constraining Parameters With Observations and Highly   Limited Number of Simulations,2019-05-17 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07410v1

378,"We report possible interaction between multiple super nova remnants (SNRs) and Northern Coal Sack (NCS) which is a massive clump (~1000 Mo) in the Cyg OB 7 cloud complex and is forming a massive Class 0 object. We performed molecular observations of the 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), and C18O(J=1-0) emission lines using the 45m telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, and we found that there are mainly four velocity components at Vlsr=-20, -6, -4, and 10 km/s. The -6 and -4 km/s components correspond to the systemic velocities of NCS and the Cygnus OB 7 complex, respectively, and the other velocity components originate from distinct smaller clouds. Interestingly, there are apparent correlations and anti-correlations among the spatial distributions of the four components, suggesting that they are physically interacting with one another. On a larger scale, we find that a group of small clouds belonging to the -20 and 10 km/s components are located along two different arcs around some SNRs including HB 21 which has been suggested to be interacting with the Cyg OB 7 cloud complex, and we also find that NCS is located right at the interface of the arcs. The small clouds are likely to be the gas swept up by the stellar wind of the massive stars which created the SNRs. We suggest that the small clouds alined along the two arcs recently encountered NCS and the massive star formation in NCS was triggered by the strong interaction with the small clouds.","Kazuhito Dobashi, Tomomi Shimoikura, Nobuhiro Endo, Chisato Takagi, Fumitaka Nakamura, Yoshito Shimajiri, Jean-Philippe Bernard","To appear in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan

We also reject 44 previously proposed candidate moving group members. Furthermore, we have newly identified or confirmed the youth of numerous additional stars that do not belong to any currently known group, and find 69 co-moving systems using Gaia DR2 astrometry.

For extremal Kerr-MOG BH, we determine the maximum gain in energy is $\Delta {\cal E} \leq \frac{1}{2} \left(\sqrt{\frac{\alpha+2}{1+\alpha}}-1 \right)$. We observe that the MOG parameter has a crucial role in the energy extraction process and it is in fact diminishes the value of $\Delta {\cal E}$ in contrast with extremal Kerr BH. Moreover, we derive the \emph{Wald inequality and the Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky inequality} for Kerr-MOG BH in contrast with Kerr BH. Furthermore, we describe the geodesic motion in terms of three fundamental frequencies: the Keplerian angular frequency, the radial epicyclic frequency and the vertical epicyclic frequency.

381,"We report on the discovery of a white dwarf companion to the nearby late G dwarf star, HD 159062. The companion is detected in 14 years of precise radial velocity (RV) data, and in high-resolution imaging observations. RVs of HD 159062 from 2003-2018 reveal an acceleration of $-13.3\pm0.12\ \rm{m s}^{-1}$, indicating that it hosts a companion with a long-period orbit. Subsequent imaging observations with the ShaneAO system on the Lick Observatory 3-meter Shane telescope, the PHARO AO system on the Palomar Observatory 5-meter telescope, and the NIRC2 AO system at the Keck II 10-meter telescope reveal a faint companion 2.7'' from the primary star. We performed relative photometry, finding $\Delta J = 10.09 \pm 0.38$ magnitudes, $\Delta K_{S} = 10.06 \pm 0.22$ magnitudes, and $\Delta L' = 9.67\pm0.08$ magnitudes for the companion from these observations. Analysis of the radial velocities, astrometry, and photometry reveals that the combined data set can only be reconciled for the scenario where HD 159062 B is a white dwarf. A full Bayesian analysis of the RV and imaging data to obtain the cooling age, mass, and orbital parameters of the white dwarf indicates that the companion is an old $M_{B} = 0.65^{+0.12}_{-0.04} M_{\odot}$ white dwarf with an orbital period of $P = 250^{+130}_{-76}$ years, and a cooling age of $\tau = 8.2^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$ Gyr.","Lea A.

382,"We propose a cosmological model, \""u$\Lambda$CDM, based on {\it \""uber-gravity}, which is a canonical ensemble average of many theories of gravity. In this model, we have a sharp transition from (a purely) $\Lambda$CDM era to a phase in which the Ricci scalar is a constant. This transition occurs when the Ricci scalar reaches a critical scale or alternatively at a transition redshift, $z_\oplus$. We use the observations of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia (SNe), as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to constrain \""u$\Lambda$CDM. This yields $H_0=70.6_{-1.3}^{+1.1}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m=0.2861 \pm{0.0092} $ and $z_\oplus=0.537_{-0.375}^{+0.277}$, providing a marginally better fit with a Akaike information criterion of 0.8. %After adding in the data from BAO in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in quasar spectra, we get $\Delta\chi^2=-2.14$, where the best fit occurs at $H_0=71.2_{-1.5}^{+1.8}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m=0.280\pm 0.013$ and $z_{\oplus}= 0.41^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$.

383,"Kepler-1647b is the most recently discovered planet that transits two stars, i.e., a circumbinary planet (CBP). Due to its large orbital separation, Kepler-1647b stands out from the rest of the Kepler CBPs, which mostly reside on much tighter orbits near the stability limit. The large separation of Kepler-1647b challenges inward disk migration as a dominant formation pathway, suggested by the other Kepler CBPs. In this paper, we consider the possibility of an undetected planet near the stability limit by examining observational consequences of such a planet. We calculate the transit probability of the putative planet, transit timing variations (TTVs) of the known planet, and eclipsing timing variations (ETVs) of the host binary caused by the putative planet. We find the presence of a $\gtrsim$30M$_{\oplus}$ inner planet to be highly unlikely near the stability limit. In addition, we provide future TTV observation windows, which will further constrain possible undetected planets with lower masses.","Ziqian Hong, Billy Quarles, Gongjie Li, Jerome A.

384,"We study temporal variations of the emission lines of Halpha, Hepsilon, H and K Ca II, D1 and D2 Na I, 4026 and 5876 A He I in the HARPS spectra of Proxima Centauri across an extended time of 13.2 years, from May 27, 2004, to September 30, 2017.   Aims. We analyse the common behaviour and differences in the intensities and profiles of different emission lines in flare and quiet modes of Proxima activity.   Methods. We compare the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEW) and profiles of the emission lines in the HARPS high-resolution (R ~ 115,000) spectra observed at the same epochs.   Results. All emission lines show variability with a timescale of at least 10 min. The strength of all lines except He I 4026 A correlate with \Halpha. During strong flares the `red asymmetry' appears in the Halpha emission line indicating the infall of hot condensed matter into the chromosphere with velocities greater than 100 km/s disturbing chromospheric layers. As a result, the strength of the Ca II lines anti-correlates with Halpha during strong flares. The He I lines at 4026 and 5876 A appear in the strong flares. The cores of D1 and D2 Na I lines are also seen in emission. During the minimum activity of Proxima Centauri, Ca II lines and Hepsilon almost disappear while the blue part of the Na I emission lines is affected by the absorption in the extending and condensing flows.   Conclusions. We see different behaviour of emission lines formed in the flare regions and chromosphere. Chromosphere layers of Proxima Cen are likely heated by the flare events; these layers are cooled in the `non-flare' mode. The self-absorption structures in cores of our emission lines vary with time due to the presence of a complicated system of inward and outward matter flows in the absorbing layers.","Ya. V.

PTAs are sensitive to the frequency band ranging just below 1 nanohertz to a few tens of microhertz. The discovery space of this band is potentially rich with populations of inspiraling supermassive black-holes binaries, decaying cosmic string networks, relic post-inflation GWs, and even non-GW imprints of axionic dark matter. This article aims to provide an understanding of the exciting open science questions in cosmology, galaxy evolution, and fundamental physics that will be addressed by the detection and study of GWs through PTAs. The focus of the article is on providing an understanding of the mechanisms by which PTAs can address specific questions in these fields, and to outline some of the subtleties and difficulties in each case. The material included is weighted most heavily towards the questions which we expect will be answered in the near-term with PTAs; however, we have made efforts to include most currently anticipated applications of nanohertz GWs.","Sarah Burke-Spolaor, Stephen R.

387,"This paper presents the proportional evolutionary time hypothesis, which posits that the mean time required for the evolution of complex life is a function of stellar mass. The ""biological available window"" is defined as the region of a stellar spectrum between 200 to 1200 nm that generates free energy for life. Over the $\sim$4 Gyr history of Earth, the total energy incident at the top of the atmosphere and within the biological available window is $\sim$10$^{34}$ J. The hypothesis assumes that the rate of evolution from the origin of life to complex life is proportional to this total energy, which would suggest that planets orbiting other stars should not show signs of complex life if the total energy incident on the planet is below this energy threshold. The proportional evolutionary time hypothesis predicts that late K- and M-dwarf stars (M < 0.7 M$_{\odot}$) are too young to host any complex life at the present age of the universe.

388,"Adding a light scalar degree of freedom to General Relativity often induces a fifth force whose magnitude is strongly constrained by laboratory experiments and solar system tests. The Vainshtein screening mechanism ensures that the effects of this supplementary force are suppressed in dense environments. However, the field solution of theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening is only known in spherically symmetric situations. In this article we examine in different configurations the two-body potential energy of pointlike particles in a specific $P(X)$ theory with Vainshtein screening. We use ideas borrowed from the Effective One-Body approach of Buonanno and Damour in order to restrict the form of the solution. Our results indicate that, even if Vainshtein screening is also fully active in the equal-mass case, the nonlinear dependance of the two-body energy on the mass ratio implies a violation of the Equivalence Principle.

390,"The fact that the spatial nonlocality of galaxy formation is controlled by some short length scale like the Lagrangian radius is the cornerstone of the bias expansion for large-scale-structure tracers. However, the first sources of ionizing radiation between $z\approx 15$ and $z\approx 6$ are expected to have significant effects on the formation of galaxies we observe at lower redshift, at least on low-mass galaxies. These radiative-transfer effects introduce a new scale in the clustering of galaxies, i.e. the finite distance which ionizing radiation travels until it reaches a given galaxy. This mean free path can be very large, of order $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. Consequently, higher-derivative terms in the bias expansion could turn out to be non-negligible even on these scales: treating them perturbatively would lead to a massive loss in predictivity and, for example, could spoil the determination of the BAO feature or constraints on the neutrino mass. Here, we investigate under what assumptions an explicit non-perturbative model of radiative-transfer effects can maintain the robustness of large-scale galaxy clustering as a cosmological probe.","Giovanni Cabass, Fabian Schmidt","33 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Follow-up observations by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) confirmed the association between 2HWC J1953+294 and DA 495 and found the TeV emission to be spatially coincident with the radio emission first reported in 1968. The detection of TeV gamma-rays from DA 495, along with past X-ray detection up to 10 keV, prompted high energy X-ray observations as part of the NuSTAR Galactic Legacy Survey. We present the results of these NuSTAR observations, combined with archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, and confirm the previous X-ray photon index of $\Gamma_{2-20 \rm\ keV} = 2.0 \pm 0.1$. We find no spectral cutoff up to 20 keV. With the spectral information for DA 495 extended to TeV gamma-rays, we were able to perform analytical modeling to test leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios. The leptonic models can explain the broadband emission, but also imply a diffuse X-ray nebula of similar extent to the radio and TeV nebulae, which cannot be confirmed by our observations. The hadronic models can simultaneously explain the spectrum and the spatial extent in all wavelengths; however, we need a very high magnetic field strength pervading the radio and TeV nebulae and a surprisingly high particle kinetic energy.

393,"We present results from the LymAn Continuum Escape Survey (LACES), a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program designed to characterize the ionizing radiation emerging from a sample of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 3.1$. As many show intense [O III] emission characteristic of $z>6.5$ star-forming galaxies, they may represent valuable low redshift analogs of galaxies in the reionization era. Using HST Wide Field Camera 3 / UVIS $F336W$ to image Lyman continuum emission, we investigate the escape fraction of ionizing photons in this sample. For 61 sources, of which 77% are spectroscopically confirmed and 53 have measures of [O III] emission, we detect Lyman continuum leakage in 20%, a rate significantly higher than is seen in individual continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies. We estimate there is a 98% probability that $\leq 2$ of our detections could be affected by foreground contamination. Fitting multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to take account of the varying stellar populations, dust extinctions and metallicities, we derive individual Lyman continuum escape fractions corrected for foreground intergalactic absorption. We find escape fractions of 15 to 60% for individual objects, and infer an average 20% escape fraction by fitting composite SEDs for our detected samples. Surprisingly however, even a deep stack of those sources with no individual $F336W$ detections provides a stringent upper limit on the average escape fraction of less than 0.5%. We examine various correlations with source properties and discuss the implications in the context of the popular picture that cosmic reionization is driven by such compact, low metallicity star-forming galaxies.","Thomas J.

394,"The degree of fractal substructure in molecular clouds can be quantified by comparing them with Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) surfaces or volumes. These fields are self-similar over all length scales and characterised by a drift exponent $H$, which describes the structural roughness. Given that the structure of molecular clouds and the initial structure of star clusters are almost certainly linked, it would be advantageous to also apply this analysis to clusters. Currently, the structure of star clusters is often quantified by applying $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis. $\mathcal{Q}$ values from observed targets are interpreted by comparing them with those from artificial clusters. These are typically generated using a Box-Fractal (BF) or Radial Density Profile (RDP) model. We present a single cluster model, based on FBM, as an alternative to these models. Here, the structure is parameterised by $H$, and the standard deviation of the log-surface/volume density $\sigma$. The FBM model is able to reproduce both centrally concentrated and substructured clusters, and is able to provide a much better match to observations than the BF model. We show that $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis is unable to estimate FBM parameters. Therefore, we develop and train a machine learning algorithm which can estimate values of $H$ and $\sigma$, with uncertainties. This provides us with a powerful method for quantifying the structure of star clusters in terms which relate to the structure of molecular clouds. We use the algorithm to estimate the $H$ and $\sigma$ for several young star clusters, some of which have no measurable BF or RDP analogue.","O. Lomax, M. L. Bates, A. P.

Two of the models are based on the original bag potential structure and three versions consider a harmonic oscillator potential to confine the quarks. The bag-like models also incorporate the pasta phase used to describe the inner crust of neutron stars. We show that the pasta phase always play a minor or negligible role in all studies. Moreover, while no clear correlation between the models that satisfy the GW170817 constraints and the slope of the symmetry energy is found, a clear correlation is observed between the slope and the fact that the cooling is fast or slow, i.e., fast (slow) cooling is related to higher (lower) values of the slope.

First, that it applies only to universal couplings, and second, that it is too narrow, i.e. it excludes models in which the acceleration can be shown to be induced by a genuine modification of gravity, for instance coupled dark energy with a universal coupling, the Hu-Sawicki f(R) model or, in the context of inflation, the Starobinski model. We then propose two new, more general, concepts in its place: force-acceleration and field-acceleration, which are also applicable in presence of non universal cosmologies. We illustrate their concrete application with two examples, among the modified gravity classes which are still in agreement with current data, i.e. f(R) models and coupled dark energy.","Luca Amendola, Valeria Pettorino",14 pages; small changes in an appendix,1905.06660v2,No journal ref found,Valeria Pettorino,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06660v2,2019-05-16 11:17:07+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Beyond self-acceleration: force- and fluid-acceleration,2019-05-17 14:57:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06660v2
397,"We measure the bivariate luminosity function (BLF) of galaxy pairs and use it to probe and characterize the galaxy-galaxy interaction between pair members. The galaxy pair sample is selected from the main galaxy sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and supplied with a significant number of redshifts from the LAMOST spectral and GAMA surveys. We find the BLFs depend on the projected distance $d_{\text{p}}$ between pair members. At large separation $d_{\text{p}} > 150 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF degenerates into a luminosity function (LF) of single galaxies, indicating few interactions between pair members. At $100 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 150 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF starts to show the correlation between pair members, in the sense that the shape of the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of one member galaxy starts to depend on the luminosity of the other member galaxy. Specifically, the CLF with a brighter companion has a steeper faint-end slope, which becomes even more significant at $50 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 100 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$. This behavior is consistent with the scenario, \textit{and also is the observational evidence}, that dynamic friction drives massive major merger pairs to merge more quickly. At close distance $d_{\text{p}} \leq 50 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, besides the merging time-scale effect, the BLF also shows an overall brightening of $\Delta M_r \geq 0.04$ mag, which reveals the enhanced star formation of the close-pair phase. By combining another statistical conclusion that the star formation rate of late-type galaxies in close pairs is enhanced at a level of about 40\%, we further conclude that the average starburst time-scale of close pairs is as long as 0.4 Gyr.","Shuai Feng, Shi-Yin Shen, Fang-Ting Yuan, A-Li Luo, Jian-Nan Zhang, Meng-Xin Wang, Xia Wang, Yin-Bi Li, Wen Hou, Yan-Xin Guo, Fang Zuo","19 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, resubmitted to ApJ after two round of

398,"In an earlier work [S. Kastha et al., PRD {\bf 98}, 124033 (2018)], we developed the {\it parametrized multipolar gravitational wave phasing formula} to test general relativity, for the non-spinning compact binaries in quasi-circular orbit. In this paper, we extend the method and include the important effect of spins in the inspiral dynamics. Furthermore, we consider parametric scaling of PN coefficients of the conserved energy for the compact binary, resulting in the parametrized phasing formula for non-precessing spinning compact binaries in quasi-circular orbit. We also compute the projected accuracies with which the second and third generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks as well as the planned space-based detector LISA will be able to measure the multipole deformation parameters and the binding energy parameters. Based on different source configurations, we find that a network of third-generation detectors would have comparable ability to that of LISA in constraining the conservative and dissipative dynamics of the compact binary systems. This parametrized multipolar waveform would be extremely useful not only in deriving the first upper limits on any deviations of the multipole and the binding energy coefficients from general relativity using the gravitational wave detections, but also for science case studies of next generation gravitational wave detectors.","Shilpa Kastha, Anuradha Gupta, K.

399,"High-resolution (0.""03 - 0.""09) (9 - 26 pc)) ALMA (100 - 350 GHz (3 - 0.8 mm)) and VLA 45 GHz measurements have been used to image continuum and spectral line emission from the inner region of the nearby infrared luminous galaxy IC 860. We detect compact (r=8-10 pc), luminous, mm continuum emission in the core of IC 860, with brightness temperatures $T_{\rm B}>$ 280 K. The 45 GHz continuum is equally compact, but fainter in flux. We suggest that the 3 to 0.8 mm continuum is opaque at mm-wavelengths, implying a very large H$_2$ column density $N$(H$_2$) of 1e26 cm-2, and that it emerges from hot dust with temperature $T_{\rm d} \sim 280$ K. Vibrationally excited lines of HCN $\nu_2$=1f J=4-3 and 3-2 (HCN-VIB) are seen in emission and resolved on scales of 40-50 pc. The HCN-VIB emission reveals a north-south nuclear velocity gradient with projected rotation velocities of v=100 kms$^{-1}$ at r=10 pc. The brightest HCN-VIB emission is oriented perpendicular to the velocity gradient. Ground state lines of HCN 3-2, 4-3, HC$^{15}$N 4-3, HCO$^+$ 3-2, 4-3 and CS 7-6, show complex line absorption and emission features. HCN and HCO$^+$ have red-shifted, reversed P-Cygni profiles consistent with gas inflows of $\sim$50 kms$^{-1}$. The absorption features can be traced from the north-east into the nucleus. In contrast, CS 7-6 shows blue-shifted line wings extending to -(150-180) kms$^{-1}$. We suggest that a dense and slow outflow is hidden behind a foreground layer of inflowing gas.   It appears that the centre of IC 860 is in a phase of rapid evolution where an inflow is building up the nuclear column density of gas. A slow, dense outflow may be signalling the onset of feedback. The inner, r=10 pc, IR luminosity can be powered by an accreting black hole and/or a compact starburst with a top-heavy initial mass function.","S. Aalto, S. Muller, S. KÃ¶nig, N. Falstad, J.

400,"Radio interferometers consisting of identical antennas arranged on a regular lattice permit fast Fourier transform beamforming, which reduces the correlation cost from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in the number of antennas to $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. We develop a formalism for describing this process and apply this formalism to derive a number of algorithms with a range of observational applications. These include algorithms for forming arbitrarily pointed tied-array beams from the regularly spaced Fourier-transform formed beams, sculpting the beams to suppress sidelobes while only losing percent-level sensitivity, and optimally estimating the position of a detected source from its observed brightness in the set of beams. We also discuss the effect that correlations in the visibility-space noise, due to cross-talk and sky contributions, have on the optimality of Fourier transform beamforming, showing that it does not strictly preserve the sky information of the $n^2$ correlation, even for an idealized array.

401,"The purpose of this work is to present an extensive grid of dynamical atmosphere and wind models for M-type AGB stars, covering a wide range of relevant stellar parameters. We used the DARWIN code, which includes frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics and a time-dependent description of dust condensation and evaporation, to simulate the dynamical atmosphere. The wind-driving mechanism is photon scattering on submicron-sized Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains. The grid consists of $\sim4000$ models, with luminosities from $L_\star=890\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$ to $L_\star=40000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$ and effective temperatures from 2200K to 3400K. For the first time different current stellar masses are explored with M-type DARWIN models, ranging from 0.75M$_\odot$ to 3M$_\odot$. The modelling results are radial atmospheric structures, dynamical properties such as mass-loss rates and wind velocities, and dust properties (e.g. grain sizes, dust-to-gas ratios, and degree of condensed Si). We find that the mass-loss rates of the models correlate strongly with luminosity. They also correlate with the ratio $L_*/M_*$: increasing $L_*/M_*$ by an order of magnitude increases the mass-loss rates by about three orders of magnitude, which may naturally create a superwind regime in evolution models. There is, however, no discernible trend of mass-loss rate with effective temperature, in contrast to what is found for C-type AGB stars. We also find that the mass-loss rates level off at luminosities higher than $\sim14000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$, and consequently at pulsation periods longer than $\sim800$ days. The final grain radii range from 0.25 micron to 0.6 micron. The amount of condensed Si is typically between 10% and 40%, with gas-to-dust mass ratios between 500 and 4000.","S. Bladh, S.

402,"We present a phenomenological method for predicting the number of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) that should be detected by upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) SKA1-MID Wide Band 1 and Medium-Deep band 2 surveys. We use the Fermi Blazar Sequence and mass estimates of Fermi FSRQs, and gamma-ray emitting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies, to model the radio emission of FSRQs as a function of mass alone, assuming a near-Eddington accretion rate, which is suggested by current quasar surveys at z > 6. This is used to determine the smallest visible black hole mass as a function of redshift in two competing cosmologies we compare in this paper: the standard LCDM model and the R_h=ct universe. We then apply lockstep growth to the observed black-hole mass function at $z=6$ in order to devolve that population to higher redshifts and determine the number of FSRQs detectable by the SKA surveys as a function of z. We find that at the redshifts for which this method is most valid, LCDM predicts ~30 times more FSRQs than R_h=ct for the Wide survey, and ~100 times more in the Medium-Deep survey. These stark differences will allow the SKA surveys to strongly differentiate between these two models, possibly rejecting one in comparison with the other at a high level of confidence.","Kyle Leaf, Fulvio Melia","8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

403,"We have constructed and calibrated a spherically-symmetric, spatially-dependent particle transport and emission code for young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). This code predicts the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation spectrum at different positions in a PWN, thus yielding the surface brightness vs. radius and hence the nebular size as function of energy. It also predicts the X-ray spectral index at different radii from the central pulsar, depending on the nebular B-field profile and particle transport properties. We apply the code to PWN G0.9+0.1 and fit these three functions concurrently, thus maximizing the constraining power of the data. We use a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to find best-fit parameters with accompanying errors. This approach should allow us to better probe the spatial behaviour of the bulk-particle motion, the $B$-field and diffusion coefficient, and break degeneracies between different model parameters.

404,"We consider the propagation of a neutrino in a background composed of a scalar particle and a fermion using a simple model for the coupling of the form $\lambda\bar f_R\nu_L\phi$. In the presence of these interactions there can be damping terms in the neutrino effective potential and index of refraction. We calculate the imaginary part of the neutrino self-energy in this case, from which the damping terms are determined. The results are useful in the context of Dark Matter-neutrino interaction models in which the scalar and/or fermion constitute the dark-matter. The corresponding formulas for models in which the scalar particle couples to two neutrinos via a coupling of the form $\lambda^{(\nu\nu\phi)}\bar\nu^c_R\nu_L\phi$ are then obtained as a special case, which can be important also in the context of neutrino collective oscillations in a supernova and in the Early Universe hot plasma before neutrino decoupling. A particular feature of our results is that the damping term in a $\nu\phi$ background is independent of the antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry in the background. Therefore, the relative importance of the damping term may be more significant if the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the background is small, because the leading $Z$-exchange and $\phi$-exchange contributions to the effective potential, which are proportional to the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry, are suppressed in that case, while the damping term is not.","JosÃ© F.

405,"A variational Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution can be an excellent way to infer posterior quantities. However, to capture all posterior correlations the parametrization of the full covariance is required, which scales quadratic with the problem size. This scaling prohibits full-covariance approximations for large-scale problems. As a solution to this limitation we propose Metric Gaussian Variational Inference (MGVI). This procedure approximates the variational covariance such that it requires no parameters on its own and still provides reliable posterior correlations and uncertainties for all model parameters. We approximate the variational covariance with the inverse Fisher metric, a local estimate of the true posterior uncertainty. This covariance is only stored implicitly and all necessary quantities can be extracted from it by independent samples drawn from the approximating Gaussian. MGVI requires the minimization of a stochastic estimate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence only with respect to the mean of the variational Gaussian, a quantity that scales linearly with the problem size. We motivate the choice of this covariance from an information geometric perspective. We validate the method against established approaches, demonstrate its scalability into the regime over a million parameters and capability to capture posterior distributions over complex models with multiple components and strongly non-Gaussian prior distributions.","Jakob KnollmÃ¼ller, Torsten A.

Some years ago the authors extensively studied it and performed several VLBI observations from which they obtained mas-resolution maps of the SiO (7 mm) and H2O (1.3 cm) maser emissions. H2O masers were found to be distributed in two areas along the symmetry axis of the nebulae oriented nearly north-south delineating a bipolar outflow and their astrometric positions were accurately measured. SiO masers, indicating the position of the Mira component of the binary system, form a structure perpendicular to the axis of the nebulae. The general picture of the source looked satisfactory, except for the relative position of the two masers. Surprisingly, SiO masers, were tentatively placed 250 mas away (370 AU) from the apparent center of the outflow. Using the ALMA we observed the SiO maser emission at 86 GHz and accurately derived the position of the Mira component.

407,"Recently, Bartelmann et al. presented a 'Kinetic Field Theory' (KFT) formalism to tackle the difficulties of large scale structure formation. In this approach, the dynamics of a non-equilibrium ensemble of classical particles are examined based on methods of statistical field theory. So far, only contributions coming from dark matter were considered, which is assumed to pose an accurate description of our universe on very large scales. Nevertheless, going to smaller scales, also baryonic contributions have to be taken into account. Building on the ideas of Viermann et al. we present an effective particle model of hydrodynamics to describe baryonic matter in a cosmological framework. Using this model, the baryonic density contrast power spectrum is computed to lowest perturbative order within the resummed KFT framework of Lilow et al. We discuss the qualitative differences to the dark matter case and perform a quantitative comparison to the baryonic spectrum obtained from Eulerian perturbation theory. A subsequent paper will resolve the problem of coupling both theories describing dark and baryonic matter, respectively, to gain a full model of cosmic matter. Even though our focus is on cosmological systems only, we want to emphasize that all methods presented here are of a quite general fashion, making it applicable also to other fields.","Daniel Geiss, Robert Lilow, Felix Fabis, Matthias Bartelmann","24 pages, 2 figures, current version: added more explanatory material

This approach requires high (mountain) altitudes and very high surface coverage particle detectors. While in general the properties of air showers are well established for many decades, the extreme situation of ground-level detection of very small showers from low energy primaries has not yet been well characterised for the purposes of gamma-ray astronomy. Here we attempt such a characterisation, with the aim of supporting the optimisation of next-generation gamma-ray observatories based on this technique.

411,"We present three-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic numerical simulations of driven Alfv\'{e}n-wave turbulence of relevance to the collisionless near-Earth solar wind. Special attention is paid to the spectral transition that occurs near the ion-Larmor scale and to the origins of preferential perpendicular ion heating and of non-thermal wings in the parallel distribution function. Several novel diagnostics are used to show that the ion heating rate increases as the kinetic-Alfv\'{e}n-wave fluctuations, which comprise the majority of the sub-ion-Larmor turbulent cascade, attain near-ion-cyclotron frequencies. We find that ${\approx}75$-$80\%$ of the cascade energy goes into heating the ions, broadly consistent with the near-Earth solar wind. This heating is accompanied by clear velocity-space signatures in the particle energization rates and the distribution functions, including a flattened core in the perpendicular-velocity distribution and non-Maxwellian wings in the parallel-velocity distribution. The latter are attributed to transit-time damping and the pitch-angle scattering of perpendicularly heated particles into the parallel direction. Accompanying these features is a steepening of the spectral index of sub-ion-Larmor magnetic-field fluctuations beyond the canonical $-2.8$, as field energy is transferred to thermal energy. These predictions may be tested by measurements in the near-Earth solar wind.","Lev Arzamasskiy, Matthew W. Kunz, Benjamin D. G.

412,"We apply two methods to estimate the 21~cm bispectrum from data taken within the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) project of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Using data acquired with the Phase II compact array allows a direct bispectrum estimate to be undertaken on the multiple redundantly-spaced triangles of antenna tiles, as well as an estimate based on data gridded to the $uv$-plane. The direct and gridded bispectrum estimators are applied to 21 hours of high-band (167--197~MHz; $z$=6.2--7.5) data from the 2016 and 2017 observing seasons. Analytic predictions for the bispectrum bias and variance for point source foregrounds are derived. We compare the output of these approaches, the foreground contribution to the signal, and future prospects for measuring the bispectra with redundant and non-redundant arrays. We find that some triangle configurations yield bispectrum estimates that are consistent with the expected noise level after 10 hours, while equilateral configurations are strongly foreground-dominated. Careful choice of triangle configurations may be made to reduce foreground bias that hinders power spectrum estimators, and the 21~cm bispectrum may be accessible in less time than the 21~cm power spectrum for some wave modes, with detections in hundreds of hours.","Cathryn M.

413,"NSVS 14256825 is the second sdOB + dM eclipsing binary systems with an orbital period of 2.65 hours. The special binary was reported to contain circumbinary planets or brown dwarfs by using the timing method. However, different results were derived by different authors because of the insufficient coverage of eclipse timings. Since 2008, we have monitored this binary for about 10 years by using several telescopes and 84 new times of light minimum in high precision were obtained. It is found that the O-C curve is increasing recently and it shows a cyclic variation with a period of 8.83 years and amplitude of 46.31 seconds. The cyclic change cannot be explained by magnetic activity cycles of the red-dwarf component because the required energy is much larger than that radiated by this component in one whole period. This cyclic change detected in NSVS1425 could be explained by the light-travel time effect via the presence of a third body. The lowest mass of the third body is determined as 14.15 $M_{jup}$ that is in the transition between planets and brown dwarfs. The substellar object is orbiting around this evolved binary at an orbital separation around 3 AU with an eccentricity of 0.12. These results indicate that NSVS 14256825 is the first sdOB-type eclipsing binary consisting of a hierarchical substellar object. The detection of a close-in substellar companion to NSVS 14256825 will provide some insights on the formation and evolution of sdOB-type binaries and their companions.","Zhu L. -Y., Qian S. -B., Fernandez Lajus, E., Wang Z. -H., Li L. -J","13 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in RAA",1904.11664v3,No journal ref found,Li L. -J,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11664v3,2019-04-26 03:58:13+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.EP,A Close-in Substellar Object Orbiting the sdOB-type Eclipsing-Binary   System NSVS14256825,2019-05-17 08:24:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11664v3
414,"The thermal emission of transneptunian objects (TNO) and Centaurs has been observed at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths - with the biggest contributions coming from the Spitzer and Herschel space observatories-, and the brightest ones also at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. These measurements allowed to determine the sizes and albedos for almost 180 objects, and densities for about 25 multiple systems. The derived very low thermal inertias show evidence for a decrease at large heliocentric distances and for high-albedo objects, which indicates porous and low-conductivity surfaces. The radio emissivity was found to be low ($\epsilon_r$=0.70$\pm$0.13) with possible spectral variations in a few cases. The general increase of density with object size points to different formation locations or times. The mean albedos increase from about 5-6% (Centaurs, Scattered-Disk Objects) to 15% for the Detached objects, with distinct cumulative albedo distributions for hot and cold classicals. The color-albedo separation in our sample is evidence for a compositional discontinuity in the young Solar System. The median albedo of the sample (excluding dwarf planets and the Haumea family) is 0.08, the albedo of Haumea family members is close to 0.5, best explained by the presence of water ice. The existing thermal measurements remain a treasure trove at times where the far-infrared regime is observationally not accessible.","Thomas MÃ¼ller, Emmanuel Lellouch, Sonia Fornasier","Review chapter in ""The Trans-Neptunian Solar System"" (D.

417,"We study the prospects for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to find new dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way. Adopting models of Milky-Way halo substructure and phenomenological prescriptions connecting subhalos and satellite galaxies, we obtain surface brightness distributions of $V$-band magnitude that lead us to predict that LSST will discover tens to hundreds of dwarf spheroidal galaxies above its sensitivity. The soon-to-be-discovered dwarfs will be interesting targets for indirect searches of dark matter annihilation yields. We forecast the distribution function of gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation in these objects, and discuss the detectability of these signals at both Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). By combining information from the predicted dwarf galaxies, we obtain an expected sensitivity to the annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of $10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ (for dark matter particles of mass 10 GeV with Fermi-LAT) and $5\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ (for dark matter particles of mass 500 GeV with CTA).

Baryonic matter at central parts of galaxies acts as a boundary condition for dark matter wave equation and influences stellar rotation velocities in halos.

The implementation of this network would permit measurement of the solar system's tidal gravity field to high precision, thereby revealing the existence of distant trans-Neptunian objects such as the proposed ""Planet Nine."" As a detailed example of the network capabilities, we investigate how occultations by Jovian Trojans can be monitored to track the accumulation of gravitational perturbations, thereby constraining the presence of undetected massive solar system bodies. We also show that the tidal influence of Planet Nine can be discerned from that of smaller, nearer objects in the Kuiper belt. Moreover, ephemerides for all small solar system bodies observed in occultation could be significantly improved using this network, thereby improving spacecraft navigation and refining Solar System modeling. Finally, occultation monitoring would generate direct measurements of size distributions for asteroid populations, permitting a better understanding of their origins.","Malena Rice, Gregory Laughlin","Accepted for publication in AJ. 24 pages, 14 figures",1905.06354v2,No journal ref found,Gregory Laughlin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06354v2,2019-05-15 18:00:31+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.IM,The Case for a Large-Scale Occultation Network,2019-05-17 04:34:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06354v2
420,"There are several on-going projects to detect a number of stars orbiting around invisible objects. A fraction of them may be a triple system consisting of an inner binary black hole (BBH) and an outer orbiting star. In this paper, we propose a methodology to search for a signature of the inner BBH, possibly a progenitor of gravitational wave sources recently detected by LIGO, from the precise radial velocity follow-up of the outer star. For simplicity and definiteness, we focus on a coplanar and near-circular three-body system and derive analytic perturbation formulae of the orbital elements for the outer star. This formula will be useful in designing a follow-up radial velocity observation to search for an invisible BBH. As a specific example, we consider the 2M05215658+4359220 system of a red giant orbiting around an unseen object. The resulting constraint reveals that if the unseen companion is indeed a BBH of roughly equal masses, its orbital period should be less than a couple of weeks. Future radial-velocity monitoring of the system for a week will either strengthen the constraint or even detect a signature of the inner BBH. A similar velocity modulation, however, may be produced by a planet around the outer star as well. Thus we consider the degeneracy between the inner BBH and planet-star interpretations as well. In either case, short-cadence follow-up monitoring of a star-black binary system in future offers an interesting possibility to search for otherwise invisible BBHs.","Toshinori Hayashi, Shijie Wang, Yasushi Suto","21 pages, 17 figures",1905.07100v1,No journal ref found,Yasushi Suto,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07100v1,2019-05-17 03:15:48+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR|gr-qc,A strategy to search for an inner binary black hole from the motion of   the tertiary star I: a perturbative analytic approach to a coplanar and   near-circular three-body system and its application to 2M05215658+4359220,2019-05-17 03:15:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07100v1
421,"We present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for predicting whether an active region (AR) would produce a gamma-class flare within the next 24 hours. We consider three gamma classes, namely >=M5.0 class, >=M class, and >=C class, and build three LSTM models separately, each corresponding to a gamma class. Each LSTM model is used to make predictions of its corresponding gamma-class flares. The essence of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use LSTMs to capture temporal information of the data samples. Each data sample has 40 features including 25 magnetic parameters obtained from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products as well as 15 flare history parameters. We survey the flare events that occurred from 2010 May to 2018 May, using the GOES X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and select flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. These flare events are used to build the labels (positive vs. negative) of the data samples. Experimental results show that (i) using only 14-22 most important features including both flare history and magnetic parameters can achieve better performance than using all the 40 features together; (ii) our LSTM network outperforms related machine learning methods in predicting the labels of the data samples. To our knowledge, this is the first time that LSTMs have been used for solar flare prediction.","Hao Liu, Chang Liu, Jason T. L.

422,"Using recent compilations of detailed X-ray observations and spectral models of exceptional quality, we record the electron cyclotron resonance absorption (ECRA) features that have been detected in 45 pulsating high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources harboring neutron stars, although seven of these detections are still questionable and another 21 are single and/or not independently confirmed. From the comprehensive catalogs of Jaisawal \& Naik and Staubert et al. and from several additional recent observations, we produce two lists of HMXB ECRA sources: a list of 17 sources in which multiple ECRA lines or single very low-energy lines are seen, in which we can reasonably assume that the lowest energy reveals the fundamental cyclotron level for each source; and a `contaminated' list of 38 sources including the 21 detections of single ECRA lines that may (not) be higher-level harmonics. Both lists confirm a previous result that we have obtained independently by modeling the propeller lines of Magellanic HMXB pulsars: the surface dipolar magnetic fields $B_*$ of HMXB neutron stars are segregated around five distinct values with $B_* = 0.28\pm 0.08, 0.55\pm 0.11, 1.3\pm 0.37, 3.0\pm 0.68$, and $7.9\pm 3.1$, in units of TG. An explanation of this phenomenon is currently lacking. We have found no correlation between these $B_*$ values and the corresponding observed spin periods, spin period derivatives, orbital periods, maximum X-ray luminosities, neutron star masses, or companion star masses.","Dimitris M.

423,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will offer the first opportunity to characterize terrestrial exoplanets with sufficient precision to identify high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and TRAPPIST-1's seven known transiting Earth-sized planets are particularly favorable targets. To assist community preparations for JWST, we use simulations of plausible post-ocean-loss and habitable environments for the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and test simulations of all bright object time series spectroscopy modes and all MIRI photometry filters to determine optimal observing strategies for atmospheric detection and characterization using both transmission and emission observations. We find that transmission spectroscopy with NIRSpec Prism is optimal for detecting terrestrial, CO2 containing atmospheres, potentially in fewer than 10 transits for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, if they lack high altitude aerosols. If the TRAPPIST-1 planets possess Venus-like H2SO4 aerosols, up to 12 times more transits may be required to detect atmospheres. We present optimal instruments and observing modes for the detection of individual molecular species in a given terrestrial atmosphere and an observational strategy for discriminating between evolutionary states. We find that water may be prohibitively difficult to detect in both Venus-like and habitable atmospheres due to its presence lower in the atmosphere where transmission spectra are less sensitive. Although the presence of biogenic O2 and O3 will be extremely challenging to detect, abiotically produced oxygen from past ocean loss may be detectable for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets via O2-O2 collisionally-induced absorption at 1.06 and 1.27 microns, or via NIR O3 features for the outer three planets.

424,"We are now on a clear trajectory for improvements in exoplanet observations that will revolutionize our ability to characterize their atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation, from gas giants to rocky planets. However, exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that serve as critical inputs to atmospheric physical and chemical tools.

Now is the ideal time for progress in these areas, but this progress requires better access to, understanding of, and training in the production of spectroscopic data as well as a better insight into chemical reaction kinetics both thermal and radiation-induced at a broad range of temperatures.

425,"A star approaching a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be torn apart in a tidal disruption event (TDE). We examine ultra-deep TDEs, a new regime in which the disrupted debris approaches close to the black hole's Schwarzschild radius, and the leading part intersects the trailing part at the first pericenter passage. We calculate the range of penetration factors $\beta$ vs SMBH masses $M$ that produce these prompt self-intersections using a Newtonian analytic estimate and a general relativistic (GR) geodesic model. We find that significant self-intersection of Solar-type stars requires $\beta \sim 50 - 127$ for $M/M_\odot = 10^4$, down to $\beta \sim 5.6 - 5.9$ for $M/M_\odot = 10^6$. We run smoothed-particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations to corroborate our calculations and find close agreement, with a slightly shallower dependence on $M$. We predict that the shock from the collision emits an X-ray flare lasting $t \sim 2$ s with $L \sim 10^{47}$ ergs/s at $E \sim 2$ keV, and the debris has a prompt accretion episode lasting $t \sim$ several min.

426,"Centaurus A (Cen~A) is the nearest active radio galaxy, which has kiloparsec (kpc) scale jets and {giant lobes detected by various instruments in radio and X-ray frequency ranges}. The $Fermi$--Large Area Telescope and High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) confirmed, that Cen~A is a very high-energy (VHE; $> 0.1$~TeV) $\gamma$-ray emitter with a known spectral {softening} in the energy range from a few GeV to TeV. In this work, we consider a synchrotron self-Compton model in the nucleus for the broad band spectrum {below the break energy} and an external Compton model in kpc-scale jets for the $\gamma$-ray excess. Our results show that the observed $\gamma$-ray excess can be suitably described by the inverse Compton scattering of the starlight photons in the kpc-scale jets, which is consistent with the recent tentative report by the HESS on the spatial extension of the TeV emission along the jets. Considering the spectral fitting results, the excess can only be seen in Cen~A, which is probably due to two factors: (1) the host galaxy is approximately 50 times more luminous than other typical radio galaxies and (2) the core $\gamma$-ray spectrum quickly decays above a few MeV due to the low maximum electron Lorentz factor of $\gamma_{\rm c}=2.8 \times 10^3$ resulting from the large magnetic field of 3.8~G in the core. By the comparison with other $\gamma$-ray detected radio galaxies, we found that the magnetic field strength of relativistic jets scales with the distance from the central black holes $d$ with $B (d) \propto d^{-0.88 \pm 0.14}$.","Kazuhisa Tanada, Jun Kataoka, Yoshiyuki Inoue","9 pages, 4 figures",1905.07055v1,No journal ref found,Yoshiyuki Inoue,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07055v1,2019-05-16 23:00:08+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Inverse Compton scattering of starlight in the kiloparsec-scale jet in   Centaurus A: The origin of excess TeV $Î³$-ray emission,2019-05-16 23:00:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07055v1
427,"CMB lensing from current and upcoming wide-field CMB experiments such as AdvACT, SPT-3G and Simons Observatory relies heavily on temperature (vs. polarization). In this regime, foreground contamination to the temperature map produces significant lensing biases, which cannot be fully controlled by multi-frequency component separation, masking or bias hardening. In this letter, we split the standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of optimal ""multipole"" estimators. On large scales, these multipole estimators reduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and a new shear B-mode estimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and extragalactic foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be approximately immune to extragalactic foregrounds. We build a new method to compute separately and without noise the primary, secondary and trispectrum biases to CMB lensing from foreground simulations. Using this method, we demonstrate that the shear estimator is indeed insensitive to extragalactic foregrounds, even when applied to a single-frequency temperature map contaminated with CIB, tSZ, kSZ and radio point sources. This dramatic reduction in foreground biases allows us to include higher temperature multipoles than with the standard quadratic estimator, thus increasing the total lensing signal-to-noise beyond the quadratic estimator. In addition, magnification-only and shear B-mode estimators provide useful diagnostics for potential residuals. Our Python code LensQuEst to forecast the signal-to-noise of the various estimators, generate mock maps, lense them, and apply the various lensing estimators to them is publicly available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst .","Emmanuel Schaan, Simone Ferraro","New ""multipole"" estimators, code available at

428,"The advent of new deep+wide photometric lensing surveys will open up the possibility of direct measurements of the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies. The HSC wide survey will be the first with the statistical capability of measuring the lensing signal with high signal-to-noise at log(M*)=8. At this same mass scale, LSST will have the most overall constraining power with a predicted signal-to-noise for the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal around dwarfs of SN=200. WFIRST and LSST will have the greatest potential to push below the log(M*) = 7 mass scale thanks to the depth of their imaging data. Studies of the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies at z=0.1 with gravitational lensing are soon within reach. However, further work will be required to develop optimized strategies for extracting dwarfs samples from these surveys, determining redshifts, and accurately measuring lensing on small radial scales. Dwarf lensing will be a new and powerful tool to constrain the halo masses and inner density slopes of dwarf galaxies and to distinguish between baryonic feedback and modified dark matter scenarios.","Alexie Leauthaud, Sukhdeep Singh, Yifei Luo, Felipe Ardila, Johnny P.

429,"Carbon stars (with C/O> 1) were long assumed to all be giants, because only AGB stars dredge up significant carbon into their atmospheres. The case is nearly iron-clad now that the formerly mysterious dwarf carbon (dC) stars are actually far more common than C giants, and have accreted carbon-rich material from a former AGB companion, yielding a white dwarf and a dC star that has gained both significant mass and angular momentum. Some such dC systems have undergone a planetary nebula phase, and some may evolve to become CH, CEMP, or Ba giants. Recent studies indicate that most dCs are likely from older, metal-poor kinematic populations. Given the well-known anti-correlation of age and activity, dCs would not be expected to show significant X-ray emission related to coronal activity. However, accretion spin-up might be expected to rejuvenate magnetic dynamos in these post mass-transfer binary systems. We describe our Chandra pilot study of six dCs selected from the SDSS for Halpha emission and/or a hot white dwarf companion, to test whether their X-ray emission strength and spectral properties are consistent with a rejuvenated dynamo. We detect all 6 dCs in the sample, which have X-ray luminosities ranging from logLx= 28.5 - 29.7, preliminary evidence that dCs may be active at a level consistent with stars that have short rotation periods of several days or less. More definitive results require a sample of typical dCs with deeper X-ray observations to better constrain their plasma temperatures.","Paul J.

430,"Wide-orbit exoplanets are starting to be detected, and planetary formation models are under development to understand their properties. We propose a population of ""Oort"" planets around other stars, forming by a mechanism analogous to how the Solar System's Oort cloud of comets was populated. Gravitational scattering among planets is inferred from the eccentricity distribution of gas-giant exoplanets measured by the Doppler technique. This scattering is thought to commence while the protoplanetary disk is dissipating, $10^6-10^7$ yr after formation of the star, or perhaps soon thereafter, when the majority of stars are expected to be part of a natal cluster. Previous calculations of planet-planet scattering around isolated stars have one or more planets spending $10^4-10^7$ yr at distances >100 AU before ultimately being ejected. During that time, a close flyby of another star in the cluster may dynamically lift the periastron of the planet, ending further scattering with the inner planets. We present numerical simulations demonstrating this mechanism as well as an analysis of the efficiency. We estimate an occurrence of planets between 100 and 5000 AU by this mechanism to be <1% for gas giants and up to a few percent for Neptunes and super-Earths.","Nora Bailey, Daniel Fabrycky","15 pages, 11 figures, submitted to AJ",1905.07044v1,No journal ref found,Daniel Fabrycky,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07044v1,2019-05-16 21:41:18+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Stellar Flybys Interrupting Planet-Planet Scattering Generates Oort   Planets,2019-05-16 21:41:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07044v1
431,"We measure the void probability function (VPF) of galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The VPF provides complementary information to standard two-point statistics in that it is sensitive to galaxy bias in the most extreme underdensities in the cosmic web. Thus the VPF is ideal for testing whether halo occupation of galaxies depends on large-scale density, an effect known as galaxy assembly bias. We find that standard HOD model---one parameterized by halo mass only---fit only to the two-point function, accurately predicts the VPF. Additionally, for HOD models where density dependence is explicitly incorporated, the best-fit models fit to the combination of the correlation function and the VPF have zero density dependence. Thus galaxy assembly bias is not a strong source of systematic uncertaintiy when modeling the clustering of massive galaxies.","Kilian Walsh, Jeremy Tinker","11 pages, 7 figures",1905.07024v1,No journal ref found,Jeremy Tinker,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07024v1,2019-05-16 20:24:08+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,Probing Galaxy Assembly Bias in BOSS Galaxies Using Void Probabilities,2019-05-16 20:24:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07024v1
432,"The discovery of a transient kilonova following the gravitational-wave event GW170817 highlighted the critical need for coordinated rapid and wide-field observations, inference, and follow-up across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Southern hemisphere, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4-m telescope is well-suited to this task, as it is able to cover wide-fields quickly while still achieving the depths required to find kilonovae like the one accompanying GW170817 to $\sim$500 Mpc, the binary neutron star horizon distance for current generation of LIGO/Virgo collaboration (LVC) interferometers. Here, as part of the multi-facility followup by the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration, we describe the observations and automated data movement, data reduction, candidate discovery, and vetting pipeline of our target-of-opportunity DECam observations of S190426c, the first possible neutron star--black hole merger detected via gravitational waves. Starting 7.5hr after S190426c, over 11.28\,hr of observations, we imaged an area of 525\,deg$^2$ ($r$-band) and 437\,deg$^2$ ($z$-band); this was 16.3\% of the total original localization probability and nearly all of the probability density visible from the Southern hemisphere. The machine-learning based pipeline was optimized for fast turnaround, delivering transient candidates for human vetting within 17 minutes, on average, of shutter closure. We reported nine promising counterpart candidates 2.5 hours before the end of our observations. Our observations yielded no detection of a bona fide counterpart to $m_z = 22.5$ and $m_r = 22.9$ at the 5$\sigma$ level of significance, consistent with the refined LVC positioning.

433,"The high-quality OmegaCAM photometry of the 3x3 deg around the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) in r, and i filters by Beccari et al.(2017) revealed three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The objects belonging to the individual sequences are concentrated towards the center of the ONC. The authors concluded that there are two competitive scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries and triples with an exotic mass ratio distribution, or three stellar populations with different ages. We use Gaia DR2 in combination with the photometric OmegaCAM catalog to test and confirm the presence of the putative three stellar populations. We also study multiple stellar systems in the ONC for the first time using Gaia DR2. We confirm that the second and third sequence members are more centrally concentrated towards the center of the ONC. In addition we find an indication that the parallax and proper motion distributions are different among the members of the stellar sequences. The age difference among stellar populations is estimated to be 1-2 Myr. We use Gaia measurements to identify and remove as many unresolved multiple system candidates as possible. Nevertheless we are still able to recover two well-separated sequences with evidence for the third one, supporting the existence of the three stellar populations. We were able to identify a substantial number of wide binary objects (separation between 1000-3000 au). This challenges previously inferred values that suggested no wide binary stars exist in the ONC. Our inferred wide-binary fraction is approx 5%. We confirm the three populations correspond to three separated episodes of star formation. Based on this result, we conclude that star formation is not happening in a single burst in this region.

434,"The chiral magnetic effect is a phenomenon that an electric current parallel to the magnetic fields is induced in the presence of the chiral asymmetry in the fermionic system. In this article we point out that the electric current induced by the dynamics of a pseudo scalar field that anomalously couples to electromagnetic fields can be interpreted as a similar effect in the scalar system. Noting that the velocity of the pseudo scalar field, which is the phase of a complex scalar, represents that the system carries a global U(1) number asymmetry, we see that the induced current is proportional to the asymmetry and parallel to the magnetic field, which is the same to the chiral magnetic effect. We discuss that in a mechanism like the Affleck-Dine mechanism an asymmetry carried by the Affleck-Dine field can induce the electric current and give rise to the instability in the (electro)magnetic field if it is unbroken by the expectation value of the Affleck-Dine field. Cosmological consequences of this mechanism, which is similar to the chiral plasma instability, is investigated.","Kohei Kamada, Chang Sub Shin",33 pages,1905.06966v1,No journal ref found,Chang Sub Shin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06966v1,2019-05-16 18:00:14+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|hep-th,Magnetogenesis from rotating scalar: Ã  la scalar chiral magnetic   effect,2019-05-16 18:00:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06966v1
435,"The estimate of the number and space density of obscured AGN over cosmic time still represents an open issue. While the obscured AGN population is a key ingredient of the X-ray background synthesis models and is needed to reproduce its shape, a complete census of obscured AGN is still missing. Here we test the selection of obscured sources among the local 12-micron sample of Seyfert galaxies. Our selection is based on a difference up to three orders of magnitude in the ratio between the AGN bolometric luminosity, derived from the spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition, and the same quantity obtained by the published XMM-Newton 2-10 keV luminosity.   The selected sources are UGC05101, NGC1194 and NGC3079 for which the available X-ray wide bandpass, from Chandra and XMM-Newton plus NuSTAR data, extending to energies up to ~30-45 keV, allows us an accurate determination of the column density, and hence of the true intrinsic power.   The newly derived NH values clearly indicate heavy obscuration (about 1.2, 2.1 and 2.4 x10^{24} cm-2 for UGC05101, NGC1194 and NGC3079, respectively) and are consistent with the prominent silicate absorption feature observed in the Spitzer-IRS spectra of these sources (at 9.7 micron rest frame).

436,"We present an investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability using axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations near the equator of a differentially rotating radiation zone. This instability may provide an important contribution to angular momentum transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq Cartesian shearing box model, which represents a small patch of a differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations are also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial direction. The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric instability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability. This is no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability behaves nonlinearly in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations -- and those in 3D with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction -- quickly develop strong jets along the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to predator-prey-like temporal dynamics. In 3D, the instability initially produces homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport, though in some cases jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a simple theory for nonlinear saturation of the GSF instability and its resulting angular momentum transport. This theory is straightforward to implement in stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation. We estimate that the GSF instability could contribute towards explaining the missing angular momentum transport required in red giant stars, and play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline.","Adrian J.

437,"In order to better understand how active galactic nuclei (AGN) effect the interstellar media of their host galaxies, we perform a meta-analysis of the CO emission for a sample of $z=0.01-4$ galaxies from the literature with existing CO detections and well-constrained AGN contributions to the infrared (67 galaxies). Using either Spitzer/IRS mid-IR spectroscopy or Spitzer+Herschel colors we determine the fraction of the infrared luminosity in each galaxy that can be attributed to heating by the AGN or stars. We calculate new average CO spectral line ratios (primarily from Carilli \& Walter 2013) to uniformly scale the higher-$J$ CO detections to the ground state and accurately determine our sample's molecular gas masses. We do not find significant differences in the gas depletion timescales/star formation efficiencies (SFEs) as a function of the mid-infrared AGN strength ($f_{\rm AGN}({\rm MIR})$ or $L_{\rm IR} ({\rm AGN})$), which indicates that the presence of an IR-bright AGN is not a sufficient sign-post of galaxy quenching. We also find that the dust-to-gas ratio is consistent for all sources, regardless of AGN emission, redshift, or $L_{\rm IR}$, indicating that dust is likely a reliable tracer of gas mass for massive dusty galaxies (albeit with a large degree of scatter).

We derive two-dimensional stellar-mass distributions that are inferred from spatial mass-to-light ratio (M/L) corrections based on rest-frame optical colors. Due to the high central column densities of dust in our SMGs, our mass distributions likely represent a lower limit to the true central mass density. The centroid positions between the inferred stellar-mass and the dust distributions agree within 1.1 kpc, indicating an overall good spatial agreement between the two components. The majority of our sources exhibit compact dust configurations relative to the stellar component (with a median ratio of effective radii Re,dust/Re,Mstar = 0.6). This ratio does not change with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) over the factor of 30 spanned by our targets, sampling the locus of ""normal"" main sequence galaxies up to the starburst regime, log(sSFR/sSFRMS) > 0.5.

439,"We present a deep learning model trained to emulate the radiative transfer during the epoch of cosmological reionization. CRADLE (Cosmological Reionization And Deep LEarning) is an autoencoder convolutional neural network that uses two-dimensional maps of the star number density and the gas density field at z=6 as inputs and that predicts 3D maps of the times of reionization $\mathrm{t_{reion}}$ as outputs. These predicted single fields are sufficient to describe the global reionization history of the intergalactic medium in a given simulation. We trained the model on a given simulation and tested the predictions on another simulation with the same paramaters but with different initial conditions. The model is successful at predicting $\mathrm{t_{reion}}$ maps that are in good agreement with the test simulation. We used the power spectrum of the $\mathrm{t_{reion}}$ field as an indicator to validate our model. We show that the network predicts large scales almost perfectly but is somewhat less accurate at smaller scales. While the current model is already well-suited to get average estimates about the reionization history, we expect it can be further improved with larger samples for the training, better data pre-processing and finer tuning of hyper-parameters. Emulators of this kind could be systematically used to rapidly obtain the evolving HII regions associated with hydro-only simulations and could be seen as precursors of fully emulated physics solvers for future generations of simulations.","Jonathan Chardin, GrÃ©goire Uhlrich, Dominique Aubert, Nicolas Deparis, Nicolas Gillet, Pierre Ocvirk, Joseph Lewis","11 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1905.06958v1,No journal ref found,Joseph Lewis,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06958v1,2019-05-16 18:00:02+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,A deep learning model to emulate simulations of cosmic reionization,2019-05-16 18:00:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06958v1

The sources are Herschel-selected, having stellar masses M*>10^10Msun and SFR (100-1000Msun/yr) elevated(>4?) above the star-forming ""main sequence"", classifying them as Starbursts (SB). Through a multiwavelength fitting approach (including a dusty torus component), we divided the sample into active SBs (dominated by an AGN emission, SBs-AGN, ? 23% of the sample) and purely star-forming SBs (SBs-SFR). We visually inspected their HST/UV-restframe maps: SBs-SFR are generally irregular and composite systems; ? 50% of SBs-AGN are instead dominated by regular compact morphologies. We then found archival ALMA continuum counterparts for 33 galaxies (12 SBs-AGN and 21 SBs-SFR). For these sources we computed dust masses, and, with standard assumptions, we also guessed total molecular gas-masses. SBs turn to be gas rich systems (fgas = Mgas=Mgas/(Mgas+M*) \sim 20%-70%), and the gas fractions of the two SB classes are very similar (fgas = 43 +/-4% and fgas = 42+/- 2%). Our results show that SBs are consistent with a mixture of: 1) highly star-forming merging systems (dominating the SBs-SFR), and 2) primordial galaxies, rapidly growing their M* together with their Black Hole (mainly the more compact SBs-AGN). Anyway, feedback effects have not reduced their fgas yet. Indeed, SBs at z = 2, with relatively low bolometric AGN luminosities in the range 10^44 < Lbol(AGN) < 10^46 erg/s (compared to bright optical and X-ray quasars), are still relatively far from the epoch when the AGN feedback will quench the SFR in the host and will substantially depress the gas fractions.","G.

441,"We present high-resolution ALMA observations of the C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0 isotopologues in 3 nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGS; Arp 220, IRAS 13120-5453, IRAS 17208-0014) and 1 nearby post-merger galaxy (NGC 2623). In all 4 systems, we measure high $^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O and $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO integrated line ratios while the $^{13}$CO/C$^{18}$O ratio is observed to be extremely low in comparison to typical star-forming disks, supporting previous work. We investigate whether these unusual line ratios are due to dynamical effects, astrochemistry within the gas, or nucleosynthesis in stars. Assuming both lines are optically thin, low $^{13}$CO/C$^{18}$O values suggest that C$^{18}$O is more abundant than $^{13}$CO in the interstellar medium of these systems. A plausible explanation is that local ULIRGs and their progeny have an excess in massive star formation; in other words, they are producing a top-heavy stellar initial mass function.","Toby Brown, Christine Wilson","10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.06950v1,No journal ref found,Christine Wilson,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06950v1,2019-05-16 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Extreme CO Isotopologue Line Ratios in ULIRGS: Evidence for a top-heavy   IMF,2019-05-16 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06950v1
442,"Many existing and proposed experiments targeting QCD axion dark matter (DM) can also search for a broad class of axion-like particles (ALPs). We analyze the experimental sensitivities to electromagnetically-coupled ALP DM in different cosmological scenarios with the relic abundance set by the misalignment mechanism. We obtain benchmark DM targets for the standard thermal cosmology, a pre-nucleosynthesis period of early matter domination, and a period of kination. These targets are theoretically simple and assume $\mathcal{O}(1)$ misalignment angles, avoiding fine-tuning of the initial conditions. We find that some experiments will have sensitivity to these ALP DM targets before they are sensitive to the QCD axion, and others can potentially reach interesting targets below the QCD band. The ALP DM abundance also depends on the origin of the ALP mass. Temperature-dependent masses that are generated by strong dynamics (as for the QCD axion) correspond to DM candidates with smaller decay constants, resulting in even better detection prospects.","Nikita Blinov, Matthew J.

443,"Mapping the intergalactic medium (IGM) in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission would yield unprecedented tomographic information on the large-scale distribution of baryons and potentially provide new constraints on the UV background and various feedback processes relevant for galaxy formation. Here, we examine the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of the moderate-density IGM due to collisional excitations and recombinations in the presence of a UV background in the Sherwood simulation suite. We focus on large-scale-structure filaments in which Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects are expected to be moderate. At low density the emission is primarily due to fluorescent re-emission of the ionising UV background due to recombinations, while collisional excitations dominate at higher densities. We discuss prospects of current and future observational facilities to detect this emission and focus on VLT/MUSE for a more detailed sensitivity analysis. We construct mock MUSE observations resembling the MUSE Hubble Deep Field South from our simulations and show that our predictions are consistent with recent analyses of diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission using MUSE at redshifts $3 < z < 6$. We find that it should be most feasible to detect the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from filaments in the IGM in overdense regions, somewhat surprisingly towards the high-redshift end ($z \gtrsim 4.5$) accessible by MUSE, and if narrowband widths close to the MUSE spectral resolution limit are used. This is due to the higher densities and lower temperatures in the IGM at higher redshift. High-redshift protoclusters therefore appear to be the ideal environment to observe filamentary structures in the IGM in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission.","Joris Witstok, Ewald Puchwein, Girish Kulkarni, Renske Smit, Martin G.

444,"We present a method for deriving the electron density of ionized gas using the ratio of the intensity of the [NII] 205um line to that of a Hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL). We use this method to derive electron densities of 21 velocity components in 11 lines of sight, including the Galactic center. We observed, at high--spectral resolution, the [NII] 205um with the Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT instruments and the radio recombination lines with the Green Bank Telescope and the NASA Deep Space Network Deep Space Station 43 (DSS-43) telescope. We find typical electron densities between 6 to 170 cm^{-3}, which are consistent with those derived at low spectral resolution using the [NII] 205um/122um ratio with Herschel/PACS on a larger sample of sight lines in the Galactic plane. By matching the electron densities derived from the [NII] 205um/RRL intensity ratio and the [NII] 122um/205um intensity ratio, we derive the nitrogen fractional abundance for our velocity components. We investigate the dependence of the N/H ratio with Galactocentric distance in the inner Galaxy (R_gal<6kpc), which is inaccessible in optical studies due to dust extinction. We find that the distribution of nitrogen abundances in the inner galaxy derived from our data has a slope that is consistent to that found in the outer Galaxy in optical studies. This result is inconsistent with some suggestions of a flatter distribution of the nitrogen abundance in the inner galaxy.","Jorge L. Pineda, Shinji Horiuchi, L. D. Anderson, Matteo Luisi, Paul F.

445,"Baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) is naturally explained with $K^0-K^{0'}$ oscillations of a newly developed mirror-matter model and new understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions. A consistent picture for the origin of both BAU and dark matter is presented with the aid of $n-n'$ oscillations of the new model. The global symmetry breaking transitions in QCD are proposed to be staged depending on condensation temperatures of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks in the early universe. The long-standing BAU puzzle can then be understood with $K^0-K^{0'}$ oscillations that occur at the stage of strange quark condensation and baryon number violation via a non-perturbative instanton-like (coined ""quarkiton"") process. Similar processes at charm, bottom, and top quark condensation stages are also discussed including an interesting idea for top quark condensation to break both the QCD global $U_t(1)_A$ symmetry and the electroweak gauge symmetry at the same time.

446,"We present very faint dropout galaxies at z~6-9 with a stellar mass M* down to M*~10^6Mo that are found in deep optical/near-infrared (NIR) images of the full data sets of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program in conjunction with deep ground-based and Spitzer images and gravitational lensing magnification effects. We investigate stellar populations of the HFF dropout galaxies with the optical/NIR photometry and BEAGLE models made of self-consistent stellar population synthesis and photoionization models, carefully including strong nebular emission impacting on the photometry. We identify 357 galaxies with M*~10^6-10^9Mo, and find that a stellar mass to UV luminosity L_UV ratio M*/L_UV is nearly constant at M*~10^6-10^9Mo. Our best-estimate M*/L_UV function is comparable to a model of star-formation duration time of 100 Myr, but 2-7 times higher than the one of 10 Myr assumed in a previous study (at the 5sigma level) that would probably underestimate M* of faint galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) at z~6-9 that agree with those obtained by previous studies with no M*/L_UV assumptions at M*>~10^8Mo, and that extends to M*~10^6Mo. Estimating the stellar mass densities rho* with the GSMFs, we find that rho* smoothly increases from log(rho*/[Mo Mpc^(-3)])=5.91 +0.75/-0.65 at z~9 to 6.21 +0.39/-0.37 at z~6-7, which is consistent with the one estimated from star-formation rate density measurements. In conjunction with the estimates of the galaxy effective radii R_e on the source plane, we have pinpointed two objects with low stellar masses (M*<=10^7Mo) and very compact morphologies (R_e<=40 physical pc) that are comparable with those of globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way today. These objects are candidates of star clusters that should be a part or a dominant component of high-redshift low-mass galaxy, some of which may be related to GCs today.","Shotaro Kikuchihara, Masami Ouchi, Yoshiaki Ono, Ken Mawatari, Jacopo Chevallard, Yuichi Harikane, Takashi Kojima, Masamune Oguri, Gustavo Bruzual, Stephane Charlot",No comment found,1905.06927v1,No journal ref found,Stephane Charlot,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06927v1,2019-05-16 17:40:57+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Early Low-Mass Galaxies and Star-Cluster Candidates at z~6-9 Identified   by the Gravitational Lensing Technique and Deep Optical/Near-Infrared Imaging,2019-05-16 17:40:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06927v1
447,"We have examined gas engaged in noncircular motions in 22 of the nearby LITTLE THINGS dwarf irregular galaxies. The HI data cubes have been deconvolved into kinematic components - bulk rotation and noncircular motions, to produce maps of integrated gas, velocity field, and velocity dispersion in the different components. We found significant regions of gas engaged in noncircular motions in half of the galaxies, involving 1%-20% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. In one galaxy we found a pattern in the velocity field that is characteristic of streaming motions around the stellar bar potential and star formation at the end of bar. Two galaxies have large-scale filamentary structures found in their outer disks, and these filaments could be transient instabilities in the gas. We found no spatial correlation between noncircular motion gas and enhanced star formation.

448,"We consider the simplest anisotropic generalization, as a correction, to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, by replacing the spatially flat Robertson-Walker metric by the Bianchi type-I metric, which brings in a new term $\Omega_{\sigma 0}a^{-6}$ (mimicking the stiff fluid) in the average expansion rate $H(a)$ of the Universe. From Hubble and Pantheon data, relevant to the late Universe ($z\lesssim 2.4$), we obtain the constraint $\Omega_{\sigma0}\lesssim10^{-3}$, in line with the model independent constraints. When the baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data are included, the constraint improves by 12 orders of magnitude, i.e., $\Omega_{\sigma0}\lesssim10^{-15}$. We find that this constraint could alter neither the matter-radiation equality redshift nor the peak of the matter perturbations. Demanding that the expansion anisotropy has no significant effect on the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), we find the constraint $\Omega_{\sigma0}\lesssim10^{-23}$. We show explicitly that the constraint from BBN renders the expansion anisotropy irrelevant to make a detectable change in the CMB quadrupole temperature, whereas the constraint from the cosmological data provides the temperature change up to $\sim11\;\mu \rm K$.","Ozgur Akarsu, Suresh Kumar, Shivani Sharma, Luigi Tedesco","13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables",1905.06949v1,No journal ref found,Luigi Tedesco,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06949v1,2019-05-16 16:52:21+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Constraints on Bianchi type-I spacetime extension of the standard   $Î$CDM model,2019-05-16 16:52:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06949v1
449,"We present a novel fitting formula for the halo concentration enhancement in chameleon $f(R)$ gravity relative to General Relativity (GR). The formula is derived by employing a large set of $N$-body simulations of the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model which cover a wide range of model and cosmological parameters, resolutions and simulation box sizes. The complicated dependence of the concentration on halo mass $M$, redshift $z$, and the $f(R)$ and cosmological parameters can be combined into a simpler form that depends only on a rescaled mass $M/10^{p_2}$, with $p_2\equiv1.5\log_{10}\left[|{\bar{f}_R(z)}|/(1+z)\right]+21.64$ and $\bar{f}_R(z)$ the background scalar field at $z$, irrespective of the $f(R)$ model parameter. Our fitting formula can describe the concentration enhancement well for redshifts $z\leq3$, nearly 7 orders of magnitude in $M/10^{p_2}$ and five decades in halo mass. This is part of a series of works which aims to provide a general framework for self-consistent and unbiased tests of gravity using present and upcoming galaxy cluster surveys. The fitting formula, which is the first quantitative model for the concentration enhancement due to chameleon type modified gravity, is an important part in this framework and will allow continuous exploration of the parameter space. It can also be used to model other statistics such as the matter power spectrum.","Myles A.

We implement an automatic umbra extraction method and compute the ratio over eight solar cycles (Cycles 16-23). Although the average ratio doesn't show any variation with spot latitudes, cycle phases and strengths, it increases from 5.5 to 6 as the sunspot size increases from 100 $\mu$hem to 2000 $\mu$hem. Interestingly, our analysis also reveals that this ratio for smaller sunspots (area $<$ 100 $\mu$hem) does not have any long-term systematic trend which was earlier reported from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (RGO) photographic results. To verify the same, we apply our automated extraction technique on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) continuum images (1996-2010).

451,"Superconducting nanowires are widely used as sensitive single photon detectors with wide spectral coverage and high timing resolution. We describe a demonstration of an array of DC biased superconducting nanowire single photon detectors read out with a microwave multiplexing circuit. In this design, each individual nanowire is part of a resonant LC circuit where the inductance is dominated by the kinetic inductance of the nanowire. The circuit also contains two parallel plate capacitors, one of them is in parallel with the inductor and the other is coupled to a microwave transmission line which carries the signals to a cryogenic low noise amplifier. All of the nanowires are connected via resistors to a single DC bias line that enables the nanowires to be current biased close to their critical current. When a photon hits a nanowire it creates a normal hot spot which produces a voltage pulse across the LC circuit. This pulse rings down at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit over a time period that is fixed by the quality factor. We present measurements of an array of these devices and an evaluation of their performance in terms of frequency and time response.","A. K. Sinclair, E. Schroeder, D. Zhu, M. Colangelo, J.

The highlight of our proposal is to rewrite the slow-roll parameters in terms of $f(R)$, which allows to find directly $n_{\rm s}$, $r$, $\alpha_{\rm s}$ and $f^{\text{equil}}_{\text{NL}}$ as functions of $R$ itself.

453,"Observational studies of star formation reveal spatial distributions of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that are `snapshots' of an ongoing star formation process. Using methods from spatial statistics it is possible to test the likelihood that a given distribution process could produce the observed patterns of YSOs. The aim of this paper is to determine the usefulness of the spatial statistics tests Diggle's G function (G), the `free-space' function (F), Ripley's K and O-ring for application to astrophysical data. The spatial statistics tests were applied to simulated data containing 2D Gaussian clusters projected on random distributions of stars. The number of stars within the Gaussian cluster and number of background stars were varied to determine the tests' ability to reject complete spatial randomness (CSR) with changing signal-to-noise. The best performing test was O-ring optimised with overlapping logarithmic bins, closely followed by Ripley's K. The O-ring test is equivalent to the 2-point correlation function. Both F and G (and the minimum spanning tree, of which G is a subset) performed significantly less well, requiring a cluster with a factor of two higher signal-to-noise in order to reject CSR consistently.

In order to investigate their exact composition, we developed a data-driven methodology that can generate a synthetic photometric signature and spectrum of a single star. By combining multiple such synthetic stars into an unresolved binary or triple system and comparing the results to the actual photometric and spectroscopic observations, we uncovered 6 definitive triple stellar system candidates and an additional 14 potential candidates whose combined spectrum mimics the Solar spectrum. Considering the volume correction factor for a magnitude limited survey, the fraction of probable unresolved triple stars with long orbital periods is ~2 %.

458,"Chemical compositions of exoplanets can provide key insights into their physical processes, and formation and evolutionary histories. Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a direct avenue to probe exoplanetary compositions. However, whether obtained in transit or thermal emission, spectroscopic observations probe limited pressure windows of planetary atmospheres and are directly sensitive to only a limited set of spectroscopically active species. It is therefore critical to have chemical models that can relate retrieved atmospheric compositions to an atmosphere's bulk physical and chemical state. To this end we present LEVI, a new chemical kinetics code for modelling exoplanetary atmospheres. LEVI calculates the gas phase hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen chemistry in planetary atmospheres. Here we focus on hot gas giants. Applying LEVI, we investigate how variations in bulk C/O and N/O affects the observable atmospheric chemistry in hot Jupiters. For typical hot Jupiters we demonstrate the strong sensitivity of molecular detections to the atmospheric C/O. Molecular detections are conversely less sensitive to the atmospheric N/O ratio, although highly super-solar N/O can decrease the C/O required for HCN and NH3 detection. Using a new P-T profile for HD 209458b without a thermal inversion, we evaluate recently reported detection's of CO, H2O and HCN in its day-side atmosphere. We find that our models are consistent with the detected species, albeit with a narrow compositional window around C/O $\sim$ 1. A C/O $\gtrsim$ 0.9 (1.6 times solar) was required to meet the minimum reported value for HCN, while a C/O $\lesssim$ 1 (1.8 times solar) was required to fit the nominal H2O abundance.","R. Hobbs, O.

459,"We report on a search for high-energy counterparts to fast radio bursts (FRBs) with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). We find no significant associations for any of the 23 FRBs in our sample, but report upper limits to the high-energy fluence for each on timescales of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 s. We report lower limits on the ratio of the radio to high-energy fluence, $\frac{f_{r}}{f_{\gamma}}$, for timescales of 0.1 and 100 s. We discuss the implications of our non-detections on various proposed progenitor models for FRBs, including analogs of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar and hyperflares from magnetars. This work demonstrates the utility of analyses of high-energy data for FRBs in tracking down the nature of these elusive sources.","Virginia Cunningham, S.

In this work, we present the first measurement of the average shower profile in traversed atmospheric depth at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The shapes of profiles are well reproduced by the Gaisser-Hillas parametrization within the range studied, for E > 10^{17.8} eV. A detailed analysis of the systematic uncertainties is performed using 10 years of data and a full detector simulation. The average shape is quantified using two variables related to the width and asymmetry of the profile, and the results are compared with predictions of hadronic interaction models for different primary particles.","The Pierre Auger Collaboration, A.

461,"We use the Equation of State (EoS) approach to study the evolution of the dark sector in Horndeski models, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of motion. By including the effects of the dark sector into our code EoS\_class, we demonstrate the numerical stability of the formalism and excellent agreement with results from other publicly available codes for a range of parameters describing the evolution of the function characterising the perturbations for Horndeski models, $\alpha_{\rm x}$, with ${\rm x}=\{{\rm K}, {\rm B}, {\rm M}, {\rm T}\}$. After demonstrating that on sub-horizon scales ($k\gtrsim 10^{-3}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$) velocity perturbations in both the matter and the dark sector are typically subdominant with respect to density perturbations in the equation of state for perturbations, we find an attractor solution for the dark sector gauge-invariant density perturbation $\Delta_{\rm ds}$. Using this result, we provide simplified expressions for the equation-of-state functions: the dark sector entropy perturbations $w_{\rm ds}\Gamma_{\rm ds}$ and anisotropic stress $w_{\rm ds}\Pi_{\rm ds}$. From this we derive a growth factor-like equation for both matter and dark sector and are able to capture the relevant physics for several observables with great accuracy. We finally present new analytical expressions for the well-known modified gravity phenomenological functions $\mu$, $\eta$ and $\Sigma$ for a generic Horndeski model as functions of $\alpha_{\rm x}$. We show that on small scales they reproduce expressions presented in previous works, but on large scales, we find differences with respect to other works.","Francesco Pace, Richard A.

462,"I investigate the origin of arc degeneracies in satellite microlens parallax pi_E measurements with only late time data, e.g., t > t0 + t_E as seen from the satellite. I show that these are due to partial overlap of a series of osculating, exactly circular, degeneracies in the pi_E plane, each from a single measurement. In events with somewhat earlier data, these long arcs break up into two arclets, or (with even earlier data) two points, because these earlier measurmeents give rise to intersecting rather than osculating circles. The two arclets (or points) then constitute one pair of degeneracies in the well-known four-fold degeneracy of space-based microlens parallax. Using this framework of intersecting circles, I show that next-generation microlens satellite experiments could yield good pi_E determinations with only about five measurements per event, i.e., about 30 observations per day to monitor 1500 events per year.

464,"The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) recently observed 18 transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b. The sequence of transits occurred 81.6 $\pm$ 11.7 seconds earlier than had been predicted, based on data stretching back to 2007. This is unlikely to be the result of a clock error, because TESS observations of other hot Jupiters (WASP-6b, 18b, and 46b) are compatible with a constant period, ruling out an 81.6-second offset at the 6.4$\sigma$ level. The 1.3-day orbital period of WASP-4b appears to be decreasing at a rate of $\dot{P} = -12.6 \pm 1.2$ milliseconds per year. The apparent period change might be caused by tidal orbital decay or apsidal precession, although both interpretations have shortcomings. The gravitational influence of a third body is another possibility, though at present there is minimal evidence for such a body.

465,"Partial measurements of relative position are a relatively common event during the observation of visual binary stars. However, these observations are typically discarded when estimating the orbit of a visual pair. In this article we present a novel framework to characterize the orbits from a Bayesian standpoint, including partial observations of relative position as an input for the estimation of orbital parameters. Our aim is to formally incorporate the information contained in those partial measurements in a systematic way into the final inference. In the statistical literature, an imputation is defined as the replacement of a missing quantity with a plausible value. To compute posterior distributions of orbital parameters with partial observations, we propose a technique based on Markov chain Monte Carlo with multiple imputation. We present the methodology and test the algorithm with both synthetic and real observations, studying the effect of incorporating partial measurements in the parameter estimation. Our results suggest that the inclusion of partial measurements into the characterization of visual binaries may lead to a reduction in the uncertainty associated to each orbital element, in terms of a decrease in dispersion measures (such as the interquartile range) of the posterior distribution of relevant orbital parameters. The extent to which the uncertainty decreases after the incorporation of new data (either complete or partial) depends on how informative those newly-incorporated measurements are. Quantifying the information contained in each measurement remains an open issue.","Ruben M. Claveria, Rene A. Mendez, Jorge F. Silva, Marcos E.

467,"We analyze K2 light curves for 132 low-mass ($1\ \gtrsim\ M_*\ \gtrsim\ 0.1$~${M_{\odot}}$) members of the 600--800~Myr-old Hyades cluster and measure rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for 116 of these stars. These include 93 stars with no prior $P_{rot}$ measurement; the total number of Hyads with known $P_{rot}$ is now 232. We then combine literature binary data with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry to select single star sequences in the Hyades and its roughly coeval Praesepe open cluster, and derive a new reddening value of $A_V = 0.035$$\pm$$0.011$ for Praesepe. Comparing the effective temperature--$P_{rot}$ distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4~d slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This $P_{rot}$ difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun, and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57~Myr. However, this $P_{rot}$ difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars, and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular-momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages.","S.

469,"We perform forecasts for how baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from future spectroscopic emission line galaxy (ELG) surveys such as Euclid are degraded in the presence of spectral line misidentification. Using analytic calculations verified with mock galaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are degraded in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled correctly in the likelihood. Firstly, there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio for the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates to all cosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$. Secondly, degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters. In our calculations this typically increases BAO scale uncertainties at the 10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining the broadband power spectrum shape. External constraints on $f_c$, or parameters determining the shape of the power spectrum, for example from cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, can remove this effect. There is a near-perfect degeneracy between $f_c$ and the power spectrum amplitude for low $f_c$ values, where $f_c$ is not well determined from the contaminated sample alone. This has the potential to strongly degrade RSD constraints. The degeneracy can be broken with an external constraint on $f_c$, for example from cross-correlation with a separate galaxy sample containing the misidentified line, or deeper sub-surveys.","G. E.

470,"Recent balloon-borne and satellite experiments have established new features in the behavior of the spectra of cosmic rays. An analysis of all the data showed that hardening of most abundant primary cosmic ray nuclei spectra with increasing rigidity is observed in $>200$ GV region. At the same time, rigidity dependencies of secondary cosmic rays are distinctly different. The AMS-02 data show that above 200 GV the secondary cosmic rays Li, Be, B harden more than the primary He, C, O.   In this paper we discuss a new scenario that self-consistently describes these new features of the cosmic ray spectra. We demonstrate that the measured by the AMS-02 changes in the slope of the cosmic ray spectra caused by the transition from the contribution of multiple distant Galactic sources, including the nuclear interactions of the particles accelerated by these sources with an interstellar medium during their wandering in the Galaxy, to the contribution of mainly local ones. We also found that the spectral universality is observed at rigidity $R> 10^5$ GV.","A A Lagutin, N V Volkov, R I Raikin, A G Tyumentsev","8 pages, 4 figures, 26th Extended European Cosmic Ray Symposium",1905.06699v1,No journal ref found,A G Tyumentsev,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06699v1,2019-05-16 12:44:13+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Origin of hardening and universality of cosmic rays spectra in GV-PV   rigidity region,2019-05-16 12:44:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06699v1

472,"We discuss our VLA and VLBI observations of supernova 1986J, which is characterized by a compact radio-bright component within the expanding shell of ejecta. No other supernova (SN) has such a central component at cm wavelengths. The central component therefore provides a unique probe of the propagation of radio signals at cm wavelengths through the ejecta of a young SN. Such a probe is important in the context of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB), which, in many models, are thought to be produced by young magnetars or neutron stars. The FRB signals would therefore have to propagate through the expanding SN ejecta. Our observations of the Type II SN 1986J show that the ejecta would remain opaque to cm-wave emission like FRBs for at least several decades after the explosion, and by the time the ejecta have become transparent, the contribution of the ejecta to the dispersion measure is likely small.","Michael F.

474,"The Neutrino Astronomy seems to be finally discovered by a sudden flavor variations at several tens Tev and by the recent, but unique, correlation between the IceCube-170922A trough going muon track with the TXS 0506+056 gamma source. However, we believe that several expected signatures of a sharp Neutrino Astronomy are still absent. We discuss such puzzles regarding the last ICECUBE neutrino High Energy Starting Events (HESE) set. In this frame we note for energies greater than 90 TeV an intriguing paucity of downward HESE muon tracks respect to the corresponding up-going ones. This happened in the previous 82 events set and is still present in the last one of 103 events. Moreover, the rare (just one or two) downward HESE tracks are much less numerous respect to the corresponding more abundant downward showers. These missing HESE tracks are proposing either an up-down cosmic flavor anisotropy (or anomaly), or more realistically, an asymmetry due to the role of ICECUBE veto for all downward HESE tracks occurring with any nearby collinear muon companion. Companion muons that are absent for any astrophysical events. About the tau double bang absence or paucity we present a discussion on the nature of the detected tau events considering the last declared detector efficiency. In particular we underline the unprobable (few percent) statistical location of the energy of the two tau event candidates respect to the ICECUBE efficiency detection curve. We conclude that a dominant atmospheric charmed neutrino (with a marginal astrophysical component) may better fit all the ICECUBE data. It is proposed an approach that may found confirmations in the ICECUBE data with new disentangling technique or in the next upgoing or horizontal tau air-shower detectors and rate.","D. Fargion, P.

475,"When a star approaches a black hole closely, it may be pulled apart by gravitational forces in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The flares produced by TDEs are unique tracers of otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of most galaxies. In particular, the appearance of such flares and the subsequent decay of the light curve are both sensitive to whether the star is partially or totally destroyed by the tidal field. However, the physics of the disruption and the fall-back of the debris are still poorly understood. We are here modelling the hydrodynamical evolution of realistic stars as they approach a SMBH on parabolic orbits, using for the first time the moving-mesh code AREPO, which is particularly well adapted to the problem through its combination of quasi-Lagrangian behaviour, low advection errors, and high accuracy typical of mesh-based techniques. We examine a suite of simulations with different impact parameters, allowing us to determine the critical distance at which the star is totally disrupted, the energy distribution and the fallback rate of the debris, as well as the hydrodynamical evolution of the stellar remnant in the case of a partial disruption. Interestingly, we find that the internal evolution of the remnant's core is strongly influenced by persistent vortices excited in the tidal interaction. These should be sites of strong magnetic field amplification, and the associated mixing may profoundly alter the subsequent evolution of the tidally pruned star.","Felipe G.

476,"We present the results of new calculations of the energy spectra of cosmic ray electrons, positrons and also positron fraction under assumption that both electrons and positrons are generated by the same Galactic sources, which accelerate particles with same power-law injection spectral index $p$. The value of the injection index $p\approx 2.85$ retrieved in our works from the analysis of the observed CR spectra has been used. The propagation of particles through the highly non-homogeneous interstellar medium has been described by the anomalous diffusion model.   We show that proposed approach allows the self-consistent description of the recent AMS-02 data. In contrast to the conclusion made by AMS-02 collaboration about the different origin of the high-energy positrons and electrons, our results demonstrate that the differing behavior of spectral indices of electrons and positrons with energy can be described under the assumption that both positrons and electrons have common Galactic sources.

477,"We investigate how the dark energy properties impact the constraints on the total neutrino mass in interacting dark energy (IDE) models. In this study, we focus on two typical interacting dynamical dark energy models, i.e., the interacting $w$ cold dark matter (I$w$CDM) model and the interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) model. To avoid the large-scale instability problem in IDE models, we apply the parameterized post-Friedmann approach to calculate the perturbation of dark energy. We employ the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data, combined with low-redshift measurements on baryon acoustic oscillation distance scales, type Ia supernovae, and the Hubble constant, to constrain the cosmological parameters. We find that the dark energy properties could influence the constraint limits on the total neutrino mass. Once dynamical dark energy is considered in the IDE models, the upper bounds of $\sum m_\nu$ will be changed. By considering the values of $\chi^2_{\rm min}$, we find that in these IDE models the normal hierarchy case is slightly preferred over the inverted hierarchy case; for example, $\Delta\chi^2=2.720$ is given in the IHDE+$\sum m_\nu$ model. In addition, we also find that in the I$w$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ model $\beta=0$ is consistent with current observational data inside the 1$\sigma$ range, and in the IHDE+$\sum m_\nu$ model $\beta>0$ is favored at more than 2$\sigma$ level.","Lu Feng, Hai-Li Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang","9 pages, 3 figures",1903.08848v2,No journal ref found,Xin Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08848v2,2019-03-21 06:59:07+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph,Exploring neutrino mass and mass hierarchy in interacting dark energy   models,2019-05-16 11:28:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08848v2

These findings have implications for modelling progenitors of Type Ib and Type IIb supernovae.

479,"Fluid approximations to cosmic ray (CR) transport are often preferred to kinetic descriptions in studies of the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, because they allow simpler analytical and numerical treatments. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the ISM usually incorporate CR dynamics as an advection-diffusion equation for CR energy density, with anisotropic, magnetic field-aligned diffusion with the diffusive flux assumed to obey Fick's law. We compare test-particle and fluid simulations of CRs in a random magnetic field. We demonstrate that a non-Fickian prescription of CR diffusion, which corresponds to the telegraph equation for the CR energy density, can be easily calibrated to match the test particle simulations with great accuracy. In particular, we consider a random magnetic field in the fluid simulation that has a lower spatial resolution than that used in the particle simulation to demonstrate that an appropriate choice of the diffusion tensor can account effectively for the unresolved (subgrid) scales of the magnetic field. We show that the characteristic time which appears in the telegraph equation can be physically interpreted as the time required for the particles to reach a diffusive regime and we stress that the Fickian description of the CR fluid is unable to describe complex boundary or initial conditions for the CR energy flux.","L.

480,"Characterizing the properties of the host galaxies of merging compact objects provides essential clues to interpret current and future gravitational-wave detections. Here, we investigate the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), metallicity and colours of the host galaxies of merging compact objects in the local Universe, by combining the results of MOBSE population-synthesis models together with galaxy catalogs from the EAGLE simulation. We predict that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per galaxy ${\rm n}_{\rm GW}$ of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes (DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs). We find a significant correlation also between ${\rm n}_{\rm GW}$ and SFR. As a consequence, ${\rm n}_{\rm GW}$ correlates also with the $r-$band luminosity and with the $g-r$ colour of the host galaxies. Interestingly, $\gtrsim{}60$ %, $\gtrsim{}64$ % and $\gtrsim{}73$ % of all the DNSs, BHNSs and DBHs merging in the local Universe lie in early-type galaxies, such as NGC 4993. We predict a local DNS merger rate density of $\sim{}238~{\rm Gpc}^{-3}~{\rm yr}~^{-1}$ and a DNS merger rate $\sim{}16-121$ Myr$^{-1}$ for Milky Way-like galaxies. Thus, our results are consistent with both the DNS merger rate inferred from GW170817 and the one inferred from Galactic DNSs.","M. Celeste Artale, Michela Mapelli, Nicola Giacobbo, Nadeen B.

481,"We present an analytical model to study the dynamics of the outer edge of Saturn's A ring. The latter is influenced by 7:6 mean motion resonances with Janus and Epimetheus. Because of the horseshoe motion of the two co-orbital moons, the ring edge particles are alternately trapped in a corotation eccentricity resonance (CER) or a Lindblad eccentricity resonance (LER). However, the resonance oscillation periods are longer than the 4-year interval between the switches in the orbits of Janus and Epimetheus. Averaged equations of motion are used, and our model is numerically integrated to describe the effects of the periodic sweeping of the 7:6 CERs and LERs over the ring edge region. We show that four radial zones (ranges 136715-136723, 136738-136749, 136756-136768, 136783-136791 km) are chaotic on decadal timescales, within which particle semi-major axes have periodic changes due to partial libration motions around the CER fixed points. After a few decades, the maximum variation of semi-major axis is about 11 km (respectively 3 km) in the case of the CER with Janus (respectively Epimetheus). Similarly, particle eccentricities have partial oscillations forced by the LERs every 4 yr. For initially circular orbits, the maximum eccentricity reached is ~0.001. We apply our work to ""Peggy"", an object recently discovered at the ring edge, confirming that it is strongly perturbed by the Janus 7:6 LER. The CER has currently no effect on that body, nevertheless the fitted semi-major axes are just outside the chaotic zone of radial range 136756-136768 km.","N. C. S. Araujo, S. Renner, N. J.

482,"In March 2018, Mukherjee (2018) reported the detection by VERITAS of very-high-energy emission (VHE; > 100 GeV) from 3C 264. This is the sixth, and second most distant, radio galaxy ever detected in the TeV regime. In this article we present a radio and X-ray analysis of the jet in 3C 264. We determine the main physical parameters of the parsec-scale flow and explore the implications of the inferred kinematic structure for radiative models of this gamma-ray emitting jet. The radio data set is comprised of VLBI observations at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE program, and cover a time period of ~2 years. Through a segmented wavelet decomposition method we estimate the apparent displacement of individual plasma features; we then perform a pixel-based analysis of the stacked image to determine the jet shape. The X-ray data set includes all available observations from the Chandra, XMM, and Swift satellites, and is used, together with archival data in the other bands, to build the SED. Proper motion is mostly detected along the edges of the flow, which appears strongly limb-brightened. The apparent speeds increase as a function of distance from the core up to a maximum of ~$11.5$ c. This constrains the jet viewing angle to assume relatively small values ($\theta\lesssim10^{\circ}$). In the acceleration region, extending up to a de-projected distance of ~$4.8\times10^4$ Schwarzschild radii (~$11$ pc), the jet is collimating ($r\propto z^{0.40\pm 0.04}$), as predicted for a magnetically-driven plasma flow. By assuming that the core region is indeed magnetically dominated ($U_B/U_e>1$), the SED and the jet power can be well reproduced in the framework of leptonic models, provided that the high-energy component is associated to a second emitting region. The possibility that this region is located at the end of the acceleration zone, either in the jet layer or in the spine, is explored in the modeling.","B. Boccardi, G. Migliori, P. Grandi, E.

483,"Radiative turbulent mixing layers should be ubiquitous in multi-phase gas with shear flow. They are a potentially attractive explanation for the high ions such as OVI seen in high velocity clouds and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. We perform 3D MHD simulations with non-equilibrium (NEI) and photoionization modeling, with an eye towards testing simple analytic models. Even purely hydrodynamic collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) calculations have column densities much lower than observations. Characteristic inflow and turbulent velocities are much less than the shear velocity, and the layer width $h \propto t_\mathrm{cool}^{1/2}$ rather than $h \propto t_\mathrm{cool}$. Column densities are not independent of density or metallicity as analytic scalings predict, and show surprisingly weak dependence on shear velocity and density contrast. Radiative cooling, rather than Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, appears paramount in determining the saturated state. Low pressure due to fast cooling both seeds turbulence and sets the entrainment rate of hot gas, whose enthalpy flux, along with turbulent dissipation, energizes the layer. Regardless of initial geometry, magnetic fields are amplified and stabilize the mixing layer via magnetic tension, producing almost laminar flow and depressing column densities. NEI effects can boost column densities by factors of a few. Suppression of cooling by NEI or photoionization can in principle also increase OVI column densities, but in practice is unimportant for CGM conditions. To explain observations, sightlines must pierce hundreds or thousands of mixing layers, which may be plausible if the CGM exists as a `fog' of tiny cloudlets.","Suoqing Ji, S.

We propose a method to detect these effects (notably the orbital precession) based on measuring the successive eclipse and transit times of the exoplanet. In the case of HD 80606b, we find that in ten years (after approximately 33 periods) the instants of transits and eclipses are delayed with respect to the Newtonian prediction by about 3 minutes due to relativistic effects. These effects can be detected by comparing at different epochs the time difference between a transit and the preceding eclipse, and should be measurable by comparing events already observed on HD 80606 in 2010 with the Spitzer satellite together with those to be observed in the future with the James Webb Space Telescope.","Luc Blanchet, Guillaume HÃ©brard, FranÃ§ois Larrouturou","15 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics",1905.06630v1,No journal ref found,FranÃ§ois Larrouturou,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06630v1,2019-05-16 09:58:58+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|gr-qc,Detecting the General Relativistic Orbital Precession of the Exoplanet   HD 80606b,2019-05-16 09:58:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06630v1
485,"In the current paradigm, it is believed that the compact VLBI radio core of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNi) represents the innermost upstream regions of relativistic outflows. These regions of AGN jets have generally been modeled by a conical outflow with a roughly constant opening angle and flow speed. Nonetheless, some works suggest that a parabolic geometry would be more appropriate to fit the high energy spectral distribution properties and it has been recently found that, at least in some nearby radio galaxies, the geometry of the innermost regions of the jet is parabolic. We compile here multi-frequency core sizes of archival data to investigate the typically unresolved upstream regions of the jet geometry of a sample of 56 radio-loud AGNi. Data combined from the sources considered here are not consistent with the classic picture of a conical jet starting in the vicinity of the super-massive black hole (SMBH), and may exclude a pure parabolic outflow solution, but rather suggest an intermediate solution with quasi-parabolic streams, which are frequently seen in numerical simulations. Inspection of the large opening angles near the SMBH and the range of the Lorentz factors derived from our results support our analyses. Our result suggests that the conical jet paradigm in AGNi needs to be re-examined by millimeter/sub-millimeter VLBI observations.","Juan Carlos Algaba, Masanori Nakamura, Keiichi Asada, Sang Sung Lee","Proceedings for the 14th European VLBI Network Symposium & Users

Derived synchrotron self absorption magnetic fields, of the order of 0.1 mG, do not seem to dramatically change during the flares, and are much smaller, by a factor 10,000, than the estimated equipartition magnetic fields, indicating that the source of the flare may be associated with a particle dominated emitting region.","Juan Carlos Algaba, Sang Sung Lee, Bindu Rani, Dae-Won Kim, Motoki Kino, Jeffrey Hodgson, Guang-Yao Zhao, Do-Young Byun, Mark Gurwell, Sin-Cheol Kang, Jae-Young Kim, Jeong-Sook Kim, Soon-Wook Kim, Jongh-Ho Park, Sascha Trippe, Kiyoaki Wajima","Proceedings for the 14th European VLBI Network Symposium & Users

487,"The Cyg OB2 #5 system is thought to consist of a short-period (6.6 d) eclipsing massive binary orbited by an OB-star orbiting with a period of ~6.7 yr; these stars in turn are orbited by a distant early B-star with a period of thousands of years. However, while the inner binary has been studied many times, information is missing on the other stars, in particular the third star whose presence was indirectly postulated from recurrent modulations in the radio domain. Besides, to this date, the X-ray light curve could not be fully interpreted, for example in the framework of colliding-wind emission linked to one of the systems. We obtained new optical and X-ray observations of Cyg OB2 #5, which we combined to archival data. We performed a thorough and homogeneous investigation of all available data, notably revisiting the times of primary minimum in photometry. In the X-ray domain, XMM-Newton provides scattered exposures over ~5000 d whilst Swift provides a nearly continuous monitoring for the last couple of years. Although the X-ray light curve reveals clear variability, no significant period can be found hence the high-energy emission cannot be explained solely in terms of colliding winds varying along either the short or intermediate orbits. The optical data reveal for the first time clear signs of reflex motion. The photometry indicates the presence of a 2366 d (i.e. 6.5 yr) period while the associated radial velocity changes are detected at the 3 sigma level in the systemic velocity of the He II 4686 emission line. With the revised period, the radio light curve is interpreted consistently in terms of a wind interaction between the inner binary and the tertiary star. From these optical and radio data, we derive constraints on the physical properties of the tertiary star and its orbit.","Gregor Rauw, YaÃ«l NazÃ©, Fran Campos",Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics,1905.06617v1,No journal ref found,Fran Campos,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06617v1,2019-05-16 09:38:52+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.HE,Quest for the tertiary component in Cyg OB2 #5,2019-05-16 09:38:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06617v1
488,"In this article, we present an overview of the new developments in problems of the plasma influence on the effects of gravitational lensing, complemented by pieces of new material and relevant discussions. Deflection of light in the presence of gravity and plasma is determined by a complex combination of various physical phenomena: gravity, dispersion, refraction. In particular, the gravitational deflection itself, in a homogeneous plasma without refraction, differs from the vacuum one and depends on the frequency of the photon. In an inhomogeneous plasma, chromatic refraction also takes place. We describe chromatic effects in strong lens systems including a shift of angular position of image and a change in magnification. We also investigate high-order images that arise when lensing on a black hole surrounded by homogeneous plasma. The recent results of analytical studies of the effect of plasma on the shadow of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are presented.","Gennady S. Bisnovatyi-Kogan, Oleg Yu.

490,"We developed a new semi-analytic galaxy formation model: Galaxy Assembly with Binary Evolution (GABE). For the first time we introduce binary evolution into semi-analytic models of galaxy formation by using Yunnan-II stellar population synthesis model, which includes various binary interactions. When implementing our galaxy formation model onto the merger trees extracted from the Millennium simulation, it can reproduce a large body of observational results. We find that in the local universe the model including binary evolution reduces the luminosity at optical and infrared wavelengths slightly, while increases the luminosity at ultraviolet wavelength significantly, especially in $F_{\rm UV}$ band. The resulting luminosity function does not change very much over SDSS optical bands and infrared band, but the predicted colors are bluer, especially when $F_{\rm UV}$ band is under consideration. The new model allows us to explore the physics of various high energy events related to the remnants of binary stars, e.g. type Ia supernovae, short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events, and their relation with host galaxies in a cosmological context.","Zhen Jiang, Jie Wang, Liang Gao, Fenghui Zhang, Qi Guo, Lan Wang, Jun Pan","25 pages, 13 figures, accepted by Research in Astronomy and

RSP is a new functionality in MESAstar that models the non-linear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars. We significantly enhance numerical energy conservation capabilities, including during mass changes. For example, this enables calculations through the He flash that conserve energy to better than 0.001 %. To improve the modeling of rotating stars in MESA, we introduce a new approach to modifying the pressure and temperature equations of stellar structure, and a formulation of the projection effects of gravity darkening. A new scheme for tracking convective boundaries yields reliable values of the convective-core mass, and allows the natural emergence of adiabatic semiconvection regions during both core hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. We quantify the parallel performance of MESA on current generation multicore architectures and demonstrate improvements in the computational efficiency of radiative levitation. We report updates to the equation of state and nuclear reaction physics modules.

492,"We investigate large-scale inhomogeneity of dark energy in the bubble nucleation scenario of the universe. In this scenario, the present universe was created by a bubble nucleation due to quantum tunneling from a metastable ancestor vacuum, followed by a primordial inflationary era. During the bubble nucleation, supercurvature modes of some kind of a scalar field are produced, and remain until present without decaying; thus they can play a role of the dark energy, if the mass of the scalar field is sufficiently light in the present universe. The supercurvature modes fluctuate at a very large spatial scale, much longer than the Hubble length in the present universe. Thus they create large-scale inhomogeneities of the dark energy, and generate large-scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. This is a notable feature of this scenario, where quantum fluctuations of a scalar field are responsible for the dark energy. In this paper, we calculate imprints of the scenario on the CMB anisotropies through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and give observational constraints on the curvature parameter $\Omega_K$ and on an additional parameter $\epsilon$ describing some properties of the ancestor vacuum.","Yue Nan, Kazuhiro Yamamoto, Hajime Aoki, Satoshi Iso, Daisuke Yamauchi","14 pages, 5 figures, version accepted for publication in Phys.

493,"We present optical $I$-band light curves of the stars towards a star-forming region Cygnus OB7 from 17 nights photometric observations. The light curves are generated from a total of 381 image frames with very good photometric precision. From the light curves of 1900 stars and their periodogram analyses, we detect 31 candidate variables including five previously identified. 14 out of 31 objects are periodic and exhibit the rotation rates in the range of 0.15 to 11.60 days. We characterize those candidate variables using optical/infrared colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams. From spectral indices of the candidate variables, it turns out that four are probably Classical T-Tauri stars (CTTSs), rest remain unclassified from present data, they are possibly field stars or diskless pre-main sequence stars towards the region. Based on their location on the various colour-magnitude diagrams, the ages of two T Tauri Stars were estimated to be $\sim$ 5 Myr. The light curves indicate at least five of the periodic variables are eclipsing systems. The spatial distribution of young variable candidates on Planck 857 GHz (350 $\mu$m) and 2MASS $K_s$ images suggest that at least two of the CTTSs are part of the active star-forming cloud Lynds 1003.","Somnath Dutta, Soumen Mondal, Santosh Joshi, Ramkrishna Das","14 pages, 12 figures",1905.06574v1,No journal ref found,Ramkrishna Das,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06574v1,2019-05-16 07:37:14+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Optical Photometric Variable Stars towards Cygnus OB7,2019-05-16 07:37:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06574v1

495,"The composition and properties of interstellar silicate dust are not well understood. In X-rays, interstellar dust can be studied in detail by making use of the fine structure features in the Si K-edge. The features in the Si K-edge offer a range of possibilities to study silicon-bearing dust, such as investigating the crystallinity, abundance, and the chemical composition along a given line of sight. We present newly acquired laboratory measurements of the silicon K-edge of several silicate-compounds that complement our measurements from our earlier pilot study. The resulting dust extinction profiles serve as templates for the interstellar extinction that we observe. The extinction profiles were used to model the interstellar dust in the dense environments of the Galaxy. The laboratory measurements, taken at the Soleil synchrotron facility in Paris, were adapted for astrophysical data analysis and implemented in the SPEX spectral fitting program. The models were used to fit the spectra of nine low-mass X-ray binaries located in the Galactic center neighborhood in order to determine the dust properties along those lines of sight. Most lines of sight can be fit well by amorphous olivine. We also established upper limits on the amount of crystalline material that the modeling allows. We obtained values of the total silicon abundance, silicon dust abundance, and depletion along each of the sightlines. We find a possible gradient of $0.06\pm0.02$ dex/kpc for the total silicon abundance versus the Galactocentric distance. We do not find a relation between the depletion and the extinction along the line of sight.","S. T. Zeegers, E. Costantini, D. Rogantini, C. P. de Vries, H. Mutschke, P. Mohr, F. de Groot, A. G. G.

496,"We investigate the cosmological perturbations in the context of a Scalar-Tensor-Vector theory of Gravity known as MOG in the literature. Although MOG is plagued by ghosts, it does not suffer from tachyonic instability. Therefore it can be considered as a valid theory, at least in the classical limit. In the weak field limit, MOG increases the strength of gravity, and consequently addresses some astrophysical tests, without invoking dark matter particles. Recent investigations show that MOG reproduces a viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM. However, the matter dominated era is slightly faster in MOG compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper, in order to clarify whether this evolution is compatible with observations, we study the linear matter perturbations and estimate the relevant modified gravity parameters. In contrast to some current claims in the relevant literature, we show that MOG reduces the growth rate of the perturbations. We then compare MOG to the redshift space distortion (RSD) data. We find that MOG yields a much higher value than $\Lambda$CDM for the power spectrum parameter $\sigma_8$. Although MOG cannot yet be ruled out by RSD data alone, the low growth and high $\sigma_8$ constitute a powerful challenge to the cosmological viability of MOG.","Sara Jamali, Mahmood Roshan, Luca Amendola","22 pages, 6 figures and 1 table, Typos corrected, some discussions

498,"We report the discovery of large-amplitude mid-infrared variabilities (MIR; $\sim 0.3$ mag) in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 and W2 bands of the low-luminosity narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS 007, which exhibits prominent and varying broad-absorption lines (BALs) with blueshifted velocity up to $\rm \sim 14000\ km\ s^{-1}$. The observed significant MIR variability, the UV to optical color variabilities in the Swift bands that deviate from the predictions of pure dust attenuation models, and the fact that Swift light curves can be well fitted by the stochastic AGN variability model suggest that its observed flux variabilities in UV-optical-MIR bands should be intrinsic, rather than owing to variable dust extinction. Furthermore, the variations of BAL features (i.e., trough strength and maximum velocity) and continuum luminosity are concordant. Therefore, we propose that the BAL variability observed in WPVS 007 is likely induced by the intrinsic ionizing continuum variation, alternative to the rotating-torus model proposed in a previous work. The BAL gas in WPVS 007 might be in the low-ionization state as traced by its weak N V BAL feature; as the ionizing continuum strengthens, the Ci IV and Si IV column densities also increase, resulting in stronger BALs and the emergence of high-velocity components of the outflow. The outflow launch radius might be as small as $\sim 8 \times 10^{-4}$ pc under the assumption of being radiatively driven, but a large-scale origin (e.g., torus) cannot be fully excluded because of the unknown effects from additional factors, e.g., the magnetic field.","Junyao Li, Mouyuan Sun, Tinggui Wang, Zhicheng He, Yongquan Xue","12 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.06538v1,No journal ref found,Yongquan Xue,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06538v1,2019-05-16 05:49:26+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,On the Origin of the Dramatic Spectral Variability of WPVS 007,2019-05-16 05:49:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06538v1
499,"The interior composition of exoplanets is not observable, limiting our direct knowledge of their structure, composition, and dynamics. Recently described observational trends suggest that rocky exoplanets, that is, planets without significant volatile envelopes, are likely limited to $<$1.5 Earth radii. We show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely-rocky super-Earth exoplanets, the maximum expected core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature is relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the maximum central core pressure varies between 1.5 and 2.5 TPa. We further find that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are mostly a function of planet radius and insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent shock-compression experiments, ab-initio calculations, and planetary dynamical studies. We further show that the extrapolation of relevant equations of state does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these planets. Mass-radius models are more sensitive to bulk composition than any uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to TPa pressures.","Cayman T. Unterborn, Wendy R.

502,"We present here the cosmo-SLICS, a new suite of simulations specially designed for the analysis of current and upcoming weak lensing data beyond the standard two-point cosmic shear. We sample the $[\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, h, w_0]$ parameter space at 25 points organised in a Latin hyper-cube, spanning a range that contains most of the $2\sigma$ posterior distribution from ongoing lensing surveys. At each of these nodes we evolve a pair of $N$-body simulations in which the sampling variance is highly suppressed, and ray-trace the volumes 800 times to further increase the effective sky coverage. We extract a lensing covariance matrix from these pseudo-independent light-cones and show that it closely matches a brute-force construction based on an ensemble of 800 truly independent $N$-body runs. More precisely, a Fisher analysis reveals that both methods yield marginalized two-dimensional constraints that vary by less than 6% in area, a result that holds under different survey specifications and that matches to within 15% the area obtained from an analytical covariance calculation. Extending this comparison with our 25 $w$CDM models, we probe the cosmology dependence of the lensing covariance directly from numerical simulations, reproducing remarkably well the Fisher results from the analytical models at most cosmologies. We demonstrate that varying the cosmology at which the covariance matrix is evaluated in the first place might have an order of magnitude greater impact on the parameter constraints than varying the choice of covariance estimation technique. We present a test case in which we generate fast predictions for both the lensing signal and its associated variance with a flexible Gaussian process regression emulator, achieving an accuracy of a few percent on the former and 10% on the latter.","Joachim Harnois-Deraps, Ben Giblin, Benjamin Joachimi","27 pages, 23 figures, simulations available upon request",1905.06454v1,No journal ref found,Benjamin Joachimi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06454v1,2019-05-15 22:05:43+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Cosmic Shear Covariance Matrix in $w$CDM: Cosmology Matters,2019-05-15 22:05:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06454v1
503,"In the last few years, prominent high-ionization nebular emission lines (i.e., OIII], CIII], CIV, HeII) have been observed in the deep UV spectra of z~5-7 galaxies, indicating that extreme radiation fields characterize reionization-era systems. These lines have been linked to the leakage of Lyman continuum photons both theoretically and observationally. Consequently, high-ionization UV emission lines present our best probe to detect and characterize the most distant galaxies that we will observe in the coming years, and are key to understanding the sources of reionization, yet the physics governing their production is poorly understood. Here we present recent high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope spectra of two nearby extreme UV emission-line galaxies, J104457 and J141851. We report the first observations of intense nebular HeII and double-peaked, resonantly-scattered CIV emission, a combination that suggests these galaxies both produce and transmit a significant number of very high-energy ionizing photons (E>47.89 eV) through relatively low column densities of high-ionization gas. This suggests that, in addition to photons at the H-ionizing edge, the very hard ionizing photons that escape from these galaxies may provide a secondary source of ionization that is currently unconstrained observationally. Simultaneous radiative transfer models of LyA and CIV are needed to understand how ionizing radiation is transmitted through both low- and high-ionization gas. Future rest-frame FUV observations of galaxies within the epoch of reionization using the JWST or ELTs will allow us to constrain the escape of helium-ionizing photons and provide an estimate for their contribution to the reionization budget.","Danielle A.

504,"M82 X-2 is the first pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX)to be identified. Since the discovery in 2014, NuSTAR has observed the M82 field 15 times throughout 2015 and 2016. In this paper, we report the results of pulsation searches in all these datasets, and find only one new detection. This new detection allows us to refine the orbital period of the source and measure an average spin down rate between 2014 and 2016 of 5x10^-11 Hz/s, which is in contrast to the strong spin up seen during the 2014 observations and represent the first detection of spin down in a PULX system. Thanks to the improved orbital solution allowed by this new detection, we are also able to detect pulsations in additional segments of the original 2014 dataset. We find a glitch superimposed on the very strong and variable spin-up already reported, the first positive glitch identified in a PULX system. We discuss the new findings in the context of current leading models for PULXs.","Matteo Bachetti, Thomas J. Maccarone, Murray Brightman, McKinley C. Brumback, Felix FÃ¼rst, Fiona A.

505,"Observational SETI has concentrated on using electromagnetism as the carrier , namely radio waves and laser radiation. Michael Hippke [2] has pointed out that it may be possible to use neutrinos or gravitational waves as signals. Gravitational waves demand the command of the generation of very large scale amounts of energy, Jackson and Benford [3]. This paper describes a beacon that uses beamed neutrinos as the signal. Neutrinos, like gravitational waves, have the advantage of extremely low extinction in the interstellar medium. To make use of neutrinos an advanced civilization can use a gravitational lens as a focus and amplifier. The lens can be a neutron star or a black hole. Using wave optics one can calculate the advantage of gravitational lensing for amplification of a beam and along the optical axis it is exceptionally large. Even though the amplification is very large the dimeter of the beam is quite small, less that a centimeter. This implies that a large constellation of neutrino transmitters would have to enclose the local neutron star or black hole to cover the sky. This means that such a beacon would have to be built by a Kardashev Type II civilization.",A. A. Jackson,"13 pages , six figures",1905.05184v2,No journal ref found,A. A.

506,"We present predictions for the UV-to-mm extragalactic background light (EBL) from a recent version of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation which invokes a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) for galaxies undergoing dynamically-triggered bursts of star formation. We combine GALFORM with the GRASIL radiative transfer code for computing fully self-consistent UV-to-mm spectral energy distributions for each simulated galaxy, accounting for the absorption and re-emission of stellar radiation by interstellar dust. The predicted EBL is in near-perfect agreement with recent observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum, as is the evolution of the cosmic spectral energy distribution over the redshift range for which observations are available ($z\lesssim1$). We show that approximately 90~per~cent of the EBL is produced at $z<2$ although this shifts to higher redshifts for sub-mm wavelengths. We assess whether the top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary in order to reproduce the EBL at the same time as other key observables, and find that variant models with a universal solar-neighborhood IMF display poorer agreement with EBL observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum and fail to match the counts of galaxies in the sub-mm.","William.

Our aim is to begin to identify UDGs in the environments of nearby bright early-type galaxies from the VEGAS survey. Here we use a deep g band image of the NGC 5846 group, taken as part of the VEGAS survey, to search for UDGs. We found one object with properties of a UDG if it associated with the NGC 5846 group, which seems likely. The galaxy, we name NGC 5846$\_$UDG1, has an absolute magnitude of M$_g$ = -14.2, corresponding to a stellar mass of $\sim$10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$. It also reveals a system of compact sources which are likely globular clusters.

509,"In the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation, a galaxy overdensity is a hallmark of a massive cosmic structure. However, it is less well understood how different types of galaxies trace the underlying large-scale structure. Motivated by the discovery of a z=3.13 protocluster, we examine how the same structure is populated by Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs). To this end, we have undertaken a deep narrow-band imaging survey sampling Ly$\alpha$ emission at this redshift. Of the 93 LAE candidates within a 36'x36'~(70x70~Mpc^2) field, 21 galaxies form a significant surface overdensity (delta_g=3.3+/-0.9), which is spatially segregated from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) overdensity. One possible interpretation is that they trace two separate structures of comparable masses (~ 10^{15}M_sun) where the latter is hosted by a halo assembled at an earlier time. We speculate that the dearth of LAEs in the LBG overdensity region may signal the role of halo assembly bias in galaxy formation, which would suggest that different search techniques may be biased accordingly to the formation age or dynamical state of the host halo. The median Ly$\alpha$- and UV luminosity is 30--70\% higher for the protocluster LAEs relative to the field. This difference cannot be explained by the galaxy overdensity alone, and may require a top-heavy mass function, higher star formation efficiency for protocluster halos, or suppression of galaxy formation in low-mass halos. A luminous Ly$\alpha$ blob and an ultramassive galaxy found in this region paint a picture consistent with the expected early growth of galaxies in clusters.","Ke Shi, Yun Huang, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Jun Toshikawa, Kathryn N.

510,"This is the fourth of a series of papers on low X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. The sample comprises 45 galaxy clusters with X-ray luminosities fainter than 0.7 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at redshifts lower than 0.2 in the regions of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The sample of spectroscopic members of the galaxy clusters was obtained with the criteria: r$_p$ $\le$ 1 Mpc and $\Delta V \leq \sigma$ using our $\sigma$ estimates containing 21 galaxy clusters with more than 6 spectroscopic members. We have also defined a sample of photometric members with galaxies that satisfy r$_p \le $ 1 Mpc, and $\Delta V \leq $ 6000 \kms including 45 galaxy clusters with more than 6 cluster members.   We have divided the redshift range in three bins: $z \leq 0.065$; 0.065 $<$ z $<$ 0.10; and z $\ge$ 0.10. We have stacked the galaxy clusters using the spectroscopic sub-sample and we have computed the best RS linear fit within 1$\sigma$ dispersion. With the photometric sub-sample, we have added more data to the RS obtaining the photometric 1$\sigma$ dispersion relative to the spectroscopic RS fit. We have computed the luminosity function using the $1/V_{max}$ method fitting it with a Schechter function. The obtained parameters for these galaxy clusters with low X-ray luminosities are remarkably similar to those for groups and poor galaxy clusters at these lower redshifts.","A. L. O'Mill, M. V.

511,"Quiescence in galaxies correlates strongly with the central density/morphology of the stellar distribution. We investigate two possible explanations for this morphology-quiescence relation: 1) the central density results from a dissipative core-building event (""compaction"") that feeds an AGN that quenches the galaxy and 2) the central density results from inside-out growth by galaxy-wide star formation that is quenched by processes unrelated to the central density. We aim to distinguish these two scenarios using the MaNGA survey to determine profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas phase metallicity (O/H) as a function of stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc (Sigma_1kpc) and total stellar mass (M*). We find that gradients in age, sSFR and O/H depend on the galaxy's position on the Sigma_1kpc-M* diagram, suggesting at least two evolutionary pathways. The first pathway consists of galaxies with low Sigma_1kpc for their M* whose centres are old, metal-rich and suppressed in sSFR compared to their outskirts, consistent with the inside-out growth scenario. The second pathway, consistent with a compaction-like core-building scenario, consists of galaxies with higher Sigma_1kpc for their M*, whose centres are younger, enhanced in sSFR and metal-deficient compared to their outskirts. Moreover, the WISE-selected AGN fraction peaks in the same area of the Sigma_1kpc-M* diagram as the core-building pathway. The sSFR profiles of the quiescent population suggest that galaxies on the compaction-like path quench uniformly, while those on the inside-out growing path quench their centres first. Our results imply that both pathways contribute to the morphology-quiescence relation.","Joanna Woo, Sara L.

512,"Transition discs are prime targets to look for protoplanets and study planet-disc interactions. We present VLT/SINFONI observations of PDS~70, a transition disc with a recently claimed embedded protoplanet. We take advantage of the angular and spectral diversity present in our data for an optimal PSF modeling and subtraction using principal component analysis (PCA). We report the redetection of PDS 70 b, both the front and far side of the outer disc edge, and the detection of several extended features in the annular gap. We compare spectral differential imaging applied before (PCA-SADI), and after (PCA-ASDI) angular differential imaging. Our tests suggest that PCA-SADI better recovers extended features, while PCA-ASDI is more sensitive to point sources.

513,"We present the first observational evidence for a circumplanetary disc around the protoplanet PDS~70~b, based on a new spectrum in the $K$ band acquired with VLT/SINFONI. We tested three hypotheses to explain the spectrum: Atmospheric emission from the planet with either (1) a single value of extinction or (2) variable extinction, and (3) a combined atmospheric and circumplanetary disc model. Goodness-of-fit indicators favour the third option, suggesting circumplanetary material contributing excess thermal emission --- most prominent at $\lambda \gtrsim 2.3 \mu$m. Inferred accretion rates ($\sim 10^{-7.8}$--$10^{-7.3} M_J$ yr$^{-1}$) are compatible with observational constraints based on the H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ lines. For the planet, we derive an effective temperature of 1500--1600 K, surface gravity $\log(g)\sim 4.0$, radius $\sim 1.6 R_J$, mass $\sim 10 M_J$, and possible thick clouds. Models with variable extinction lead to slightly worse fits. However, the amplitude ($\Delta A_V \gtrsim 3$mag) and timescale of variation ($\lesssim$~years) required for the extinction would also suggest circumplanetary material.","V. Christiaens, F.

514,"We describe a software package called VPLanet that simulates fundamental aspects of planetary system evolution over Gyr timescales, with a focus on investigating habitable worlds. In this first version, eleven physics modules are included that model internal, atmospheric, rotational, orbital, stellar, and galactic processes. Many of these modules can be coupled to simultaneously simulate the evolution of terrestrial planets, gaseous planets, and stars. The code is validated by reproducing a selection of observations and past results. VPLanet is written in C and designed so that the user can choose the physics modules to apply to an individual object at runtime without recompiling, i.e., a single executable can simulate the diverse phenomena that are relevant to a wide range of planetary and stellar systems. This feature is enabled by matrices and vectors of function pointers that are dynamically allocated and populated based on user input. The speed and modularity of VPLanet enables large parameter sweeps and the versatility to add/remove physical phenomena to asses their importance.

By correcting for the lensing distortion using a grid-based lens modelling technique, we spatially locate the different emitting regions in the source plane for the first time. Both AGN host galaxies have 300 to 500 pc-scale size and surface brightness consistent with a bulge/pseudo-bulge, and 2 kpc-scale AGN radio jets that are embedded in extended molecular gas reservoirs that are 5 to 20 kpc in size. The CO (1$-$0) velocity fields show structures possibly associated with discs (elongated velocity gradients) and interacting objects (off-axis velocity components). There is evidence for a decrement in the CO (1$-$0) surface brightness at the location of the host galaxy, which may indicate radiative feedback from the AGN, or offset star formation.We find CO-H$_2$ conversion factors of around $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 1.5\pm0.5$ (K km\,s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$, molecular gas masses of $> 3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, dynamical masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ and gas fractions of around 60 per cent. The intrinsic CO line luminosities are comparable to those of unobscured AGN and dusty star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts, but the infrared luminosities are lower, suggesting that the targets are less efficient at forming stars.

516,"We analyze the statistics of pulse arrival times in FRB 121102 and demonstrate that they are remarkably similar to statistics of magnetar high-energy short bursts. Motivated by this correspondence, we propose that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal slippage events dislocate field line footpoints, initiating intense particle acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted if the efficiency of conversion of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\sim 1$ GHz radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio pulse duration to $\sim1$ ms. Within the framework of our model, the current dataset of polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic obliquity $\alpha\lesssim40^\circ$ and viewing angle $\zeta$ with respect to the spin axis $\alpha<\zeta<180^\circ-\alpha$.","Zorawar Wadiasingh, Andrey Timokhin","11 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ApJ, comments welcome",1904.12036v2,No journal ref found,Andrey Timokhin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12036v2,2019-04-26 20:29:13+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Repeating Fast Radio Bursts from Magnetars with Low Magnetospheric Twist,2019-05-15 18:07:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12036v2

We have combined these radio images with their counterparts in the TIFR GMRT sky survey (TGSS) at 150 MHz (TGSS alternative data release, TGSS_ADR1), in an attempt to identify any low surface-brightness radio emission present in these sources. This has enabled us to assemble a sample of 106 `strong' XRG candidates and 184 `probable' XRG candidates whose XRG designation must be verified by further observations. The present sample of 290 XRG candidates is almost twice as large as the number of XRGs presently known. Twenty-five of our 290 XRG candidates (9 `strong' and 16 `probable') are identified as quasars. Double-peaked narrow emission lines are seen in the optical spectra of three of the XRG candidates (2 `strong' and 1 `probable'). Nearly 90% of the sample is located in the FR II domain of the Owen-Ledlow diagram. A few of the strong XRG candidates have a rather flat radio spectrum (spectral index $\alpha$ flatter than -0.3) between 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz, or between 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Since this is not expected for lobe-dominated extragalactic radio sources (like nearly all known XRGs), these sources are particularly suited for follow-up radio imaging and near-simultaneous measurement of the radio spectrum.","Xiaolong Yang, Ravi Joshi, Gopal-Krishna, Tao An, Luis C.

519,"The evolution of planets, stars and even galaxies is driven, to a large extent, by dynamical friction of gravitational origin. There is now a good understanding of the friction produced by extended media, either collisionless of fluid-like. However, the physics of accretion or protoplanetary disks, for instance, is described by slab-like geometries instead, compact in one spatial direction. Here, we find, for the first time, the gravitational wake due to a massive perturber moving through a slab-like medium, describing e.g. accretion disks with sharp transitions. We show that dynamical friction in such environments can be substantially reduced relatively to spatially extended profiles. Finally, we provide simple and accurate expressions for the gravitational drag force felt by the perturber, in both the subsonic and supersonic regime.","Rodrigo Vicente, Vitor Cardoso, Miguel ZilhÃ£o","10 pages, 8 figures",1905.06353v1,No journal ref found,Miguel ZilhÃ£o,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06353v1,2019-05-15 18:00:29+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|gr-qc,Dynamical friction in slab geometries and accretion disks,2019-05-15 18:00:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06353v1
520,"Planetary nebulae (PNe) provide tests of stellar evolution, can serve as tracers of chemical evolution in the Milky Way and other galaxies, and are also used as a calibrator of the cosmological distance ladder. Current and upcoming large scale photometric surveys have the potential to complete the census of PNe in our galaxy and beyond, but it is a challenge to disambiguate partially or fully unresolved PNe from the myriad other sources observed in these surveys. Here we carry out synthetic observations of nebular models to determine $ugrizy$ color-color spaces that can successfully identify PNe among billions of other sources. As a primary result we present a grid of synthetic absolute magnitudes for PNe at various stages of their evolution, and we make comparisons with real PNe colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the $r-i$ versus $g-r$, and the $r-i$ versus $u-g$, color-color diagrams show the greatest promise for cleanly separating PNe from stars, background galaxies, and quasars. Finally, we consider the potential harvest of PNe from upcoming large surveys. For example, for typical progenitor host star masses of $\sim$3 M$_\odot$, we find that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should be sensitive to virtually all PNe in the Magellanic Clouds with extinction up to $A_{\rm V}$ of $\sim$5 mag; out to the distance of Andromeda, LSST would be sensitive to the youngest PNe (age less than $\sim$6800 yr) and with $A_{\rm V}$ up to 1 mag.","George Vejar, Rodolfo Montez Jr., Margaret Morris, Keivan G.

521,"We consider direct-detection searches for sub-GeV dark matter via electron scatterings in the presence of large interactions between dark and ordinary matter. Scatterings both on electrons and nuclei in the Earth's crust, atmosphere, and shielding material attenuate the expected local dark matter flux at a terrestrial detector, so that such experiments lose sensitivity to dark matter above some critical cross section. We study various models, including dark matter interacting with a heavy and ultralight dark photon, through an electric dipole moment, and exclusively with electrons. For a dark-photon mediator and an electric dipole interaction, the dark matter-electron scattering cross-section is directly linked to the dark matter-nucleus cross section, and nuclear interactions typically dominate the attenuation process. We determine the exclusion bands for the different dark-matter models from several experiments - SENSEI, CDMS-HVeV, XENON10, XENON100, and DarkSide-50 - using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and analytic estimates. We also derive projected sensitivities for a detector located at different depths and for a range of exposures, and calculate the projected sensitivity for SENSEI at SNOLAB and DAMIC-M at Modane. Finally, we discuss the reach to high cross sections and the modulation signature of a small balloon- and satellite-borne detector sensitive to electron recoils, such as a Skipper-CCD. Such a detector could potentially probe unconstrained parameter space at high cross sections for a sub-dominant component of dark matter interacting with a massive, but ultralight, dark photon.","Timon Emken, Rouven Essig, Chris Kouvaris, Mukul Sholapurkar","39 pages, 12 figures.

522,"We study mass ejection from accretion disks formed in the merger of a white dwarf with a neutron star or black hole. These disks are mostly radiatively-inefficient and support nuclear fusion reactions, with ensuing outflows and electromagnetic transients. Here we perform time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of these disks including a physical equation of state, viscous angular momentum transport, a coupled $19$-isotope nuclear network, and self-gravity. We find no detonations in any of the configurations studied. Our global models extend from the central object to radii much larger than the disk. We evolve these global models for several orbits, as well as alternate versions with an excised inner boundary to much longer times. We obtain robust outflows, with a broad velocity distribution in the range $10^2-10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. The outflow composition is mostly that of the initial white dwarf, with burning products mixed in at the $\lesssim 10-30\%$ level by mass, including up to $\sim 10^{-2}M_\odot$ of ${}^{56}$Ni. These heavier elements (plus ${}^{4}$He) are ejected within $\lesssim 40^\circ$ of the rotation axis, and should have higher average velocities than the lighter elements that make up the white dwarf. These results are in broad agreement with previous one- and two-dimensional studies, and point to these systems as progenitors of rapidly-rising ($\sim $ few day) transients. If accretion onto the central BH/NS powers a relativistic jet, these events could be accompanied by high energy transients with peak luminosities $\sim 10^{47}-10^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and peak durations of up to several minutes, possibly accounting for events like CDF-S XT2.","Rodrigo FernÃ¡ndez, Ben Margalit, Brian D.

523,"This study is motivated by recent observations on ubiquitous interstellar density filaments and guided by modern theories of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The interstellar turbulence shapes the observed density structures. As the fundamental dynamics of compressible MHD turbulence, perpendicular turbulent mixing of density fluctuations entails elongated density structures aligned with the local magnetic field, accounting for low-density parallel filaments seen in diffuse atomic and molecular gas. The elongation of low-density parallel filaments depends on the turbulence anisotropy. When taking into account the partial ionization, we find that the minimum width of parallel filaments in the cold neutral medium and molecular clouds is determined by the neutral-ion decoupling scale perpendicular to magnetic field. In highly supersonic MHD turbulence in molecular clouds, both low-density parallel filaments due to anisotropic turbulent mixing and high-density filaments due to shock compression exist.","Siyao Xu, Suoqing Ji, A.

524,"Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates, especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of detection map by analyzing the speckle noise distribution, namely the Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption. From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to determine detection threshold providing a good trade off between true positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.","BenoÃ®t Pairet, Faustine Cantalloube, Carlos A.

525,"We study the stochastic formalism of inflation beyond the usual slow-roll approximation. We verify that the assumptions on which the stochastic formalism relies still hold even far from the slow-roll attractor. This includes demonstrating the validity of the separate universe approach to evolving long-wavelength scalar field perturbations beyond slow roll. We also explain that, in general, there is a gauge correction to the amplitude of the stochastic noise. This is because the amplitude is usually calculated in the spatially-flat gauge, while the number of e-folds is used as the time variable (hence one works in the uniform-$N$ gauge) in the Langevin equations. We show that these corrections vanish in the slow-roll limit, but we also explain how to calculate them in general. We compute them in difference cases, including ultra-slow roll and the Starobinsky model that interpolates between slow roll and ultra-slow roll, and find the corrections to be negligible in practice. This confirms the validity of the stochastic formalism for studying quantum backreaction effects in the very early universe beyond slow roll.","Chris Pattison, Vincent Vennin, Hooshyar Assadullahi, David Wands","20 pages without appendices (total 28 pages), 1 figure",1905.06300v1,No journal ref found,David Wands,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06300v1,2019-05-15 17:18:50+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-th,Stochastic inflation beyond slow roll,2019-05-15 17:18:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06300v1

UFKWs are eastward propagating, have a 2-3 sol period with sufficiently long vertical wavelengths to propagate into the thermosphere, and are predicted by classical wave theory to be equatorially trapped. These prior measurements characterized UFKWs at two relatively narrow altitude bands, with one measurement altitude near 80 km and a second near 150 km. Thermospheric density profiles from solar occultation (SO) measurements made by the Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor (EUVM) onboard MAVEN [2] provide a means to characterize multi-sol period waves, including UFKWs, as a function of altitude. In this study, we present first-ever observations of UFKWs as a function of altitude, including observations of rapid wave energy dissipation near 170 km indicative of wave breaking.","Edward M. B.

It resolves the neutron lifetime discrepancy, i.e., the 1\% difference in neutron lifetime between measurements from ""beam"" and ""bottle"" experiments. In consideration of the early universe evolution, the $n-n'$ mass difference is determined to be about $2\times 10^{-6}$ eV/c$^2$ with the $n-n'$ mixing strength of about $2\times 10^{-5}$. The picture of how the mirror-to-ordinary matter density ratio is evolved in the early universe into the observed dark-to-baryon matter density ratio of about 5.4 is presented.

528,"We present the observation and analysis of newly discovered coherent structures in the L1688 region of Ophiuchus and the B18 region of Taurus. Using data from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS), we identify regions of high density and near-constant, almost-thermal, velocity dispersion. Eighteen coherent structures are revealed, twelve in L1688 and six in B18, each of which shows a sharp ""transition to coherence"" in velocity dispersion around its periphery. The identification of these structures provides a chance to study the coherent structures in molecular clouds statistically. The identified coherent structures have a typical radius of 0.04 pc and a typical mass of 0.4 Msun, generally smaller than previously known coherent cores identified by Goodman et al. (1998), Caselli et al. (2002), and Pineda et al. (2010). We call these structures ""droplets."" We find that unlike previously known coherent cores, these structures are not virially bound by self-gravity and are instead predominantly confined by ambient pressure. The droplets have density profiles shallower than a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and they have a velocity (VLSR) distribution consistent with the dense gas motions traced by NH3 emission. These results point to a potential formation mechanism through pressure compression and turbulent processes in the dense gas. We present a comparison with a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a star-forming region, and we speculate on the relationship of droplets with larger, gravitationally bound coherent cores, as well as on the role that droplets and other coherent structures play in the star formation process.","Hope How-Huan Chen, Jaime E.

529,"Based on new near-infrared spectroscopic data from the instrument EMIR on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) we report the presence of an ionized and warm molecular outflow in the luminous type-2 quasar J150904.22+043441.8 (z = 0.1118). The ionized outflow is faster than its molecular counterpart, although the outflow sizes that we derive for them are consistent within the errors (1.34$\pm$0.18 kpc and 1.46$\pm$0.20 kpc respectively). We use these radii, the broad emission-line luminosities and in the case of the ionized outflow, the density calculated from the trans-auroral [OII] and [SII] lines, to derive mass outflow rates and kinetic coupling efficiencies. Whilst the ionized and warm molecular outflows represent a small fraction of the AGN power ($\leq$0.033% and 0.0001% of L$_{bol}$ respectively), the total molecular outflow, whose mass is estimated from an assumed warm-to-cold gas mass ratio of 6$\times10^{-5}$, has a kinetic coupling efficiency of $\sim$1.7%L$_{bol}$. Despite the large uncertainty, this molecular outflow represents a significant fraction of L$_{bol}$ and it could potentially have a significant impact on the host galaxy. In addition, the quasar spectrum reveals bright and patchy narrow Pa$\alpha$ emission extending out to 4 arcsec (8 kpc) South-East and North-West from the active nucleus.","Cristina Ramos Almeida, Jose A.

530,"On the base of the simplest model of a modulation of 3D Gaussian field in $k$-space we produce a set of simulations to bring out the effects of a modulating function $f_{\rm mod} (k)=f_1 (k) + f_2 (k)$ on power spectra of radial (shell-like) distributions of cosmological objects, where a model function $f_1 (k)$ reproduces the smoothed power spectrum of underlying 3D density fluctuations, while $f_2 (k)$ is a wiggling function imitating the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). It is shown that some excess of realizations of simulated radial distributions actually displays quasi-periodical components with periods about a characteristic scale $2\pi/k \sim 100~h^{-1}$~Mpc detected as power-spectrum peaks in vicinity of the first maximum of the modulation function $f_2 (k)$. We revised our previous estimations of the significance of such peaks and found that they were largely overestimated. Thereby quasi-periodical components appearing in some radial distributions of matter are likely to be stochastic (rather than determinative), while the amplitudes of the respective spectral peaks can be quite noticeable. They are partly enhanced by smooth part of the modulating function $f_1(k)$ and, to a far lesser extent, by effects of the BAO (i.e. $f_2(k)$). The results of the simulations match quite well with statistical properties of the radial distributions of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).","Andrei Ryabinkov, Aleksandr Kaminker","13 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astrophysics and

531,"We present optical IFU observations of the Taffy system (UGC 12914/15); named for the radio emission that stretches between the two galaxies. Given that these gas rich galaxies are believed to have recently collided head-on, the pair exhibits a surprisingly normal total (sub-LIRG) IR luminosity ($\mathrm{L_{FIR} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{10}}$ L$_\odot$). Previous observations have demonstrated that a large quantity of molecular and neutral gas have been drawn out of the galaxies into a massive multi-phase bridge. We present, for the first time, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the ionized gas in the system. The results show that the ionized gas is highly disturbed kinematically, with gas spread in two main filaments between the two galaxies. The line profiles exhibit widespread double components in both the bridge and parts of the disks of the galaxies. We investigate the spatial distribution of the excitation properties of the ionized gas using emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and conclude that large quantities (up to 40$\%$) of the emission from the entire system is consistent with gas heated in $\sim$200 \kms\ shocks. While the shocked gas is mainly associated with the bridge, there is a significant amount of shocked gas associated with both galaxies. Confirming other multi-wavelength indicators, the results suggest that the effects of shocks and turbulence can continue to be felt in a high-speed galaxy collision long after the collision has occurred. The persistence of shocks in the Taffy system may explain the relatively low current star formation rates in the system as a whole.","Bhavin A. Joshi, Philip N. Appleton, Guillermo A.

The mechanisms responsible for disk polarization at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are currently under debate. In this Letter, we investigate two mechanisms capable of producing polarized dust emission in disks: self-scattering and grain alignment to the radiation anisotropy. The polarization morphologies of DG Tau and Haro 6-13 are broadly consistent with that expected from radiation alignment (though radiative alignment still does not account for all of the features seen in these disks), while RY Tau and MWC 480 are more consistent with self-scattering.

533,"One of the most pressing questions in modified gravity is how deviations from general relativity can manifest in upcoming galaxy surveys. This is especially relevant for theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening, where such deviations are efficiently suppressed within a (typically large) Vainshtein radius. However, Vainshtein screening is known to be shape dependent: it is most effective around spherical sources, weaker around cylindrical objects and completely absent for planar sources. The Cosmic Web therefore offers a testing ground, as it displays many shapes in the form of clusters, filaments and walls.   In this work, we explicitly derive the signature of the shape dependence of Vainshtein screening on the matter bispectrum, by considering a cubic Galileon model with a conformal coupling to matter and a cosmological constant. We perform a second order perturbative analysis, deriving analytic, integral expressions for the bispectrum, which we integrate using \texttt{hi\_class}. We find that the shape dependence of Vainshtein screening enters the bispectrum with a unique scale-factor dependence of $\propto a^{3/2}$.

535,"We analyze 10 years of Fermi-LAT data towards the SS433/W50 region. With the latest source catalog and diffuse background models, the gamma-ray excess from SS433/W50 is detected with a significance of 6{\sigma} in the photon energy range of 500 MeV - 10 GeV. Our analysis indicates that an extended flat disk morphology is preferred over a point-source description, suggesting that the GeV emission region is much larger than that of the TeV emission detected by HAWC. The size of the GeV emission is instead consistent with the extent of the radio nebula W50, a supernova remnant being distorted by the jets, so we suggest that the GeV emission may originate from this supernova remnant. The spectral result of the GeV emission is also consistent with an supernova remnant origin. We also derive the GeV flux upper limits on the TeV emission region, which put moderate constrains on the leptonic models to explain the multiwavelength data.","Xiao-Na Sun, Rui-Zhi Yang, Bing Liu, Shao-Qiang Xi, Xiang-Yu Wang","7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",1904.05127v2,No journal ref found,Xiang-Yu Wang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05127v2,2019-04-10 12:09:21+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|hep-ph,Tentative evidence of spatially extended GeV emission from SS433/W50,2019-05-15 15:52:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05127v2

Their characteristics are sensitive both to the mass of the primary cosmic ray and to the details of hadronic interactions. Many of the interactions that determine the shower features occur in kinematic regions and at energies beyond those tested by human-made accelerators. We will report on the measurement of the proton-air cross section for particle production at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon of 39 TeV and 56 TeV. We will also show comparisons of post-LHC hadronic interaction models with shower data by studying the moments of the distribution of the depth of the electromagnetic maximum, the number and production depth of muons in air showers, and finally a parameter based on the rise-time of the surface detector signal, sensitive to the electromagnetic and muonic component of the shower.

537,"Aims: Highly resolved maps of the local Galactic dust are an important ingredient for sky emission models. In nearly the whole electromagnetic spectrum one can see imprints of dust, many of which originate from dust clouds within 300pc. Having a detailed 3D reconstruction of these local dust clouds enables detailed studies, helps to quantify the impact on other observables and is a milestone necessary to enable larger reconstructions, as every sightline for more distant objects will pass through the local dust.   Methods: To infer the dust density we use parallax and absorption estimates published by the Gaia collaboration in their second data release. We model the dust as a log-normal process using a hierarchical Bayesian model. We also infer non-parametrically the kernel of the log-normal process, which corresponds to the physical spatial correlation power spectrum of the log-density.   Results: Using only Gaia data of the second Gaia data release, we reconstruct the 3D dust density and its spatial correlation spectrum in a 600pc cube centered on the Sun. We report a spectral index of the logarithmic dust density of $3.1$ on Fourier scales with wavelengths between 2pc and 125pc.

Though the same detection technique is used at both installations, the straightforward comparison of the characteristics of the measured $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions is not possible due to the different approaches to the analysis of the recorded events. In this work, the Auger-Telescope Array composition working group presents a technique to compare the $X_\mathrm{max}$ measurements from the Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array. Applying this technique the compatibility of the first two moments of the measured $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions is qualitatively tested for energies $10^{18.2}~{\rm eV} < E < 10^{19.0}~{\rm eV}$ using the recently published Telescope Array data from the Black Rock Mesa and Long Ridge fluorescence detector stations.

539,"We examine the thermal evolution of particle number densities in the early universe when the particles have a finite diffusion length. Assuming that annihilations are impossible when the mean separation of the particles is larger than their diffusion length, we derive a version of the Boltzmann equation for freeze out in this scenario and an approximate solution, accurate to better than 2\%. The effect of a finite diffusion length is to increase the final relic freeze-out abundance over its corresponding value when diffusion effects are ignored. When diffusion is limited only by scattering off of the thermal background, and the annihilation cross section is bounded by unitarity, a significant effect on the freeze-out abundance requires a scattering cross section much larger than the annihilation cross section. A similar effect is demonstrated when the relic particles are produced via the freeze-in mechanism, but in this case the finite diffusion length is due to the scattering of particles that annihilate into the relic particle of interest. For freeze in, the effect of a finite diffusion length is to reduce the final relic particle abundance. The effects of a finite diffusion length are most important when the scattering cross section or the relic mass are very large. While we have not found a particularly compelling example where this would affect previous results, with the current interest in new dark matter candidates it could become an important consideration.","Robert J.

This instability is usually circumvented using certain gauge choices. We show that the perturbations can be evolved across this point by solving the first order differential equations governing suitable gauge invariant quantities without any instabilities.

541,"Kepler-62f is the first exoplanet small enough to plausibly have a rocky composition orbiting within the habitable zone (HZ) discovered by the Kepler Mission. The planet is 1.4 times the size of the Earth and has an orbital period of 267 days. At the time of its discovery, it had the longest period of any small planet in the habitable zone of a multi-planet system. Because of its long period, only four transits were observed during Kepler's interval of observations. It was initially missed by the Kepler pipeline, but the first three transits were identified by an independent search by Eric Agol, and it was identified as a planet candidate in subsequent Kepler catalogs. However in the latest catalog of exoplanets (Thompson et al., 2018), it is labeled as a false positive. Recent exoplanet catalogues have evolved from subjective classification to automatic classifications of planet candidates by algorithms (such as `Robovetter'). While exceptionally useful for producing a uniform catalogue, these algorithms sometimes misclassify planet candidates as a false positive, as is the case of Kepler-62f. In particularly valuable cases, i.e., when a small planet has been found orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ), it is important to conduct comprehensive analyses of the data and classification protocols to provide the best estimate of the true status of the detection. In this paper we conduct such analyses and show that Kepler-62f is a true planet and not a false positive.

While it is clearly a rapid rotator, recent determinations of $P_{\rm rot}$ are in formal disagreement. In this paper we collect magnetic and photometric data with a combined 40-year baseline in order to re-evaluate $P_{\rm rot}$ and examine its stability. Both period analysis of individual datasets and $O-C$ analysis of the photometric data demonstrate that $P_{\rm rot}$ has decreased over the past 30 years, violating expectations from magnetospheric braking models, but consistent with behaviour reported for 2 other hot, rapidly rotating magnetic stars, CU Vir and HD 37776. The available magnetic and photometric time series for HD 142990 can be coherently phased assuming a spin-up rate $\dot{P}$ of approximately $-0.6$ s/yr, although there is some indication that $\dot{P}$ may have slowed in recent years, possibly indicating an irregular or cyclic rotational evolution.","M.

We introduce the first study on the dynamical properties of anisotropic self-gravitating fluids in a covariant framework. Our description is particularly useful in the context of tests of the black hole paradigm, wherein ultracompact objects are used as black hole mimickers but otherwise lack a proper theoretical framework. We show that: (i) anisotropic stars can be as compact and as massive as black holes, even for very small anisotropy parameters; (ii) the nonlinear dynamics of the 1+1 system is in good agreement with linearized calculations, and shows that configurations below the maximum mass are nonlinearly stable; (iii) strongly anisotropic stars have vanishing tidal Love numbers in the black-hole limit; (iv) their formation will usually be accompanied by gravitational-wave echoes at late times.","Guilherme Raposo, Paolo Pani, Miguel Bezares, Carlos Palenzuela, Vitor Cardoso","7+2 pages, 6 figures; v2: include extra material (general covariant

544,"Context. Stellar magnetic fields are one of the candidates often invoked to explain the missing transport of angular momentum observed in the models of stellar interiors. However, the properties of an internal magnetic field and the consequences of its presence on stellar evolution are largely unknown.   Aims. We study the effect of an axisymmetric internal magnetic field on the frequency of gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars to check whether gravity modes can be used to detect and probe such a field.   Methods. Rotation is taken into account using the traditional approximation of rotation and the effect of the magnetic field is computed using a perturbative approach. As a proof of concept, we compute frequency shifts due to a mixed (i.e. with both poloidal and toroidal components) fossil magnetic field for a representative model of a known magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly pulsating B-type star, namely HD 43317.   Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field scale with the square of its amplitude. A magnetic field with a near-core strength of order 150 kG (which is consistent with the observed surface field strength of order 1 kG) leads to signatures that are detectable in period spacings for high-radial-order gravity modes.   Conclusions. The predicted frequency shifts can be used to constrain internal magnetic fields and offers the potential for a significant step forward in our interpretation of the observed structure of gravity-mode period spacing patterns in rapidly rotating stars.","V.

545,"If the inflaton and the quintessence fields are identified, the background geometry evolves through a stiff epoch undershooting the expansion rate of a radiation-dominated plasma. For some classes of inflationary potentials this scenario is at odds with the current observational evidence since the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio is too large. Quintessential inflation is analyzed when the gravitational action is supplemented by a contribution quadratic in the Einstein-Hilbert term. In the Palatini formulation the addition such a term does not affect the scalar modes during the inflationary phase and throughout the course of the subsequent stiff epoch but it suppresses the tensor power spectrum and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While in the Palatini formulation the power-law potentials leading to a quintessential inflationary dynamics are again viable, the high-frequency spike of the relic graviton spectrum is squeezed and the whole signal is suppressed at least when the higher-order contributions appearing in the action are explicitly decoupled from the inflaton.",Massimo Giovannini,25 pages,1905.06182v1,No journal ref found,Massimo Giovannini,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06182v1,2019-05-15 13:44:06+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|hep-ph|hep-th,Post-inflationary phases stiffer than radiation and Palatini formulation,2019-05-15 13:44:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06182v1
546,"Galaxy clusters observed through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect are a recent cosmological probe. The precision on the cosmological constraints is affected mainly by the current knowledge of cluster physics, which enters the analysis through the scaling relations. Here we aim to study one of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties, the mass bias, $b$. We have analysed the effects of a mass-redshift dependence, adopting a power-law parametrisation. We applied this parametrisation to the combination of tSZ number counts and power spectrum, finding a hint of redshift dependence that leads to a decreasing value of the mass bias for higher redshift. We tested the robustness of our results for different mass bias calibrations and a discrete redshift dependence. We find our results to be dependent on the clusters sample that we are considering, in particular obtaining an inverse (decreasing) redshift dependence when neglecting $z<0.2$ clusters. We analysed the effects of this parametrisation on the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and tSZ galaxy clusters. We find a preferred constant value of mass bias, having $(1-b) =0.62 \pm 0.05$. The corresponding value of $b$ is too high with respect to weak lensing and numerical simulations estimations. Therefore we conclude that this mass-redshift parametrisation does not help in solving the remaining discrepancy between CMB and tSZ clusters observations.","Laura Salvati, Marian Douspis, Anna Ritz, Nabila Aghanim, Arif Babul","14 pages, 9 figures",1901.03096v2,No journal ref found,Arif Babul,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03096v2,2019-01-10 10:56:00+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Mass bias evolution in tSZ cluster cosmology,2019-05-15 13:34:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03096v2

548,"The Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) provided an unprecedented volume of precise astrometric and excellent photometric data. In terms of data mining the Gaia catalogue, machine learning methods have shown to be a powerful tool to, for instance, search for hitherto unknown stellar structures. Particularly, supervised and unsupervised learning methods combined together allow to significantly improve the detection of open clusters. We systematically scan Gaia DR2 in a region covering the Galactic anticentre and the Perseus arm (120<=l<=205 and -10<=b<=10), with the goal of populating this region with open clusters and fine tuning the methodology, proposed in arXiv:1805.03045v2 and successfully applied to TGAS data, adapting it to different density regions. Our methodology uses an unsupervised, density based, clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, that identifies over-densities in the five dimensional astrometric parameter space (l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_{\delta}) that may correspond to physical clusters. The over-densities are separated into physical clusters (open clusters) or random statistical clusters using an artificial neural network to recognise the isochrone pattern that open clusters show in a colour magnitude diagram. The method is able to recover more than 75% of the open clusters confirmed in the search area. Moreover, we are able to detect 58 open clusters unknown previous to Gaia DR2, which represent an increase of around 25% with respect to the already catalogued ones in this region. We find that the census of nearby open clusters is not complete. Different machine learning based methodologies for a blind search of open clusters are complementary to each other, with no single method being able to detect the 100% of the existing groups. Our methodology has shown to be a reliable tool for the automatic detection of open clusters, designed to be applied to the full Gaia DR2 catalogue.","A. Castro-Ginard, C. Jordi, X. Luri, T.

549,"We study the polarization properties of 22 known rotating radio transients (RRATs) with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope and present the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for the 17 with linearly polarized flux exceeding the off-pulse noise by 3$\sigma$. Each RM was estimated using a brute-force search over trial RMs that spanned the maximum measurable range $\pm1.18 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{rad \, m^2}$ (in steps of 1 $\mathrm{rad \, m^2}$), followed by an iterative refinement algorithm. The measured RRAT RMs are in the range |RM| $\sim 1$ to $\sim 950$ rad m$^{-2}$ with an average linear polarization fraction of $\sim 40$ per cent. Individual single pulses are observed to be up to 100 per cent linearly polarized. The RMs of the RRATs and the corresponding inferred average magnetic fields (parallel to the line-of-sight and weighted by the free electron density) are observed to be consistent with the Galactic plane pulsar population. Faraday rotation analyses are typically performed on accumulated pulsar data, for which hundreds to thousands of pulses have been integrated, rather than on individual pulses. Therefore, we verified the iterative refinement algorithm by performing Monte Carlo simulations of artificial single pulses over a wide range of S/N and RM. At and above a S/N of 17 in linearly polarized flux, the iterative refinement recovers the simulated RM value 100 per cent of the time with a typical mean uncertainty of $\sim5$ rad m$^{-2}$.

550,"(Abridged) The CASA software suite, can now reduce very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data with the recent addition of a fringe fitter. Here, we present the Radboud PIpeline for the Calibration of high Angular Resolution Data (rPICARD), which is an open-source VLBI calibration and imaging pipeline built on top of the CASA framework. The pipeline is capable of reducing data from different VLBI arrays. It can be run non-interactively after only a few non-default input parameters are set and delivers high-quality calibrated data. CPU scalability based on a message-passing interface (MPI) implementation ensures that large bandwidth data from future arrays can be processed within reasonable computing times. Phase calibration is done with a Schwab-Cotton fringe fit algorithm. For the calibration of residual atmospheric effects, optimal solution intervals are determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the data for each scan. Different solution intervals can be set for different antennas in the same scan to increase the number of detections in the low S/N regime. These novel techniques allow rPICARD to calibrate data from different arrays, including high-frequency and low-sensitivity arrays. The amplitude calibration is based on standard telescope metadata, and a robust algorithm can solve for atmospheric opacity attenuation in the high-frequency regime. Standard CASA tasks are used for CLEAN imaging and self-calibration. In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of rPICARD by calibrating and imaging 7 mm VLBA data of the central radio source in the M87 galaxy. The reconstructed jet image reveals a complex collimation profile and edge-brightened structure. A potential counter-jet is detected that has 10 % of the brightness of the approaching jet.

551,"Gravitational softening length is one of the key parameters to properly set up a cosmological $N$-body simulation. In this paper, we perform a large suit of high-resolution $N$-body simulations to revise the optimal softening scheme proposed by Power et al. (P03). Our finding is that P03 optimal scheme works well but is over conservative. Using smaller softening lengths than that of P03 can achieve higher spatial resolution and numerically convergent results on both circular velocity and density profiles. However using an over small softening length overpredicts matter density at the inner most region of dark matter haloes. We empirically explore a better optimal softening scheme based on P03 form and find that a small modification works well. This work will be useful for setting up cosmological simulations.","Tianchi Zhang, Shihong Liao, Ming Li, Liang Gao","7 pages, 4 figures, version accepted by MNRAS",1810.07055v2,No journal ref found,Liang Gao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07055v2,2018-10-16 14:53:49+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.GA,The optimal gravitational softening length for cosmological N-body   simulations,2019-05-15 12:09:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07055v2
552,"In these proceedings, we present a study of a combined singlet--doublet fermion and triplet scalar model for dark matter (DM). Together, these models form a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) that can account for DM and explain the existence of neutrino masses, which are generated radiatively. However, this also implies the existence of lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes. In addition, this particular model allows for gauge coupling unification. The new fields are odd under a new $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to stabilise the DM candidate. We analyse the DM, neutrino mass and LFV aspects, exploring the viable parameter space of the model. This is done using a numerical random scan imposing successively the neutrino mass and mixing, relic density, Higgs mass, direct detection, collider and LFV constraints. We find that DM in this model is fermionic for masses below about 1 TeV and scalar above. We observe a high degree of complementarity between direct detection and LFV experiments, which should soon allow to fully probe the fermionic DM sector and at least partially the scalar DM sector.","Juri Fiaschi, Michael Klasen, Simon May","4 pages, 1 figure; contribution to the 2019 EW session of the 54th

The mechanisms of jet formation may be divided in regular, acting continuously for a long time, and explosive ones. Continuous mechanisms are related with electrodynamics and radiation pressure acceleration, hydrodynamical acceleration in the nozzle inside a thick disk, acceleration by relativistic beam of particles. Explosive jet formation is connected with supernovae, gamma ray bursts and explosive events in galactic nuclei. Mechanisms of jet collimation may be connected with magnetic confinement, or a pressure of external gas.

554,"Stellar streams originating in disrupted dwarf galaxies and star clusters are observed around the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. Such substructures are the important tracers that record how the host haloes have accreted progenitor galaxies. Based on the cosmological context, we investigate the relationship between structural properties of substructures such as length and thinness at $z=0$, and orbits of their progenitors. We model stellar components of a large sample of substructures around Milky Way-sized haloes by combining semi-analytic models with a high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation. Using the Particle Tagging method, we embed stellar components in progenitor haloes and trace phase-space distributions of the substructures down to $z=0$. We find that the length and thinness of substructures vary smoothly as the redshift when the host haloes accrete their progenitors. For substructures observed like streams at $z=0$, a large part of the progenitors is accreted by their host haloes at redshift $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$. Substructures with progenitors out of this accretion redshift range are entirely or less disrupted by $z=0$ and cannot be observed as streams. We also find that the distributions of length and thinness of substructures vary smoothly as pericenter and apocenter of the progenitors. Substructures observed like streams tend to have the specific range of $10\ {\rm kpc} \lesssim r_{\rm peri}\lesssim100\ {\rm kpc}$ and $50\ {\rm kpc} \lesssim r_{\rm apo}\lesssim300\ {\rm kpc}$.","Yu Morinaga, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Takanobu Kirihara, Kazuki Kinjo","Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 13 pages, 10 figures, 1 table",1901.04748v3,No journal ref found,Kazuki Kinjo,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04748v3,2019-01-15 10:25:04+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,Statistical properties of substructures around Milky Way-sized haloes   and their implications for the formation of stellar streams,2019-05-15 11:22:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04748v3

556,"Observational cosmology in the next decade will rely on probes of the distribution of matter in the redshift range between $0<z<3$ to elucidate the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In this redshift range, galaxy formation is known to have a significant impact on observables such as two-point correlations of galaxy shapes and positions, altering their amplitude and scale dependence beyond the expected statistical uncertainty of upcoming experiments at separations under 10 Mpc. Successful extraction of information in such a regime thus requires, at the very least, unbiased models for the impact of galaxy formation on the matter distribution, and can benefit from complementary observational priors. This work reviews the current state of the art in the modelling of baryons for cosmology, from numerical methods to approximate analytical prescriptions, and makes recommendations for studies in the next decade, including a discussion of potential probe combinations that can help constrain the role of baryons in cosmological studies. We focus, in particular, on the modelling of the matter power spectrum, $P(k,z)$, as a function of scale and redshift, and of the observables derived from this quantity.

557,"Age estimation techniques such as gyrochronology and magnetochronology can't be applied to stars that exchanged angular momentum with their close environment. This is especially true for massive close-in planetary companion (with a periods of few days or less), which could have been strongly impacted the rotational evolution of the host star, along the stellar evolution, through the star-planet tidal interaction.   We showed that the interaction of a close-in massive planet with its host star can strongly modify the surface rotation rate of this latter, in most of the cases associated to a planetary engulfment. In such cases, a gyrochronology analysis of the star would wrongly make it appear as ""rejuvenated"", thus preventing us to use this method with confidence. To try overcome this issue, we eventually proposed the proof of concept of a new age determination technique that we call the tidal-chronology, which is based on the observed couple $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm P_{orb}$ of a given star-planet system.   The gyrochronology technique can only be applied to isolated star or star-planet systems outside a specific range of $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm P_{orb}$. This region tends to expand for increasing stellar and planetary mass. In that forbidden region, or if any planetary engulfment is suspected, gyrochronology should be used with extreme caution while tidal-chronology could be considered. While this technique does not provide a precise age for the system yet, it is already an extension of gyrochronology and could be helpful to determine a more precise range of possible age for planetary system composed of a star between 0.3 and 1.2 $M_{\odot}$ and a planet more massive than 1 $\rm M_{jup}$ initially located at few hundredth au of the host star.","Florian Gallet, Philippe Delorme","12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",1905.06070v1,No journal ref found,Philippe Delorme,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06070v1,2019-05-15 10:21:37+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Star-planet tidal interaction and the limits of gyrochronology,2019-05-15 10:21:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06070v1
558,"Microlensing of stars, e.g. in the Galactic bulge and Andromeda galaxy (M31), is among the most robust, powerful method to constrain primordial black holes (PBHs) that are a viable candidate of dark matter. If PBHs are in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH} \lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel > \over \sim \;$} 10^{-10}M_\odot$, its Schwarzschild radius ($r_{\rm Sch}$) becomes comparable with or shorter than optical wavelength ($\lambda)$ used in a microlensing search, and in this regime the wave optics effect on microlensing needs to be taken into account. For a lensing PBH with mass satisfying $r_{\rm Sch}\sim \lambda$, it causes a characteristic oscillatory feature in the microlensing light curve, and it will gives a smoking gun evidence of PBH if detected, because any astrophysical object cannot have such a tiny Schwarzshild radius. Even in a statistical study, e.g. constraining the abundance of PBHs from a systematic search of microlensing events for a sample of many source stars, the wave effect needs to be taken into account. We examined the impact of wave effect on the PBH constraints obtained from the $r$-band (6210\AA) monitoring observation of M31 stars in Niikura et al. (2019), and found that a finite source size effect is dominant over the wave effect for PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq[10^{-11},10^{-10}]M_\odot$. We also discuss that, if a denser-cadence (10~sec), $g$-band monitoring observation for a sample of white dwarfs over a year timescale is available, it would allow one to explore the wave optics effect on microlensing light curve, if it occurs, or improve the PBH constraints in $M_{\rm PBH}\lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel > \over \sim \;$} 10^{-11}M_\odot$ even from a null detection.","Sunao Sugiyama, Toshiki Kurita, Masahiro Takada","10 pages, 7 figures",1905.06066v1,No journal ref found,Masahiro Takada,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06066v1,2019-05-15 10:05:25+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Revisiting the wave optics effect on primordial black hole constraints   from optical microlensing search,2019-05-15 10:05:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06066v1

560,"Context. Earlier work suggests that slowly rotating asteroids should have higher thermal inertias than faster rotators because the heat wave penetrates deeper into the sub-surface. However, thermal inertias have been determined mainly for fast rotators due to selection effects in the available photometry used to obtain shape models required for thermophysical modelling (TPM).   Aims. Our aims are to mitigate these selection effects by producing shape models of slow rotators, to scale them and compute their thermal inertia with TPM, and to verify whether thermal inertia increases with the rotation period.   Methods. To decrease the bias against slow rotators, we conducted a photometric observing campaign of main-belt asteroids with periods longer than 12 hours, from multiple stations worldwide, adding in some cases data from WISE and Kepler space telescopes. For spin and shape reconstruction we used the lightcurve inversion method, and to derive thermal inertias we applied a thermophysical model to fit available infrared data from IRAS, AKARI, and WISE.   Results. We present new models of 11 slow rotators that provide a good fit to the thermal data. In two cases, the TPM analysis showed a clear preference for one of the two possible mirror solutions. We derived the diameters and albedos of our targets in addition to their thermal inertias, which ranged between 3$^{+33}_{-3}$ and 45$^{+60}_{-30}$ Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-1/2}$K$^{-1}$.   Conclusions. Together with our previous work, we have analysed 16 slow rotators from our dense survey with sizes between 30 and 150 km. The current sample thermal inertias vary widely, which does not confirm the earlier suggestion that slower rotators have higher thermal inertias.","A. Marciniak, V. AlÃ­-Lagoa, T. G. MÃ¼ller, R.

561,"[KKS2000]04 (NGC1052-DF2) has become a controversial and well-studied galaxy after the claims suggesting a lack of dark matter and the presence of an anomalously bright globular cluster (GC) system around it. A precise determination of its overall star formation history (SFH) as well as a better characterisation of its GC or planetary nebulae (PN) systems are crucial aspects to: i) understand its real nature, in particular placing it within the family of ultra diffuse galaxies; ii) shed light on its possible formation, evolution, and survival in the absence of dark matter. With this purpose we expand on the knowledge of [KKS2000]04 from the analysis of OSIRIS@GTC spectroscopic data. On the one hand, we claim the possible detection of two new PNe and confirm membership of 5 GCs. On the other hand, we find that the stars shaping [KKS2000]04 are intermediate-age to old (90\% of its stellar mass older than 5 Gyr, average age of 8.7 $\pm$ 0.7 Gyr) and metal-poor ([M/H] $\sim$ -1.18 $\pm$ 0.05), in general agreement with previous results.

562,"Short and long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in subclasses with specific energy release, spectra, duration, etc, and have binary progenitors. We review here the binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) subclass whose progenitor is a CO$_\textrm{core}$-neutron star (NS). The supernova (SN) explosion of the CO$_\textrm{core}$ produces at its center a new NS ($\nu$NS) and triggers a hypercritical accretion onto the NS. The NS can become a more massive NS or collapse into a black hole (BH). We summarize this topic from the first analytic estimates in 2012 to the most recent three-dimensional (3D) smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations in 2018. Long GRBs are richer and more complex than previously thought. The SN and the accretion explain X-ray precursors. The NS accretion, its collapse and the BH formation produce asymmetries in the SN ejecta, implying a 3D GRB analysis. The newborn BH surrounded by the ejecta and the magnetic field inherited from the NS, are the \emph{inner engine} from which the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) plasma and the high-energy emission initiate. The $e^+e^-$ impact on the ejecta converts the SN into a hypernova (HN). The plasma dynamics in the ejecta explains the ultrarelativistic prompt emission in the MeV domain and the mildly-relativistic flares of the early afterglow in the X-ray domain. The feedback of the $\nu$NS emission on the HN explains the X-ray late afterglow and its power-law regime. All the above is in contrast with GRB models attempting to explain all the GRB phases with the kinetic energy of anultrarelativistic jet, as traditionally proposed in the ""collapsar-fireball"" model. In addition, BdHNe in their different flavors lead to $\nu$NS-NS or $\nu$NS-BH binaries. These binaries merge by gravitational wave emission producing short GRBs, establishing a connection between long and short GRBs and their occurrence rates.","J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, Y.

563,"We study the properties of rotating accretion flows onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling and BH feedback. The simulations resolve the accretion dynamics of gas outside from the BH influence radius through an inner accretion disk. For lower Bondi accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm B}\ll 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH feeding is suppressed due to turbulent motion by several orders of magnitudes from the Bondi rate. Thus, the radiative luminosity results in as low as $\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-7}~L_{\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. For higher rates of $\dot{M}_{\rm B}> 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the optically-thin accreting gas cools via free-free emission and forms a geometrically-thin disk, which feeds the BH efficiently and increases the radiative luminosity to $> 10^{-3}~L_{\rm Edd}$. The transitional behavior of accreting BHs in galactic nuclei from radiatively inefficient phases to cold disk accretion naturally explains (1) the reason for the offset between the observed luminosities and theoretical predictions for nearby quiescent SMBHs, and (2) the conditions to fuel gas into the nuclear SMBH. In addition, the cold disk formed in galactic nuclei tends to be gravitationally unstable and leads to star formation when the Bondi rate is as high as $ \dot{M}_{\rm B} > 10^{-2}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This is a plausible explanation of the correlation observed between star formation rates and BH feeding rates in Seyfert galaxies.","Kohei Inayoshi, Kohei Ichikawa, Jeremiah P.

564,"The generation of magnetic fields is a natural consequence of the existence of vortical currents in the pre-recombination era. This has been confirmed in detail for the case of adiabatic initial conditions, using second-order Boltzmann solvers, but has not been fully explored in the presence of isocurvatures. In this work, we use a modified version of the second-order Boltzmann code SONG to compute the magnetic field generated by vortical currents for general initial conditions. A mild enhancement of the generated magnetic field is found in the presence of general isocurvature modes, when compared to the adiabatic case. A particularly interesting case is that of the compensated isocurvature mode, for which the enhancement increases by several orders of magnitude due to the observationally allowed large amplitude of those modes. We show in this particular case how these compensated modes can influence observables at second order, such as the magnetic fields, and produce interesting effects which may be used to constrain these modes in the future.","Pedro Carrilho, Karim A.

565,"We find a class of solutions for a homogeneous and isotropic universe in which the initially expanding universe stops expanding, experiences contraction, and then expands again (the ""bounce""), in the framework of Einstein gravity with a real scalar field without violating the null energy condition nor encountering any singularities. Two essential ingredients for the bouncing universe are the positive spatial curvature and the scalar potential which becomes flatter at large field values. Depending on the initial condition, either the positive curvature or the negative potential stops the cosmic expansion and begins the contraction phase. The flat potential plays a crucial role in triggering the bounce. After the bounce, the flat potential naturally allows the universe to enter the slow-roll inflation regime, thereby making the bouncing universe compatible with observations. If the e-folding of the subsequent inflation is just enough, a positive spatial curvature may be found in the future observations. Our scenario nicely fits with the creation of the universe from nothing, which leads to the homogeneous and isotropic universe with positive curvature. As a variant of the mechanism, we also find solutions representing a cyclic universe.","Hiroki Matsui, Fuminobu Takahashi, Takahiro Terada","9 pages, 4 figures; version submitted to a journal, references

566,"We present a novel algorithm that is based on a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for performing robust profile analysis of a data cube from either single-dish or interferometric radio telescopes. It fits a set of models comprised of a number of Gaussian components given by the user to individual line-of-sight velocity profiles, then compares them and finds an optimal model based on the Bayesian Inference Criteria computed for each model.The decomposed Gaussian components are then classified into bulk or non-circular motions as well as kinematically cold or warm components. The fitting based on the Bayesian MCMC technique is insensitive to initial estimates of the parameters, and suffers less from finding the global minimum in models given enough sampling points and a wide range of priors for the parameters. It is found to provide reliable profile decomposition and classification of the decomposed components in a fully automated way, together with robust error estimation of the parameters as shown by performance tests using artificial data cubes. We apply the newly developed algorithm to the HI data cubes of sample galaxies from the Local Volume HI galaxy Survey (LVHIS). We also compare the kinematically cold and warm components, and bulk velocity fields with previous analyses made in a classical method.","Se-Heon Oh, Lister Staveley-Smith, Bi-Qing For","14 pages, 11 figures",1905.06036v1,No journal ref found,Bi-Qing For,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06036v1,2019-05-15 09:01:16+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Robust profile decomposition for large extragalactic spectral-line   surveys,2019-05-15 09:01:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06036v1
567,"The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is a favorable target for the atmospheric characterization of temperate earth-sized exoplanets by means of transmission spectroscopy with the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). A possible obstacle to this technique could come from the photospheric heterogeneity of the host star that could affect planetary signatures in the transit transmission spectra. To constrain further this possibility, we gathered an extensive photometric data set of 25 TRAPPIST-1 transits observed in the near-IR J band (1.2 $\mu$m) with the UKIRT and the AAT, and in the NB2090 band (2.1 $\mu$m) with the VLT during the period 2015-2018. In our analysis of these data, we used a special strategy aiming to ensure uniformity in our measurements and robustness in our conclusions. We reach a photometric precision of $\sim0.003$ (RMS of the residuals), and we detect no significant temporal variations of transit depths of TRAPPIST-1 b, c, e, and g over the period of three years. The few transit depths measured for planets d and f hint towards some level of variability, but more measurements will be required for confirmation. Our depth measurements for planets b and c disagree with the stellar contamination spectra originating from the possible existence of bright spots of temperature 4500 K. We report updated transmission spectra for the six inner planets of the system which are globally flat for planets b and g and some structures are seen for planets c, d, e, and f.","A. Y.

568,"We present ALMA Band 6 observations of the CO(2-1), HCN(3-2), and HCO$^{+}$(3-2) lines in the nearby radio galaxy / brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of NGC~1275 with the spatial resolution of $\sim20$~pc. In the previous observations, CO(2-1) emission was detected as radial filaments lying in the east-west direction. We resolved the inner filament and found that the filament cannot be represented by a simple infalling stream both morphologically and kinematically. The observed complex nature of the filament resembles the cold gas structure predicted by recent numerical simulations of cold chaotic accretion. A crude estimate suggests that the accretion rate of the cold gas can be higher than that of hot gas. Within the central 100~pc, we detected a rotational disk of the molecular gas whose mass is $\sim10^{8}~M_{\sun}$. This is the first evidence of the presence of massive cold gas disk on this spatial scale for BCGs. The disk rotation axis is approximately consistent with the axis of the radio jet on subpc scales. This probably suggests that the cold gas disk is physically connected to the innermost accretion disk which is responsible for jet launching. We also detected absorption features in the HCN(3-2) and HCO$^{+}$(3-2) spectra against the radio continuum emission mostly radiated by $\sim1.2$-pc size jet. The absorption features are blue-shifted from the systemic velocity by $\sim$300-600~km~s$^{-1}$, which suggests the presence of outflowing gas from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We discuss the relation of the AGN feeding with cold accretion, the origin of blue-shifted absorption, and estimate of black hole mass using the molecular gas dynamics.","H. Nagai, K. Onishi, N.

569,"Accurate and fast gravitational waveform (GW) models are essential to extract information about the properties of compact binary systems that generate GWs. Building on previous work, we present an extension of the NRTidal model for binary neutron star (BNS) waveforms. The upgrades are: (i) a new closed-form expression for the tidal contribution to the GW phase which includes further analytical knowledge and is calibrated to more accurate numerical relativity data than previously available; (ii) a tidal correction to the GW amplitude; (iii) an extension of the spin-sector incorporating equation-of-state-dependent finite size effects at quadrupolar and octupolar order; these appear in the spin-spin tail terms and cubic-in-spin terms, both at 3.5PN. We add the new description to the precessing binary black hole waveform model IMRPhenomPv2 to obtain a frequency-domain precessing binary neutron star model. In addition, we extend the SEOBNRv4_ROM and IMRPhenomD aligned-spin binary black hole waveform models with the improved tidal phase corrections. Focusing on the new IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2 approximant, we test the model by comparing with numerical relativity waveforms as well as hybrid waveforms combining tidal effective-one-body and numerical relativity data. We also check consistency against a tidal effective-one-body model across large regions of the BNS parameter space.","Tim Dietrich, Anuradha Samajdar, Sebastian Khan, Nathan K.

570,"Observationally, for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, so far, the correlation between the radio luminosity $L_{\rm R}$ and the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$, i.e., $L_{\rm R}\propto L_{\rm X}^{\beta}$, has been reasonably well-established only in three sources 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and EXO 1745-248 in their hard state. The slope $\beta$ of the radio/X-ray correlation of the three sources is different, i.e., $\beta \sim 1.4$ for 4U 1728-34, $\beta \sim 0.4$ for Aql X-1, and $\beta \sim 1.6$ for EXO 1745-248. In this paper, for the first time we explain the different radio/X-ray correlation of 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and EXO 1745-248 with the coupled advection-dominated accretion (ADAF)-jet model respectively. We calculate the emergent spectrum of the ADAF-jet model for $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm R}$ at different $\dot m$ ($\dot m=\dot M/\dot M_{\rm Edd}$), adjusting $\eta$ ($\eta \equiv \dot M_{\rm jet}/\dot M$, describing the fraction of the accreted matter in the ADAF transfered vertically forming the jet) to fit the observed radio/X-ray correlations. Then we derive a fitting formula of $\eta$ as a function of $\dot m$ for 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and EXO 1745-248 respectively. If the relation between $\eta$ and $\dot m$ can be extrapolated down to a lower value of $\dot m$, we find that in a wide range of $\dot m$, the value of $\eta$ in Aql X-1 is greater than that of in 4U 1728-34 and EXO 1745-248, implying that Aql X-1 may have a relatively stronger large-scale magnetic field, which is supported by the discovery of the coherent millisecond X-ray pulsation in Aql X-1.","Erlin Qiao, B.

571,"We present high resolution spectroscopy of the yellow symbiotic star AG Draconis with ESPaDOnS at the {\it Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope}. Our analysis is focused on the profiles of Raman scattered \ion{O}{VI} features centered at 6825 \AA\ and 7082 \AA, which are formed through Raman scattering of \ion{O}{VI}$\lambda\lambda$1032 and 1038 with atomic hydrogen. These features are found to exhibit double component profiles with conspicuously enhanced red parts. Assuming that the \ion{O}{vi} emission region constitutes a part of the accretion flow around the white dwarf, Monte Carlo simulations for \ion{O}{VI} line radiative transfer are performed to find that the overall profiles are well fit with the accretion flow azimuthally asymmetric with more matter on the entering side than on the opposite side. As the mass loss rate of the giant component is increased, we find that the flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082)$ of Raman 6825 and 7082 features decreases and that our observational data are consistent with a mass loss rate $\dot M\sim 2 \times 10^{-7} {\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$. We also find that additional bipolar components moving away with a speed $\sim 70{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$ provide considerably improved fit to the red wing parts of Raman features. The possibility that the two Raman profiles differ is briefly discussed in relation to the local variation of the \ion{O}{VI} doublet flux ratio.","Young-Min Lee, Hee-Won Lee, Ho-Gyu Lee, Rodolfo Angeloni","12 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.05993v1,No journal ref found,Rodolfo Angeloni,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05993v1,2019-05-15 07:33:35+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Stellar Wind Accretion and Raman Scattered O VI Features in the   Symbiotic Star AG Draconis,2019-05-15 07:33:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05993v1
572,"Linear analysis of the stability of diffuse clouds in the cold neutral medium with uniform magnetic field is performed. We consider that gas in equilibrium state is heated by cosmic rays, X-rays and electronic photoeffect on the surface of dust grains, and it is cooled by the collisional excitation of fine levels of the CII. Ionization by cosmic rays and radiative recombinations is taken into account. A dispersion equation is solved analytically in the limiting cases of small and large wave numbers, as well as numerically in the general case. In particular cases the dispersion equation describes thermal instability of Field (1965) and ionization-coupled acoustic instability of Flannery and Press (1979). We pay our attention to magnetosonic waves arising in presence of magnetic field, in thermally stable region, $35 \leq T \leq 95$ K and density $n\lessapprox 10^3\,\mbox{cm}^{-3}$. We have shown that these modes can be unstable in the isobarically stable medium. The instability mechanism is similar to the mechanism of ionization-coupled acoustic instability. We determine maximum growth rates and critical wavelengths of the instability of magnetosonic waves depending on gas temperature, magnetic field strength and the direction of wave vector with respect to the magnetic field lines. The minimum growth time of the unstable slow magnetosonic waves in diffuse clouds is of $4-60$ Myr, minimum and the most unstable wavelengths lie in ranges $0.05-0.5$ and $0.5-5$ pc, respectively. We discuss the application of considered instability to the formation of small-scale structures and the generation of MHD turbulence in the cold neutral medium.","Alexander E. Dudorov, Constantine E.

573,"Aiming for a new and more comprehensive DIB catalog between 4,000 and 9,000{\AA}, we revisited the Atlas Catalog based on the observations of HD 183143 and HD 204827 (Hobbs et al. 2008 and 2009). Twenty-five medium-to-highly reddened sight lines were selected, sampling a variety of spectral types of the background star and the interstellar environments. The median SNR of these spectra is ~ 1,300 around 6,400{\AA}. Compared to the Atlas Catalog, 22 new DIBs were found, and the boundaries of 27 (sets) of DIBs were adjusted, resulting in an updated catalog containing 559 DIBs that we refer to as the Apache Point Observatory Catalog of Optical Diffuse Interstellar Bands. Measurements were then made based on this catalog. We found our survey most sensitive between 5,500 and 7,000{\AA} due largely to the local SNR of the spectra, the relative absence of interfering stellar lines, and the weakness of telluric residuals. For our data sample, the number of DIBs detected in a given sight line is mostly dependent on EB-V and less on the spectral type of the background star. Some dependence on fH2 is observed, but less well-determined due to the limited size of the data sample. The variations of the wavelengths of each DIB in different sight lines are generally larger than those of the known interstellar lines CH+, CH, and K I. Those variations could be due to the inherent error in the measurement, or to differences in the velocity components among sight lines.","Haoyu Fan, L. M. Hobbs, Julie A. Dahlstrom, Daniel E.

574,"We report the discovery of the planet OGLE-2018-BLG-0532Lb, with very obvious signatures in the light curve that lead to an estimate of the planet-host mass ratio $q=M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm host}\simeq 1\times10^{-4}$. Although there are no obvious systematic residuals to this double-lens/single-source (2L1S) fit, we find that $\chi^2$ can be significantly improved by adding either a third lens (3L1S, $\Delta\chi^2=81$) or second source (2L2S, $\Delta\chi^2=65$) to the lens-source geometry. After thorough investigation, we conclude that we cannot decisively distinguish between these two scenarios and therefore focus on the robustly-detected planet. However, given the possible presence of a second planet, we investigate to what degree and with what probability such additional planets may affect seemingly single-planet light curves. Our best estimates for the properties of the lens star and the secure planet are: a host mass $M\sim 0.25\,M_\odot$, system distance $D_L\sim 1\,$kpc and planet mass $m_{p,1}= 8\,M_\oplus$ with projected separation $a_{1,\perp}=1.4\,$au. However, there is a relatively bright $I=18.6$ (and also relatively blue) star projected within $<50\,$mas of the lens, and if future high-resolution images show that this is coincident with the lens, then it is possible that it is the lens, in which case, the lens would be both more massive and more distant than the best-estimated values above.","Yoon-Hyun Ryu, Andrzej Udalski, Jennifer C.

We therefore study the contribution of the crust to the tidal deformability and the moment of inertia of a neutron star for a variety of well-known equations of state. It is found that the contributions to these quantities from the low density crust are typically quite small and as a result the determination of the tidal deformability provides an important constraint on the equation of state of dense matter.","A.

577,"A central compact object (CCO, e.g. a black hole) with an accretion disk has been suggested as the common central engine of various astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A jet powered by such a system might precess due to the misalignment of the angular momenta of the CCO and accretion disk. Some quasi-periodic behaviors observed in the light curves of these phenomena can be well interpreted within the framework of a precessing jet model. In this paper, we study the emission polarization of precessing jets in the three kinds of phenomena. The polarization angle also shows a gradual change for the synchrotron emission in both the random and toroidal magnetic field configurations with the precessing jet, while it can only change abruptly by $90^\circ$ for the non-precessing top-hat jet. Polarization properties are periodic due to the assumptions made in our model. The polarization observations are crucial to confirm the precession nature of jets in GRBs, TDEs and AGNs.","Mi-Xiang Lan, Rui Xue, Dingrong Xiong, Wei-Hua Lei, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai","21 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ApJ",1905.05905v1,No journal ref found,Zi-Gao Dai,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05905v1,2019-05-15 01:25:12+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Polarization of Astrophysical Events with Precessing Jets,2019-05-15 01:25:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05905v1
578,"We investigate the bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies using the distribution of log($L_{H\alpha}/L_{UV}$) of 185 local galaxies. We expand on the work of Weisz et al. 2012 to consider a wider range of SFHs and stellar metallicities, and show that there are large degeneracies in a periodic, top-hat burst model. We argue that all galaxies of a given mass have similar SFHs and we can therefore include the $L_{H\alpha}$ distributions (subtracting the median trend with stellar mass, referred to as $\Delta \text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$) in our analyses. $\Delta \text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$ traces the amplitude of the bursts, and log($L_{H\alpha}/L_{UV}$) is a function of timescale, amplitude, and shape of the bursts. We examine the 2-dimensional distribution of these two indicators constrain the SFHs. We use exponentially rising/falling bursts to determine timescales ($e$-folding time, $\tau$). We find that galaxies below $10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ undergo large (amplitudes of $\sim 100$) and rapid ($\tau < 30$ Myr) bursts, while galaxies above $10^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ experience smaller (maximum amplitudes $\sim 10$), slower ($\tau \gtrsim 300$ Myr) bursts. We compare to the FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulations and find that the burst amplitudes agree with observations, but they are too rapid in more massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$). Finally, we confirm that stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function can not reproduce the observed distributions unless the standard assumptions of cluster and stellar mass functions are changed. With the next generation of telescopes, measurements of $L_{UV}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$ will become available for dwarf galaxies at high-redshift, enabling similar analyses of galaxies in the early universe.","Najmeh Emami, Brian Siana, Daniel R.

579,"Previous studies of planet occurrence rates largely relied on photometric stellar characterizations. In this paper, we present planet occurrence rates for mid-type M dwarfs using spectroscopy, parallaxes, and photometry to determine stellar characteristics. Our spectroscopic observations have allowed us to constrain spectral type, temperatures, and in some cases metallicities for 337 out of 561 probable mid-type M dwarfs in the primary Kepler field. We use a random forest classifier to assign a spectral type to the remaining 224 stars. Combining our data with Gaia parallaxes, we compute precise ($\sim$3%) stellar radii and masses, which we use to update planet parameters and planet occurrence rates for Kepler mid-type M dwarfs. Within the Kepler field, there are seven M3 V to M5 V stars which host 13 confirmed planets between 0.5 and 2.5 Earth radii and at orbital periods between 0.5 and 10 days. For this population, we compute a planet occurrence rate of $1.19^{+0.70}_{-0.49}$ planets per star. For M3 V, M4 V, and M5 V, we compute planet occurrence rates of $0.86^{+1.32}_{-0.68}$, $1.36^{+2.30}_{-1.02}$, and $3.07^{+5.49}_{-2.49}$ planets per star, respectively.","Kevin K.

580,"In a companion paper by Koposov et al., RR Lyrae from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 2 are used to demonstrate that stars in the Orphan stream have velocity vectors significantly misaligned with the stream track, suggesting that it has received a large gravitational perturbation from a satellite of the Milky Way. We argue that such a mismatch cannot arise due to any realistic static Milky Way potential and then explore the perturbative effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the LMC can produce precisely the observed motion-track mismatch and we therefore use the Orphan stream to measure the mass of the Cloud. We simultaneously fit the Milky Way and LMC potentials and infer that a total LMC mass of $1.38^{+0.27}_{-0.24} \times10^{11}\,\rm{M_\odot}$ is required to bend the Orphan Stream, showing for the first time that the LMC has a large and measurable effect on structures orbiting the Milky Way. This has far-reaching consequences for any technique which assumes that tracers are orbiting a static Milky Way. Furthermore, we measure the Milky Way mass within 50 kpc to be $3.80^{+0.14}_{-0.11}\times10^{11} M_\odot$.

581,"We present NKBB, an XSPEC model for the thermal spectrum of thin accretion disks in parametric black hole spacetimes. We employ the Novikov-Thorne model for the description of the accretion disk and the formalism of the transfer function proposed by Cunningham for storing all the relativistic effects of the spacetime metric. The current version of the model assumes the Johannsen metric, but it can be easily extended to any stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime without pathological properties. The model can be used within the XSPEC package to test the Kerr nature of astrophysical black holes with the continuum-fitting method.","Menglei Zhou, Askar B.

582,"We present deep, multiwavelength radio observations of SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, a z = 1.71 galaxy cluster with a starbusting core. Observations were made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in 3 bands: 1-2 GHz, 4-8 GHz and 8-12 GHz. We detect a radio source coincident with the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) that has a spectral index of {\alpha}=0.44\pm 0.29 and is indicative of emission from an Active Galactic Nucleus. The radio luminosity is consistent with the average luminosity of the lower redshift BCG sample, but the flux densities are 6{\sigma} below the predicted values of the star-forming Spectral Energy Distribution based on far infrared data. Our new fit fails to simultaneously describe the far infrared and radio fluxes. This, coupled with the fact that no other bright source is detected in the vicinity of the BCG implies that the star formation region, traced by the infrared emission, is extended or clumpy and not located directly within the BCG. Thus, we suggest that the star-forming core might not be driven by a single major wet merger, but rather by several smaller galaxies stripped of their gas or by a displaced cooling flow, although more data are needed to confirm any of those scenarios.","Ariane Trudeau, Tracy Webb, Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo, Allison Noble, Marie-Lou Gendron-Marsolais, Christopher Lidman, Mar Mezcua, Adam Muzzin, Gillian Wilson, H.

583,"We report the discovery of a $Spitzer$ microlensing planet OGLE-2018-BLG-0596Lb, with preferred planet-host mass ratio $q \sim 2\times10^{-4}$. The planetary signal, which is characterized by a short $(\sim 1~{\rm day})$ ""bump"" on the rising side of the lensing light curve, was densely covered by ground-based surveys. We find that the signal can be explained by a bright source that fully envelops the planetary caustic, i.e., a ""Hollywood"" geometry. Combined with the source proper motion measured from $Gaia$, the $Spitzer$ satellite parallax measurement makes it possible to precisely constrain the lens physical parameters. The preferred solution, in which the planet perturbs the minor image due to lensing by the host, yields a Uranus-mass planet with a mass of $M_{\rm p} = 13.9\pm1.6~M_{\oplus}$ orbiting a mid M-dwarf with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.23\pm0.03~M_{\odot}$. There is also a second possible solution that is substantially disfavored but cannot be ruled out, for which the planet perturbs the major image. The latter solution yields $M_{\rm p} = 1.2\pm0.2~M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\rm h} = 0.15\pm0.02~M_{\odot}$. By combining the microlensing and $Gaia$ data together with a Galactic model, we find in either case that the lens lies on the near side of the Galactic bulge at a distance $D_{\rm L} \sim 6\pm1~{\rm kpc}$. Future adaptive optics observations may decisively resolve the major image/minor image degeneracy.","Youn Kil Jung, Andrew Gould, Andrzej Udalski, Takahiro Sumi, Jennifer C.

We find stable niches where small bodies can survive even for very high eccentricities. Mean motion resonances play a fundamental role providing stability against the planetary perturbations specially for high inclination orbits. A stability stripe around i=150 is present all along the Solar System.

585,"We present the result of calculations to optimize the search for molecular oxygen (O2) in Earth analogs transiting around nearby, low-mass stars using ground-based, high-resolution, Doppler shift techniques. We investigate a series of parameters, namely spectral resolution, wavelength coverage of the observations, and sky coordinates and systemic velocity of the exoplanetary systems, to find the values that optimize detectability of O2. We find that increasing the spectral resolution of observations to R = 300,000 - 400,000 from the typical R ~ 100,000, more than doubles the average depth of O2 lines in planets with atmospheres similar to Earth's. Resolutions higher than about 500,000 do not produce significant gains in the depths of the O2 lines. We confirm that observations in the O2 A-band are the most efficient except for M9V host stars, for which observations in the O2 NIR-band are more efficient. Combining observations in the O2 A, B, and NIR -bands can reduce the number of transits needed to produce a detection of O2 by about 1/3 in the case of white noise limited observations. However, that advantage disappears in the presence of typical levels of red noise. Therefore, combining observations in more than one band produces no significant gains versus observing only in the A-band, unless red-noise can be significantly reduced. Blending between the exoplanet's O2 lines and telluric O2 lines is a known problem. We find that problem can be alleviated by increasing the resolution of the observations, and by giving preference to targets near the ecliptic.","Mercedes Lopez-Morales, Sagi Ben-Ami, Gonzalo Gonzalez-Abad, Juliana Garcia-Mejia, Jeremy Dietrich, Andrew Szentgyorgyi","15 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in The Astronomical

586,"We show how a neural network can be trained to Wiener filter masked CMB maps to high accuracy. We propose an innovative neural network architecture, the WienerNet, which guarantees linearity in the data map. Our method does not require Wiener filtered training data, but rather learns Wiener filtering from tailored loss functions which are mathematically guaranteed to be minimized by the exact solution. Once trained, the neural network Wiener filter is extremely fast, about a factor of 1000 faster than the standard conjugate gradient method. Wiener filtering is the computational bottleneck in many optimal CMB analyses, including power spectrum estimation, lensing and non-Gaussianities, and our method could potentially be used to speed them up by orders of magnitude with minimal loss of optimality. The method should also be useful to analyze other statistical fields in cosmology.","Moritz MÃ¼nchmeyer, Kendrick M. Smith","15 pages, 7 figures",1905.05846v1,No journal ref found,Kendrick M.

587,"Measuring the properties of protoplanetary disks around brown dwarfs is central to understanding the formation of brown dwarfs and their planetary companions. We present modeling of CFHT Tau 4 and 2M0444, two brown dwarfs with protoplanetary disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. By combining modeling of the spectral energy distributions and ALMA images, we obtain disk radii and masses for these objects; these parameters can be used to constrain brown dwarf formation and planet formation, respectively. We find that the disk around CFHT Tau 4 has a mass of 0.42 M$_{Jup}$ and a radius of 80 au; we find 2M0444's disk to have a mass of 2.05 M$_{Jup}$ and a radius of 100 au. These radii are more consistent with those predicted by theoretical simulations of brown dwarf formation via undisturbed condensation from a mass reservoir than those predicted by ejection from the formation region. Furthermore, the disk mass of 2M0444 suggests that planet formation may be possible in this disk, although the disk of 2M0444 is likely not massive enough to form planets. The disk properties measured here provide constraints to theoretical models of brown dwarf formation and the formation of their planetary companions.","Anneliese M. Rilinger, Catherine C.

588,"The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) states that galaxies of the same stellar mass but larger star formation rate (SFR) tend to have smaller gas-phase metallicity (<Zg>). It is thought to be fundamental because it naturally arises from the stochastic feeding of star-formation from external metal-poor gas accretion, a process extremely elusive to observe but essential according the cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. In this letter, we show how the FMR emerges from the local anti-correlation between SFR surface density and Zg recently observed to exist in disk galaxies. We analytically derive the global FMR from the local law, and then show that both relations agree quantitatively when considering the star-forming galaxies of the MaNGA survey. Thus, understanding the FMR becomes equivalent to understanding the origin of the anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity followed by the set of star-forming regions of any typical galaxy. The correspondence between local and global laws is not specific of the FMR, so that a number of local relations should exist associated with known global relations.","J. Sanchez Almeida, L.

589,"Before we have determined that giant radio structure is typical for steep-spectrum sources detected with Ukrainian T-shaped Radio Telescope of model 2 (UTR-2). To estimate the jet propagation velocity and environment density of giant radio sources we consider the sample of galaxies and quasars with steep radio spectrum compiled from two regions of UTR-2 catalogue. The value of velocity of jet propagation is obtained from our estimates of linear size of radio structure and characteristic age of a source. We use the obtained values of jet propagation velocity for the estimates of density of jet environment, that is, density of environment at galaxies and quasars outskirts. We have derived that values of jet propagation velocities of examined sources are ~10e9 cm/s. The positive correlation of jet velocity and redshift of sources is displayed in our sample. On the assumption of equality of jet luminosity and corresponding kinetic luminosity we estimate the density of jet environment (radio structure environment) for galaxies (10e-26 gcm-3 to 10e-27 gcm-3) and quasars (10e-28 gcm-3). Considered steep-spectrum galaxies and quasars display strong evolution of jet propagation velocity and jet environment density. Properties of giant steep-spectrum sources are in accordance with conception of long evolution of powerful sources.

In a correlation analysis of our datasets (which use the broadband mode covering J through K band in a single spectrum), we find that chromaticity in the SCExAO/CHARIS system is generally worse than temporal stability. We also develop a point spread function (PSF) subtraction pipeline optimized for the CHARIS broadband mode, including a forward modelling-based exoplanet algorithmic throughput correction scheme. We then present contrast curves using this newly developed pipeline. An analogous subtraction of the same datasets using only the H band slices yields the same final contrasts as the full JHK sequences; this result is consistent with our chromaticity analysis, illustrating that PSF subtraction using spectral differential imaging (SDI) in this broadband mode is generally not more effective than SDI in the individual J, H, or K bands. In the future, the data processing framework and analysis developed in this paper will be important to consider for additional SCExAO/CHARIS broadband observations and other ExAO instruments which plan to implement a similar integral field spectrograph broadband mode.","Benjamin L.

591,"The hot WN star WR2 (HD6327) has been claimed to have many singular characteristics. To explain its unusually rounded and relatively weak emission line profiles, it has been proposed that WR2 is rotating close to break-up with a magnetically confined wind. Alternatively, the line profiles could be explained by the dilution of WR2's spectrum by that of a companion. In this paper, we present a study of WR2 using near-infrared AO imaging and optical spectroscopy and polarimetry. Our spectra reveal the presence of weak photospheric absorption lines from a ~B2.5-4V companion, which however contributes only ~5-10% to the total light, suggesting that the companion is a background object. Therefore, its flux cannot be causing any significant dilution of the WR star's emission lines. The absence of intrinsic linear continuum polarization from WR2 does not support the proposed fast rotation. Our Stokes V spectrum was not of sufficient quality to test the presence of a moderately strong organized magnetic field but our new modelling indicates that to confine the wind the putative magnetic field must be significantly stronger than was previously suggested sufficiently strong as to make its presence implausible.","A. -N.

592,"The DEAP-3600 experiment is searching for WIMP dark matter with a 3.3 tonne single phase liquid argon (LAr) target, located 2.1 km underground at SNOLAB. The experimental signature of dark matter interactions is keV-scale $^{40}$Ar nuclear recoils (NR) producing 128 nm LAr scintillation photons observed by PMTs. The largest backgrounds in DEAP-3600 are electronic recoils (ER) induced by $\beta$ and $\gamma$-rays originating from internal and external radioactivity in the detector material. A background model of the ER interactions in DEAP-3600 was developed and is described in this work. The model is based on several components which are expected from radioisotopes in the LAr, from ex-situ material assay measurements, and from dedicated independent in-situ analyses. This prior information is used in a Bayesian fit of the ER components to a 247.2 d dataset to model the radioactivity in the surrounding detector materials. While excellent discrimination between ERs and NRs is reached with pulse shape discrimination, utilizing the large difference between fast and slow components of LAr scintillation light, detailed knowledge of the ER background and activity of detector components, sets valuable constraints on other key types of backgrounds in the detector: neutrons and alphas. In addition, the activity of $^{42}$Ar in LAr in DEAP-3600 is determined by measuring the daughter decay of $^{42}$K. This cosmogenically activated trace isotope is a relevant background at higher energies for other rare event searches using atmospheric argon e.g. DarkSide-20k, GERDA or LEGEND.

If we want to truly understand the role of the CGM in the early evolution of galaxies and galaxy-clusters, we need to fully explore the multi-phase nature of the CGM. We present two novel science cases that utilize low-surface-brightness observations in the radio regime to better understand the CGM around distant galaxies. At the lowest temperatures, observations of widespread molecular gas are providing evidence for the cold baryon cycle that grows massive galaxies. At the highest temperatures, observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect are starting to reveal the effect of quasar feedback onto the hot gas in the CGM.

With at least $\sim1,000,000$ new light curves generated every month from full frame images alone, automated planet candidate identification has become an attractive alternative to human vetting. Here we present a deep learning model capable of performing triage and vetting on TESS candidates. Our model is modified from an existing neural network designed to automatically classify Kepler candidates, and is the first neural network to be trained and tested on real TESS data.

595,"We present a new relativistic radiative-transfer code for $\gamma$-rays of energy less than 5 MeV in supernova (SN) ejecta. This code computes the opacities, the prompt emissivity (i.e. decay), and the scattering emissivity, and solves for the intensity in the co-moving frame. Because of the large expansion velocities of SN ejecta, we ignore redistribution effects associated with thermal motions. The energy deposition is calculated from the energy removed from the radiation field by scattering or photoelectric absorption. This new code yields comparable results to an independent Monte Carlo code. However, both yield non-trivial differences with the results from a pure absorption treatment of $\gamma$-ray transport. A synthetic observer's frame spectrum is also produced from the CMF intensity. At early times when the optical depth to $\gamma$-rays is large, the synthetic spectrum show asymmetric line profiles with redshifted absorption as seen in SN 2014J. This new code is integrated within CMFGEN and allows for an accurate and fast computation of the decay energy deposition in SN ejecta.","Kevin D. Wilk, D.

596,"We report measurements of the bulk radial velocity from a sample of small, metal-rich ejecta knots in Kepler's Supernova Remnant (SNR). We measure the Doppler shift of the He-like Si K$\alpha$ line center energy in the spectra of these knots from our $Chandra$ High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observation to estimate their radial velocities. We estimate high radial velocities of up to $\sim$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ for some of these ejecta knots. We also measure proper motions for our sample based on the archival $Chandra$ Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data taken in 2000, 2006, and 2014. Our measured radial velocities and proper motions indicate that some of these ejecta knots are nearly freely-expanding after $\sim$ 400 years since the explosion. The fastest moving knots showed proper motions up to $\sim$ 0.2 arcseconds per year. Based on our radial velocity measurements, we estimate a distance to Kepler's SNR, $d$ $\sim$ 4.8 to 8.2 kpc. We find that the ejecta knots in our sample have an average space velocity of $\mid v_{s}\mid \sim$ 4,600 km s$^{-1}$ (at a distance of 6 kpc). We note that 8 out of the 15 ejecta knots from our sample show a statistically significant (at the 90$\%$ confidence level) redshifted spectrum, compared to only 2 with a blueshifted spectrum, suggesting an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution in Kepler's SNR along the line of sight.","Matthew J.

597,"Extreme magnifications of distant objects by factors of several thousand have recently become a reality. Small very luminous compact objects, such as supernovae (SNe), giant stars at z=1-2, Pop III stars at z>7 and even gravitational waves from merging binary black holes near caustics of gravitational lenses can be magnified to many thousands or even tens of thousands thanks to their small size. We explore the probability of such extreme magnifications in a cosmological context including also the effect of microlenses near critical curves. We show how a natural limit to the maximum magnification appears due to the presence of microlenses near critical curves. We use a combination of state of the art halo mass functions, high-resolution analytical models for the density profiles and inverse ray tracing to estimate the probability of magnification near caustics. We estimate the rate of highly-magnified events in the case of SNe, GW and very luminous stars including Pop III stars.

598,"The first detected gravitational wave GW 170817 from a binary neutron star merger is associated with an important optical transient AT2017gfo, which is a direct observation of kilonova. The recent observations suggest that the remnant compact object of the binary neutron star merger associated with GW 170817/GRB 170817A may be a stable long-lived magnetized neutron star. In this situation, there would be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) embedded inside the dynamic ejecta. Then, we study the effect of the PWN emission on the observed light curves and radiation spectra. It is found that the characteristic emission of the embedded PWN quickly evolves. For the multi-band and longterm observations of AT2017gfo, we find that the dynamic ejecta with a PWN emission can fit the observational data very well, especially for the light curves at $t\sim 5$ days and those in the late phase.

599,"The microlensing parallax campaign with the $Spitzer$ space telescope aims to measure masses and distances of microlensing planetary events seen towards the Galactic bulge. The hope is to measure how the distribution of planets depends on position within the Galaxy. In this paper, we compare 50 microlens parallax measurements from 2015 $Spitzer$ campaign to three different Galactic models commonly used in microlensing analyses, and we find that $\geq 80\,$\% of these events have microlensing parallax values higher than the medians predicted by Galactic models. We use the Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on the distributions of the prior probability that the each of the $Spitzer$ parallax measurements is at least as large as the observed microlensing parallax values. These tests indicate probabilities of $p_{\rm AD} < 3.0 \times 10^{-8}$ and $p_{\rm KS} < 4.1 \times 10^{-6}$ that the data are consistent with these Galactic models from the AD and KS tests respectively. Given that many $Spitzer$ light curves show evidence of large correlated errors, we conclude that this discrepancy is probably due to systematic errors in the $Spitzer$ photometry. We consider a simple scheme to correct for this problem by multiplying the reported error bars on the $Spitzer$ microlensing parallax measurements by a constant factor, and we find that an error bar renormalization factor of 3.4 provides reasonable agreement with all three Galactic models. We expect, however, that corrections to the uncertainties in the $Spitzer$ photometry itself are likely to be a more effective way to address the systematic errors. We also argue that is important to include the ${\bm \pi_{\rm E}}$ prior distributions when analyzing events with large uncertainties or degeneracies in ${\bm \pi_{\rm E}}$ measurements.","Naoki Koshimoto, David Bennett","29 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, submitted to AJ",1905.05794v1,No journal ref found,David Bennett,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05794v1,2019-05-14 18:50:34+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Evidence of Systematic Errors in $Spitzer$ Microlens Parallax   Measurements,2019-05-14 18:50:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05794v1
600,"The detection of periodic signals from transiting exoplanets is often impeded by extraneous aperiodic photometric variability, either intrinsic to the star or arising from the measurement process. Frequently, these variations are autocorrelated wherein later flux values are correlated with previous ones. In this work, we present the methodology of the Autoregessive Planet Search (ARPS) project which uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and related statistical models that treat a wide variety of stochastic processes, as well as nonstationarity, to improve detection of new planetary transits. Providing a time series is evenly spaced or can be placed on an evenly spaced grid with missing values, these low-dimensional parametric models can prove very effective. We introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect periodic transits in the residuals after the application of ARIMA models. Our matched-filter algorithm, the Transit Comb Filter (TCF), is closely related to the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares and provides an analogous periodogram. Finally, if a previously identified or simulated sample of planets is available, selected scalar features from different stages of the analysis -- the original light curves, ARIMA fits, TCF periodograms, and folded light curves -- can be collectively used with a multivariate classifier to identify promising candidates while efficiently rejecting false alarms. We use Random Forests for this task, in conjunction with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, to define discovery criteria for new, high fidelity planetary candidates. The ARPS methodology can be applied to both evenly spaced satellite light curves and densely cadenced ground-based photometric surveys.","Gabriel A. Caceres, Eric D. Feigelson, G.

601,"We present global analyses of effective Higgs portal dark matter models in the frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. Complementing earlier studies of the scalar Higgs portal, we use GAMBIT to determine the preferred mass and coupling ranges for models with vector, Majorana and Dirac fermion dark matter. We also assess the relative plausibility of all four models using Bayesian model comparison. Our analysis includes up-to-date likelihood functions for the dark matter relic density, invisible Higgs decays, and direct and indirect searches for weakly-interacting dark matter including the latest XENON1T data. We also account for important uncertainties arising from the local density and velocity distribution of dark matter, nuclear matrix elements relevant to direct detection, and Standard Model masses and couplings. In all Higgs portal models, we find parameter regions that can explain all of dark matter and give a good fit to all data. The case of vector dark matter requires the most tuning and is therefore slightly disfavoured from a Bayesian point of view. In the case of fermionic dark matter, we find a strong preference for including a CP-violating phase that allows suppression of constraints from direct detection experiments, with odds in favour of CP violation of the order of 100:1.

Stellar velocity dispersions were measured directly from the Mg Ib region, taking into consideration the effect of Fe II contamination, AGN dilution, and host-galaxy morphology on our measurements. Black hole masses are estimated using the H$\beta$ line width, and the luminosity at 5100 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$ is estimated from surface brightness decomposition of the active-galactic nucleus (AGN) from the host galaxy using high-resolution imaging from Hubble Space Telescope. Additionally, we investigate the use of [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission line width as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion, finding better correlation once corrected for Fe II contamination and any possible blueshifted wing components. Our selection criteria allowed us to probe lower-luminosity AGN and lower-mass BHs in the non-local universe than those measured in previous single-epoch studies.

603,"We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential using 500 deg$^2$ of 150 GHz data from the SPTpol receiver on the South Pole Telescope. The lensing potential is reconstructed with signal-to-noise per mode greater than unity at lensing multipoles $L \lesssim 250$, using a quadratic estimator on a combination of CMB temperature and polarization maps. We report measurements of the lensing potential power spectrum in the multipole range of $100< L < 2000$ from sets of temperature-only, polarization-only, and minimum-variance estimators. We measure the lensing amplitude by taking the ratio of the measured spectrum to the expected spectrum from the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model to the $\textit{Planck}$ 2015 TT+lowP+lensing dataset. For the minimum-variance estimator, we find $A_{\rm{MV}} = 0.944 \pm 0.058{\rm (Stat.)}\pm0.025{\rm (Sys.)}$; restricting to only polarization data, we find $A_{\rm{POL}} = 0.906 \pm 0.090 {\rm (Stat.)} \pm 0.040 {\rm (Sys.)}$.

604,Direct detection experiments relying on nuclear recoil signatures lose sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter for typical galactic velocities. This sensitivity is recovered if there exists another source of flux with higher momenta. Such an energetic flux of light dark matter could originate from the decay of mesons produced in inelastic cosmic ray collisions. We compute this novel production mechanism---a cosmic beam dump experiment---and estimate the resulting limits from XENON1T and LZ. We find that the dark matter flux from inelastic cosmic rays colliding with atmospheric nuclei can dominate over the flux from elastic collisions with relic dark matter. The limits that we obtain for hadrophilic scalar mediator models are competitive with those from MiniBoone for light MeV-scale mediator masses.,"James Alvey, Miguel Campos, Malcolm Fairbairn, Tevong You","5 pages, 4 figures",1905.05776v1,No journal ref found,Tevong You,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05776v1,2019-05-14 18:01:20+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,Light Dark Matter from Inelastic Cosmic Ray Collisions,2019-05-14 18:01:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05776v1
605,"We present a formalism to extract the EoR HI power spectrum for drift scans using radio interferometers. Our main aim is to determine the coherence time scale of time-ordered visibilities. We compute the two-point correlation function of the HI visibilities measured at different times to address this question. We determine, for a given baseline, the decorrelation of the amplitude and the phase of this complex function. Our analysis uses primary beams of four ongoing and future interferometers---PAPER, MWA, HERA, and SKA1-LOW. We identify physical processes responsible for the decorrelation of the HI signal and isolate their impact by making suitable analytic approximations. For large beams (PAPER, MWA) and large baselines the decorrelation is dominated by the rotation of the sky intensity pattern and is proportional to the inverse of the primary beam. For smaller beams (HERA, SKA1-LOW), the translation of the intensity pattern also plays an important role. The decorrelation time of the amplitude of the correlation function lies in the range of 2--20~minutes for baselines of interest for the extraction of the HI signal. The phase angle of the correlation function can be made small after scaling out an appropriate phase term, which also causes the coherence time scale of the phase to be longer than the amplitude of the correlation function. We find that our results are insensitive to the input HI power spectrum and therefore they are directly applicable to the analysis of the drift scan data. We also apply our formalism to a set of point sources and statistically homogeneous diffuse correlated foregrounds. We find that point sources decorrelate on a time scale much shorter than the HI signal. This provides a novel mechanism to partially mitigate foregrounds on the plane of the sky in a drift scan.","Akash Kumar Patwa, Shiv Sethi","22 pages and 6 figures. Submitted for publication.

608,"Analyses of inflation models are usually conducted assuming a specific range---e.g., $N_k \simeq 50-60$--of the number $N_k$ of $e$-folds of inflation. However, the analysis can also be performed by taking into account constraints imposed by the physics of reheating. In this paper, we apply this analysis to a class of ""WIMPflation"" models in which the inflaton also plays the role of dark matter. Our analysis also updates prior WIMPflation work with more recent Planck 2018 data. With this new analysis, inflaton potentials $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^4$ and $\lambda \phi_0^4[1-\cos(\phi/\phi_0)]^2$ are ruled out, while $V(\phi)=\lambda \phi_0^4\{1-\exp[-(\phi/\phi_0)^2]\}^2$ is slightly disfavored, and $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi_0^4\tanh^4(\phi/\phi_0)$ is only viable for certain reheating conditions. In addition, we also discuss for the first time the effect of post-reheating entropy production (from, e.g., cosmological phase transitions) in this reheating-physics analysis. When accounted for, it decreases the number of $e$-folds through $\Delta N_k=-(1/3)\ln(1+\gamma)$, where $\gamma\equiv\delta s/s$ is the fractional increase in entropy. We discuss briefly the possible impact of entropy production to inflation-model constraints in earlier work.","Lingyuan Ji, Marc Kamionkowski","6 pages, 2 figures",1905.05770v1,No journal ref found,Marc Kamionkowski,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05770v1,2019-05-14 18:00:02+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,Reheating constraints to WIMPflation,2019-05-14 18:00:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05770v1

We present a periodic light curve classifier that combines a recurrent neural network autoencoder for unsupervised feature extraction and a dual-purpose estimation network for supervised classification and novelty detection. The estimation network optimizes a Gaussian mixture model in the reduced-dimension feature space, where each Gaussian component corresponds to a variable class. An estimation network with a basic structure of a single hidden layer attains a cross-validation classification accuracy of ~99%, on par with the conventional workhorses, random forest classifiers. With the addition of photometric features, the network is capable of detecting previously unseen types of variability with precision 0.90, recall 0.96, and an F1 score of 0.93. The simultaneous training of the autoencoder and estimation network is found to be mutually beneficial, resulting in faster autoencoder convergence, and superior classification and novelty detection performance. The estimation network also delivers adequate results even when optimized with pre-trained autoencoder features, suggesting that it can readily extend existing classifiers to provide added novelty detection capabilities.","Benny T. -H.

The modulus flips the Higgs mass term between stable and tachyonic values. We study a cosmological scenario in which such repeated phase transitions occur during inflation. An irrelevant operator coupling the Higgs field to the inflaton can then imprint the pattern of phase transitions in the correlation functions of the inflaton.

611,"The first dark matter halos form by direct collapse from peaks in the matter density field, and evidence from numerical simulations and other analyses suggests that the dense inner regions of these objects largely persist today. These halos would be the densest dark matter structures in the Universe, and their abundance can probe processes that leave imprints on the primordial density field, such as inflation or an early matter-dominated era. They can also probe dark matter through its free-streaming scale. The first halos are qualitatively different from halos that form by hierarchical clustering, as evidenced by their $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ inner density profiles. In this work, we present and tune models that predict the density profiles of these halos from properties of the density peaks from which they collapsed. These models predict the coefficient $A$ of the $\rho=Ar^{-3/2}$ small-radius asymptote of the density profile along with the maximum circular velocity $v_\mathrm{max}$ and associated radius $r_\mathrm{max}$. These models are universal: they can be applied to any cosmology, and we confirm this by validating the models using six $N$-body simulations carried out in wildly disparate cosmological scenarios.

612,"We present a model for viable gravitational reheating involving a scalar field directly coupled to the Ricci curvature scalar. Crucial to the model is a period of kination after inflation, which causes the Ricci scalar to change sign thus inducing a tachyonic effective mass $m^{2} \propto -H^2$ for the scalar field. The resulting tachyonic growth of the scalar field provides the energy for reheating, allowing for temperatures high enough for thermal leptogenesis. Additionally, the required period of kination necessarily leads to a blue-tilted primordial gravitational wave spectrum with the potential to be detected by future experiments. We find that for reheating temperatures $T_{\rm RH} \lesssim 1$ GeV, the possibility exists for the Higgs field to play the role of the scalar field.","Toby Opferkuch, Pedro Schwaller, Ben A.

613,"We present a new galaxy scaling relation that predicts the mass fractions of atomic gas, molecular gas and stars as a function of fundamental physical properties such as mass and specific angular momentum. Our scaling relation stretches across two orders of magnitude in mass fraction, and applies to galaxies of any morphological type from Sa to dIrr, thus spanning five orders of magnitude in stellar mass. It has a $1\sigma$ scatter of 0.2 dex, a correlation coefficient of 0.8 and a significance level close to 0, which means that the correlation between measured and predicted mass fractions is tight, strong and significant. The new scaling relation is not a best-fitting relation and has no free parameters, but originates from the low galaxy-to-galaxy variance of $\langle Q\rangle$, the mass-weighted average of Toomre's $Q$ stability parameter. This is in contrast to the variance/variation of $Q$ within a galaxy, which is particularly large for atomic gas.",Alessandro B.

614,"We perform a Very Large Telescope FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (VLT/FORS2) narrowband imaging search around 5 star-forming galaxies at redshift z=0.67-0.69 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field to constrain the radial extent of large-scale outflows traced by resonantly scattered MgII emission. The sample galaxies span star formation rates in the range 4 $M_{\odot}/yr$ < SFR < $40\ M_{\odot}/yr$ and have stellar masses $9.9 \lesssim \log M_{*}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 11.0$, and exhibit outflows traced by MgII absorption with velocities ~150-420 km s$^{-1}$ . These observations are uniquely sensitive, reaching surface brightness limits of 5.81 $\times$ $10^{-19}$ ergs sec $^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^2$ per 1 arcsec$^2$ aperture (at 5$\sigma$ significance). We do not detect any extended emission around any of the sample galaxies, thus placing 5$\sigma$ upper limits on the brightness of extended MgII emission of $<6.51 \times 10^{-19}$ ergs sec $^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^2$ at projected distances $R_{\perp} > 8-21$ kpc. The imaging also resolves the MgII absorption observed toward each galaxy spatially, revealing approximately constant absorption strengths across the galaxy disks. In concert with radiative transfer models predicting the surface brightness of MgII emission for a variety of simple wind morphologies, our detection limits suggest that either (1) the extent of the MgII-emitting material in the outflows from these galaxies is limited to $\lesssim 20$ kpc; or (2) the outflows are anisotropic and/or dusty.","Ryan Rickards Vaught, Kate H.

615,"The existing predictions of the energy density of gravitational waves produced during preheating mostly rely on computer simulations in which the matter field inhomogeneities essentially behave classically. In this article we follow instead a full quantum treatment of the process within the in-in formalism. We use this approach to determine the expected density of the produced gravitational waves and numerically estimate its value in a simple scalar field model, neglecting backreaction. Particular attention is devoted to the regularization and renormalization of the divergences that appear in the in-in formalism. We also address how our approach compares with the conventional calculations used in the literature, and what elements could be missed in the conventional analyses of gravitational wave production that rely on numerical simulations. In the cases in which parametric resonance is effective, our results agree with the predictions expected from numerical simulations, as anticipated.

Using the MPI-AMRVAC code, we perform three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations, considering the loop as a magnetic flux tube filled in with denser, hotter, and gravitationally stratified plasma. We show the resonant response of the loop to its external excitation and analyse the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at different heights. We also study the spatial distribution of plasma heating due to transverse oscillations along the loop. The positions of the maximum heating are in total agreement with those for the intensity of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and correspond to the standing wave anti-nodes in the resonant cases. The initial temperature configuration and plasma mixing effect appear to play a significant role in plasma heating by transverse footpoint motions. In particular, the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a hotter loop results in the enhancement of the mean plasma temperature in the domain.","Andrey Afanasyev, Konstantinos Karampelas, Tom Van Doorsselaere",Published in ApJ,1905.05716v1,No journal ref found,Tom Van Doorsselaere,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05716v1,2019-05-14 16:45:42+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Coronal loop transverse oscillations excited by different driver   frequencies,2019-05-14 16:45:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05716v1
617,"More than half a million of the 1.69 billion sources in Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) are published with photometric time series that exhibit light variations during the 22 months of observation. An all-sky classification of common high-amplitude pulsators (Cepheids, long-period variables, Delta Scuti / SX Phoenicis, and RR Lyrae stars) is provided for stars with brightness variations greater than 0.1 mag in G band. A semi-supervised classification approach was employed, firstly training multi-stage random forest classifiers with sources of known types in the literature, followed by a preliminary classification of the Gaia data and a second training phase that included a selection of the first classification results to improve the representation of some classes, before the improved classifiers were applied to the Gaia data. Dedicated validation classifiers were used to reduce the level of contamination in the published results. A relevant fraction of objects were not yet sufficiently sampled for reliable Fourier series decomposition, consequently classifiers were based on features derived from statistics of photometric time series in the G, BP, and RP bands, as well as from some astrometric parameters. The published classification results include 195,780 RR Lyrae stars, 150,757 long-period variables, 8550 Cepheids, and 8882 Delta Scuti / SX Phoenicis stars. All of these results represent candidates whose completeness and contamination are described as a function of variability type and classification reliability.

618,"We analyse the Planck full-mission cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and E-mode polarization maps to obtain constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). We compare estimates obtained from separable template-fitting, binned, and modal bispectrum estimators, finding consistent values for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes. Our combined temperature and polarization analysis produces the following results: f_NL^local = -0.9 +\- 5.1; f_NL^equil = -26 +\- 47; and f_NL^ortho = - 38 +\- 24 (68%CL, statistical). These results include the low-multipole (4 <= l < 40) polarization data, not included in our previous analysis, pass an extensive battery of tests, and are stable with respect to our 2015 measurements. Polarization bispectra display a significant improvement in robustness; they can now be used independently to set NG constraints. We consider a large number of additional cases, e.g. scale-dependent feature and resonance bispectra, isocurvature primordial NG, and parity-breaking models, where we also place tight constraints but do not detect any signal. The non-primordial lensing bispectrum is detected with an improved significance compared to 2015, excluding the null hypothesis at 3.5 sigma. We present model-independent reconstructions and analyses of the CMB bispectrum. Our final constraint on the local trispectrum shape is g_NLl^local = (-5.8 +\-6.5) x 10^4 (68%CL, statistical), while constraints for other trispectra are also determined. We constrain the parameter space of different early-Universe scenarios, including general single-field models of inflation, multi-field and axion field parity-breaking models. Our results provide a high-precision test for structure-formation scenarios, in complete agreement with the basic picture of the LambdaCDM cosmology regarding the statistics of the initial conditions (abridged).","Planck Collaboration, Y.

We confirm MACS 0717 as the cluster with the most complex structure, and having the largest lensing efficiency and Einstein radius. When comparing these results with the ones obtained by previous observations of these clusters, we obtain an increase in the lensing efficiency between 1.4 and 2.3. We also find a good correlation with a relatively small dispersion between the lensing efficiency and Einstein radius as a function of the source redshift ($z_s$).

620,"Observations of mixed modes in evolved low-mass stars enable us to probe the properties of not only the outer envelope of these stars, but also their deep layers. Among the seismic parameters associated with mixed modes, the gravity offset, denoted with $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$, is expected to reveal information on the boundaries of the inner buoyancy resonant cavity. This parameter was recently measured for hundreds of stars observed by the Kepler satellite and its value was shown to change during the evolution on the red giant branch. In this article, we theoretically investigate the reasons for such a variation in terms of structure properties. Using available asymptotic analyses and a simple model of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a and Lamb frequencies, we derived an analytical expression of $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ for dipolar modes and compared its predictions to observations. First, we show that the asymptotic value of $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ well agrees with the mean value observed at the beginning of the ascent of the red giant branch, which results from the high density contrast between the helium core and the base of the convective envelope. Second, we demonstrate that the predicted value also explains the sharp decrease in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ observed for the more luminous red giant stars of the sample. This rapid drop turns out to occur just before the luminosity bump and result from the kink of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency near the upper turning point associated with the buoyancy cavity as stars evolve and this latter becomes close to the base of the convective envelope.The observed variation in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ and its link with the internal properties on the red giant branch are now globally understood. This motivates further analyses of the potential of this parameter as a seismic diagnosis of the region located between the helium core and the convective envelope.","C. PinÃ§on, M. Takata, B.

622,"The origin of dust in galaxy halos or in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is still a mystery. We investigate if the radiation pressure in high-redshift ($z\sim 10$) galaxies can efficiently transport dust to halos. To clarify the first dust enrichment of galaxy halos in the early Universe, we solve the motion of a dust grain considering radiation pressure, gas drag, and gravity in the vertical direction of the galactic disc. Radiation pressure is estimated in a consistent manner with the stellar spectra and dust extinction. As a consequence, we find that dust grains with radii $a\sim 0.1~\mu$m successfully escape from the galactic disc if the ongoing star formation episode converts more than 15 per cent of the baryon content into stars and lasts $\gtrsim 30$ Myr, while larger and smaller grains are trapped in the disc because of gravity and gas drag, respectively. We also show that grain charge significantly enhances gas drag at a few--10 scale heights of the galactic disc, where the grain velocities are suppressed to $\sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$. There is an optimum dust-to-gas ratio ($\sim 10^{-3}$) in the galactic disc and an optimum virial mass $\sim 10^{10}$--$10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the transport of $a\sim 0.1~\mu$m grains to the halo.

Previous work showed that thawing models with $X \approx 0$ evolve along a set of unique trajectories for $w(a)$, while those with $F_X \approx 0$ can result in a variety of different forms for $w(a)$. We show that if $dV/d\phi$ is small and $(1/V)(dV/d\phi)$ is roughly constant, then the latter models also converge toward a single unique set of behaviors for $w(a)$, different from those with $X \approx 0$. We derive the functional form for $w(a)$ in this case, determine the conditions on $V(\phi)$ for which it applies, and present observational constraints on this new class of models.","John Kehayias, Robert J.

624,"The X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28 is a unique source which shows both pulsations and type-II X-ray bursts, allowing studies of the interaction of the accretion disk with the magnetosphere at huge mass accretion rates exceeding $10^{19}$ g s$^{-1}$ during its super-Eddington outbursts. The magnetic field strength in the source, $B\approx 5\times 10^{11}$ G, is known from the cyclotron absorption feature discovered in the energy spectrum around 4.5 keV. Here, we explore the flux variability of the source in context of interaction of its magnetosphere with the radiation-pressure dominated accretion disk. Particularly, we present the results of the analysis of noise power density spectra (PDS) using the observations of the source in 1996-1997 by RXTE. Accreting compact objects commonly exhibit a broken power-law shape of the PDS with a break corresponding to the Keplerian orbital frequency of matter at the innermost disk radius. The observed frequency of the break can thus be used to estimate the size of the magnetosphere. We found, however, that the observed PDS of GRO J1744-28 differs dramatically from the canonical shape. Furthermore, the observed break frequency appears to be significantly higher than what is expected based on the magnetic field estimated from the cyclotron line energy. We argue that these observational facts can be attributed to the existence of the radiation-pressure dominated region in the accretion disk at luminosities above $\sim$2$\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We discuss a qualitative model for the PDS formation in such disks, and show that its predictions are consistent with our observational findings. The presence of the radiation-pressure dominated region can also explain the observed weak luminosity-dependence of the inner radius, and we argue that the small inner radius can be explained by a quadrupole component dominating the magnetic field of the neutron star.","Juhani MÃ¶nkkÃ¶nen, Sergey S.

625,"The complexity of physico-chemical models of star formation is increasing, with models that take into account new processes and more realistic setups. These models allow astrochemists to compute the evolution of chemical species throughout star formation. Hence, comparing the outputs of such models to observations allows to bring new constraints on star formation. The work presented in this paper is based on the recent public release of a database of radiation hydrodynamical low-mass star formation models. We used this database as physical parameters to compute the time dependent chemical composition of collapsing cores with a 3-phase gas-grain model. The results are analyzed to find chemical tracers of the initial physical parameters of collapse such as the mass, radius, temperature, density, and free-fall time. They are also compared to observed molecular abundances of Class 0 protostars. We find numerous tracers of the initial parameters of collapse, except for the initial mass. More particularly, we find that gas phase CH3CN, NS and OCS trace the initial temperature, while H2CS trace the initial density and free-fall time of the parent cloud. The comparison of our results with a sample of 12 Class 0 low mass protostars allows us to constrain the initial parameters of collapse of low-mass prestellar cores.

626,"We demonstrate that for data recorded with a solar telescope that uses adaptive optics and/or post-processing to compensate for many low- and high-order aberrations, the RMS granulation contrast is directly proportional to the Strehl ratio calculated from the residual (small-scale) wavefront error. We demonstrate that the wings of the high-order compensated PSF for SST are likely to extend to a radius of not more than about 2 arcsec, consistent with earlier conclusions drawn from straylight compensation of sunspot images. We report on simultaneous measurements of seeing and solar granulation contrast averaged over 2 sec time intervals at several wavelengths from 525 nm to 853.6 nm on the red-beam (CRISP beam) and wavelengths from 395 nm to 484 nm on the blue-beam (CHROMIS beam). These data were recorded with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) that has been revamped with an 85-electrode adaptive mirror and a new tip-tilt mirror, both of which were polished to exceptionally high optical quality. The highest 2-sec average image contrast measured in April 2015 through 0.3-0.9 nm interference filters at 525 nm, 557 nm, 630 nm and 853.5 nm with compensation only for the diffraction limited point spread function of SST is 11.8%, 11.8%, 10.2% and 7.2% respectively. Similarly, the highest 2-sec contrast measured at 395 nm, 400 nm and 484 nm in May 2016 through 0.37-1.3 nm filters is 16%, 16% and 12.5% respectively. The granulation contrast observed with SST compares favorably with that of other telescopes. Simultaneously with the above wideband red-beam data, we also recorded narrow-band continuum images with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter. We find that contrasts measured with CRISP are entirely consistent with the corresponding wide-band contrasts, demonstrating that any additional image degradation by the CRISP etalons and telecentric optical system is marginal or even insignificant.","Goran Scharmer, Mats Lofdahl, Guus Sliepen, Jaime de la Cruz Rodriguez",In press in Astronomy & Astrophysics,1905.05588v1,No journal ref found,Jaime de la Cruz Rodriguez,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05588v1,2019-05-14 13:29:18+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.SR,Is the sky the limit?

These measurements were carried out using high spectral resolution observations obtained with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher in polarimetric mode, installed at the ESO La Silla 3.6 m telescope. In agreement with previous studies of Herbig Ae stars, the longitudinal magnetic field in the primary is rather weak, ranging from 47 G to 72 G. The secondary component possesses a variable, much stronger magnetic field, up to 600 G, as expected for a magnetically active T Tauri star.

628,"Studying the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) in stellar environments, that leads to the creation of elements heavier than 56-Fe, remains one of the fundamental questions of modern physics and therefore an active field of research within nuclear astrophysics. Exotic nuclides which participate in the r-process due to their low production yield and short half-life can be efficiently investigated in storage rings. In such facilities non-destructive methods of particle detection are often used for in-flight measurements based on frequency analysis. Due to the low signal level the detectors should be very sensitive and fast because of short lifetime of the particles. Resonant Schottky cavity pickups fulfill such requirement. Apart from their applications in the measurements of beam parameters, they can be used in non-destructive in-ring decay studies of radioactive ion beams. In addition, position sensitive Schottky pick-up cavities can enhance precision in the isochronous mass measurement technique. The goal of this work is to design such a position sensitive resonant Schottky cavity pickup based on theoretical calculations and simulations.","D. Dmytriiev, M. S. Sanjari, Yu. A. Litvinov, Th.

629,"Hidden photons are dark matter candidates motivated by theories beyond the standard model of particle physics. They mix with conventional photons, and they can be detected through the very weak electromagnetic radiation they induce at the interface between a metal and the air. SHUKET (SearcH for U(1) darK matter with an Electromagnetic Telescope) is a dedicated experiment sensitive to the hidden photon-induced signal. The results from a hidden photon search campaign are reported, with no significant detection of a dark matter signal. Exclusion limits are derived from the observed noise fluctuations in a 5 GHz to 6.8 GHz frequency range, corresponding to a hidden photon mass region ranging from 20.8 micro-eV to 28.3 micro-eV. SHUKET is currently the most sensitive instrument in this mass range and the obtained limits on the kinetic mixing term constrain significantly dark matter models inspired from string theory.","Pierre Brun, Laurent Chevalier, Christophe Flouzat","To appear in Physical Review Letters; 5 pages, 5 figures",1905.05579v1,No journal ref found,Christophe Flouzat,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05579v1,2019-05-14 13:13:20+00:00,hep-ex,hep-ex|astro-ph.CO,Direct Searches for Hidden-Photon Dark Matter with the SHUKET Experiment,2019-05-14 13:13:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05579v1

631,"In order to identify the sources of the observed diffuse high-energy neutrino flux, it is crucial to discover their electromagnetic counterparts. IceCube began releasing alerts for single high-energy ($E > 60$ TeV) neutrino detections with sky localisation regions of order 1 deg radius in 2016. We used Pan-STARRS1 to follow-up five of these alerts during 2016-2017 to search for any optical transients that may be related to the neutrinos. Typically 10-20 faint ($m < 22.5$ mag) extragalactic transients are found within the Pan-STARRS1 footprints and are generally consistent with being unrelated field supernovae (SNe) and AGN. We looked for unusual properties of the detected transients, such as temporal coincidence of explosion epoch with the IceCube timestamp. We found only one transient that had properties worthy of a specific follow-up. In the Pan-STARRS1 imaging for IceCube-160427A (probability to be of astrophysical origin of $\sim$50 %), we found a SN PS16cgx, located at 10.0' from the nominal IceCube direction. Spectroscopic observations of PS16cgx showed that it was an H-poor SN at z = 0.2895. The spectra and light curve resemble some high-energy Type Ic SNe, raising the possibility of a jet driven SN with an explosion epoch temporally coincident with the neutrino detection. However, distinguishing Type Ia and Type Ic SNe at this redshift is notoriously difficult. Based on all available data we conclude that the transient is more likely to be a Type Ia with relatively weak SiII absorption and a fairly normal rest-frame r-band light curve. If, as predicted, there is no high-energy neutrino emission from Type Ia SNe, then PS16cgx must be a random coincidence, and unrelated to the IceCube-160427A. We find no other plausible optical transient for any of the five IceCube events observed down to a 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $m \sim 22$ mag, between 1 day and 25 days after detection.","E.

632,"Using a thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal, we search for hot gas in superclusters identified using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS/DR7) galaxies. We stack a Comptonization y map produced by the Planck Collaboration around the superclusters and detect the tSZ signal at a significance of 6.4 sigma. We further search for an intercluster component of gas in the superclusters. For this, we remove the intracluster gas in the superclusters by masking all galaxy groups/clusters detected by the Planck tSZ, ROSAT X-ray, and SDSS optical surveys down to a total mass of 10^13 Msun. We report the first detection of intercluster gas in superclusters with y = (3.5 +- 1.4) * 10^(-8) at a significance of 2.5 sigma. Assuming a simple isothermal and flat density distribution of intercluster gas over superclusters, the estimated baryon density is (Omega_gas / Omega_b) * (T_e/(8*10^6 K)) = 0.067 +- 0.006 +- 0.025. This quantity is inversely proportional to the temperature, therefore taking values from simulations and observations, we find that the gas density in superclusters may account for 17 - 52 % of missing baryons at low redshifts. A better understanding of the physical state of gas in the superclusters is required to accurately estimate the contribution of our measurements to missing baryons.","H. Tanimura, N. Aghanim, M.

633,"We study the effect of dynamical friction on globular clusters and on the stars evaporated from the globular clusters (stellar streams) moving in a galactic halo. Due to dynamical friction, the position of a globular cluster (GC) as a stream progenitor starts to shift with respect to its original position in the reference frame of initial GC orbit. Therefore the stars that have evaporated at different times have different mean position with respect to the GC position. This shifting results in a certain asymmetry in stellar density distribution between the leading and trailing arms of the stream. The degree of the asymmetry depends on the characteristics of the environment in which the GC and the stream stars move. As GCs are located mainly in outer parts of a galaxy, this makes dynamical friction a unique probe to constrain the underlying dark matter spatial density and velocity distributions. For a GC NGC 3201 we compared our theoretical shift estimates with available observations. Due to large uncertainties in current observation data, we can only conclude that the derived estimates have the same order of magnitude.","Rain Kipper, Peeter Tenjes, Gert HÃ¼tsi, Taavi Tuvikene, Elmo Tempel","11 pages, 5 figures, accepted to MNRAS",1905.05553v1,No journal ref found,Elmo Tempel,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05553v1,2019-05-14 12:34:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,The influence of dark matter halo on the stellar stream asymmetry via   dynamical friction,2019-05-14 12:34:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05553v1

636,"We reconstruct in this paper the deceleration and jerk parameters as functions of the cosmological redshift from data on cosmic chronometers (CCH), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and the Pantheon+MCT compilation of supernovae of Type Ia (SnIa). The reconstruction is carried out with the Weighted Function Regression method, previously introduced by G\'omez-Valent & Amendola (2018). It improves the usual cosmographic approach by automatically implementing Occam's razor criterion. This makes our procedure to be more free of model and parametrization dependencies than many other analyses in the literature. The reconstructed functions are fully compatible with the predictions for the concordance model. In addition, we also discuss the confidence level at which we can claim that the Universe (assumed to be flat, homogeneous and isotropic) is currently accelerating. According to Jeffreys' scale and jargon, we find moderate evidence in favor of such speed-up using the data on SnIa+CCH, and very strong one when we also use data on BAOs. The measured current value of the deceleration parameter in the latter case reads $q_0\sim -0.60\pm 0.10$, and for the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift we find $z_t\sim 0.8\pm 0.10$. The former is $\sim 6\sigma$ away from $0$. This is in stark contrast, for instance, with the $\sim 17\sigma$ that are found in the context of the flat $\Lambda$CDM even without including the BAOs data. This indicates that cosmography and Occam's razor criterion play a crucial role in this discussion, and that estimating the evidence for positive acceleration only in the framework of a particular cosmological model or parametrization is clearly insufficient.",AdriÃ  GÃ³mez-Valent,"41 pages, 6 Tables and 8 Figures.

637,"Dwarf novae (DNe) and X-ray binaries exhibit outbursts thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disk. The disk instability model (DIM) assumes that accretion is driven by turbulent transport, customarily attributed to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Recent results point out that MRI turbulence alone fails to reproduce the light curves of DNe. We aim to study the impact of wind-driven accretion on the light curves of DNe. Local and global simulations show that magneto-hydrodynamic winds are present when a magnetic field threads the disk, even for relatively high ratios of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure ($\beta \approx 10^{5}$). These winds are very efficient in removing angular momentum but do not heat the disk; they do not behave as MRI-driven turbulence. We add wind-driven transport in the angular momentum equation of the DIM, assuming a fixed magnetic configuration: dipolar or constant with radius. We use prescriptions for the wind torque and the turbulent torque derived from shearing box simulations. The wind torque enhances the accretion of matter, resulting in light curves that look like DNe outbursts when assuming a dipolar field with a moment $\mu\approx10^{30}\,\mathrm{G\,cm^{3}}$. In the region where the wind dominates, the disk is cold, optically thin and the accretion speed is sonic. This acts as if the inner disk was truncated, leading to higher quiescent X-ray luminosities from the white dwarf boundary layer than expected with the standard DIM. The disk is stabilized if the wind-dominated region is large enough, potentially leading to `dark' disks emitting little radiation.

The new observations occurred at a time when the source flux was three times lower, and the background was three times higher, than in the earlier observations. The analysis described in this research note show that the new observations are consistent with the old one at the wavelengths of the OVIII WHIM line, and the lower signal-to-noise of the new data did not permit a significant detection of the line in the new data.","Massimiliano Bonamente, Jussi Ahoranta, Jukka Nevalainen, Patrick Holt","2 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in the Research Notes of

639,"Rings in S0s are enigmatic features which can however betray the evolutionary paths of particular galaxies. We have undertaken long-slit spectroscopy of five lenticular galaxies with UV-bright outer rings. The observations have been made with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) to reveal the kinematics, chemistry, and the ages of the stellar populations and the gas characteristics in the rings and surrounding disks. Four of the five rings are also bright in the H-alpha emission line, and the spectra of the gaseous rings extracted around the maxima of the H-alpha equivalent width reveal excitation by young stars betraying current star formation in the rings. The integrated level of this star formation is 0.1-0.2 solar mass per year, with the outstanding value of 1 solar mass per year in NGC 7808. The difference of chemical composition between the ionized gas of the rings which demonstrate nearly solar metallicity and the underlying stellar disks which are metal-poor implies recent accretion of the gas and star formation ignition; the star formation history estimated by using different star formation indicators implies that the star formation rate decreases with e-folding time of less than 1 Gyr. In NGC 809 where the UV-ring is well visible but the H-alpha emission line excited by massive stars is absent, the star formation has already ceased.","Irina S. Proshina, Alexei Yu. Kniazev, Olga K.

640,"We describe a new tool developed for solar flare forecasting on the base of some sunspot group properties. Assuming that the flare frequency follows the Poisson statistics, this tool uses a database containing the morphological characteristics of the suspot groups daily observed by the Equatorial Spar of INAF $-$ Catania Astrophysical Observatory since January 2002 up today. By means of a linear combination of the flare rates computed on the base of some properties of the sunspot groups, like area, number of pores and sunspots, Zurich class, relative importance between leading spot and density of the sunspot population, and type of penumbra of the main sunspot, we determine the probability percentages that a flare of a particular energy range may occur. Comparing our forecasts with the flares registered by GOES satellites in the 1$-$8 \AA{} X$-$ray band during the subsequent 24 hrs we measured the performance of our method. We found that this method, which combines some morphological parameters and a statistical technique, has the best performances for the strongest events, which are more interesting for their implications in the Earth environment.","M.

641,"We consider a binary system composed of a pulsar and a massive, fast rotating, highly distorted main sequence star as a potential scenario to dynamically put to the test certain post-Keplerian effects of both Newtonian and post-Newtonian nature. We numerically produce time series of the perturbations $\Delta\left(\delta\tau\right)$ of the R{\o}mer-like, orbital component of the pulsar's time delay $\delta\tau$ induced over 10 years by the pN gravitoelectric mass monopole, quadrupole, gravitomagnetic spin dipole and octupole accelerations along with the Newtonian quadrupolar one. We do not deal with the various propagation time delays due to the travelling electromagnetic waves. It turns out that, for a Be-type star with $M = 15\ \textrm{M}_\odot$, $R_\textrm{e} = 5.96\ \textrm{R}_\odot$, $\nu = 0.203$, $S = 3.41\times 10^{45}\ \textrm{J}\ \textrm{s}$, $J_2 = 1.92\times 10^{-3}$ orbited by a pulsar with an orbital period $P_\textrm{b}\simeq 40-70\ \textrm{d}$, the classical oblateness-driven effects are at the $\lesssim 4-150\ \textrm{s}$ level, while the pN shifts are of the order of $\lesssim 1.5-20\ \textrm{s}\ \left(GMc^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim 10-40\ \textrm{ms}\ \left(GMR^2_\textrm{e} J_2 c^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim 0.5 - 6\ \textrm{ms}\ \left(GSc^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim 5 - 20\ \mu\textrm{s}\ \left(GSR^2_\textrm{e} \varepsilon^2 c^{-2}\right)$, depending on their orbital configuration.

644,"We compiled a sample of 73 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with reverberation mapping (RM) observations from RM campaigns including our ongoing campaign of monitoring super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). This sample covers a large range of black hole (BH) mass $(M_{\bullet}=10^{6-9}~M_\odot)$, dimensionless accretion rates $(\dot{\mathscr{M}}=10^{-2.7}-10^{2.7})$ and 5100~\AA~luminosity $(L_{5100}=10^{42-46}~\rm erg~s^{-1})$, allowing us to systematically study the AGN variability and their relations with BH mass, accretion rates, and optical luminosity. We employed the damped random walk (DRW) model to delineate the optical variability of continuum at 5100~\AA~and obtained damped variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm d}$) and amplitude ($\sigma_{\rm d}$) using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We also estimated the traditional variability amplitudes ($F_{\rm var}$), which provide a model-independent measure and therefore are used to test the DRW results. We found that AGN variability characteristics are generally correlated with $(M_{\bullet},\dot{\mathscr{M}},L_{5100})$. These correlations are smooth from sub-Eddington to super-Eddington accretion AGNs, probably implying that the AGN variability may be caused by the same physical mechanism.","Kai-Xing Lu, Ying-Ke Huang, Zhi-Xiang Zhang, Kai Wang, Pu Du, Chen Hu, Ming Xiao, Yan-Rong Li, Jin-Ming Bai, Wei-Hao Bian, Ye-Fei Yuan, Luis C.

646,"High Mach number shocks are ubiquitous in interstellar turbulence. The Pencil Code is particularly well suited to the study of magnetohydrodynamics in weakly compressible turbulence and the numerical investigation of dynamos because of its high-order advection and time evolution algorithms. However, the high-order algorithms and lack of Riemann solver to follow shocks make it less well suited to handling high Mach number shocks, such as those produced by supernovae (SNe). Here, we outline methods required to enable the code to efficiently and accurately model SNe, using parameters that allow stable simulation of SN-driven turbulence, in order to construct a physically realistic galactic dynamo model. These include the resolution of shocks with artificial viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion; the correction of the mass diffusion terms; and generalization of the Courant condition to include all source terms in the momentum and energy equations. We test our methods with the numerical solution of the 1D Riemann shock tube (Sod 1978), also extended to a 1D adiabatic shock with parameters and Mach number relevant to SN shock evolution, including shocks with radiative losses. We extend our test with the 3D numerical simulation of individual SN remnant evolution for a range of ambient gas densities typical of the interstellar medium and relate these to the analytical solutions of Sedov-Taylor (adiabatic) and the snowplough and Cioffi et al. (1988) results incorporating cooling and heating processes.","Frederick A. Gent, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, Maarit J. KÃ¤pylÃ¤, Graeme R. Sarson, James F.

647,"The gravitational waveform of a merging stellar-mass binary is described at leading order by a quadrupolar mode. However, the complete waveform includes higher-order modes, which encode valuable information not accessible from the leading-order mode alone. Despite this, the majority of astrophysical inferences so far obtained with observations of gravitational waves employ only the leading order mode because calculations with higher-order modes are often computationally challenging. We show how to efficiently incorporate higher-order modes into astrophysical inference calculations with a two step procedure. First, we carry out Bayesian parameter estimation using a computationally cheap leading-order-mode waveform, which provides an initial estimate of binary parameters. Second, we weight the initial estimate using higher-order mode waveforms in order to fold in the extra information from the full waveform. We use mock data to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. We apply the method to each binary black hole event in the first gravitational-wave transient catalog GWTC-1 to obtain posterior distributions and Bayesian evidence with higher-order modes. Performing Bayesian model selection on the events in GWTC-1, we find only a weak preference for waveforms with higher order modes. We discuss how this method can be generalized to a variety of other applications.","Ethan Payne, Colm Talbot, Eric Thrane","11 pages, 11 figures",1905.05477v1,No journal ref found,Eric Thrane,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05477v1,2019-05-14 09:21:14+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.HE|gr-qc,Higher order gravitational-wave modes with likelihood reweighting,2019-05-14 09:21:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05477v1
648,"We consider that electromagnetic pulses produced in the jets of this innermost part of the accretion disk accelerate charged particles (protons, ions, electrons) to very high energies including energies above $10^{20}$ eV for the case of protons and nucleus and $10^{12-15}$ eV for electrons by electromagnetic wave-particle interaction. The episodic eruptive accretion in the disk by the magneto-rotational instability gives rise to the strong Alfvenic pulses, which acts as the driver of the collective accelerating pondermotive force. This pondermotive force drives the wakes. The accelerated hadrons (protons and nuclei) are released to the intergalactic space to be ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The high-energy electrons, on the other hand, emit photons in the collisions of electromagnetic perturbances to produce various non-thermal emissions (radio, IR, visible, UV, and gamma-rays) of active galactic nuclei. Applying the theory to M82 X-1, we find that it can explain the northern hot spot of ultra high energy cosmic rays above $6\times 10^{19}$ eV.

Hourly aerosol attenuation loads (Vertical Aerosol Optical Depth) are used to correct the measured profiles. Two techniques are used to determine the aerosol profiles, which have been proven to be fully compatible.

653,"The narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy PMN J0948+0022 is an archetype of gamma-ray-emitting NLS1s in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this study, we investigate its radio structures using archival data obtained using the Karl G.~Jansky very large array (VLA) and the very long baseline array (VLBA). The new VLA images reveal an outermost radio emission separated by 9.1 arcsec. Its resolved structure and steep spectrum suggest a terminal shock in a radio lobe energized by the jet from the PMN J0948+0022 nucleus. This large-scale radio component is found at almost the same position angle as that of the pc-scale jet, indicating a stable jet direction up to ~1 Mpc. Its apparent one-sidedness implies a moderate advancing speed ($\beta>0.27$). The kinematic age of 1 x 10^7 year of the jet activity is consistent with the expected NLS1 phase of ~10^7 year in the AGN lifetime. The VLBA image reveals the jet structure at distances ranging from r=0.82 milliarcsec to 3.5 milliarcsec, corresponding to approximately 100 pc, where superluminal motions were found. The jet width profile ($\propto r^{1.12}$) and flux-density profile ($\propto r^{-1.44}$) depending on the distance $r$ along the jet suggest that the jet kinetic energy is converted into internal energy in this region.

654,"Protoplanets can produce structures in protoplanetary disks via gravitational disk-planet interactions. Once detected, such structures serve as signposts of planet formation. Here we investigate the kinematic signatures in disks produced by multi-Jupiter mass ($M_{\rm J}$) planets using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations. Such a planet opens a deep gap, and drives transonic vertical motions inside. Such motions include both a bulk motion of the entire half-disk column, and turbulence on scales comparable to and smaller than the scale height. They significantly broaden molecular lines from the gap, producing double-peaked line profiles at certain locations, and a kinematic velocity dispersion comparable to thermal after azimuthal averaging. The same planet does not drive fast vertical motions outside the gap, except at the inner spiral arms and the disk surface. Searching for line broadening induced by multi-$M_{\rm J}$ planets inside gaps requires an angular resolution comparable to the gap width, an assessment of the gap gas temperature to within a factor of 2, and a high sensitivity needed to detect line emission from the gap.","Ruobing Dong, Sheng-yuan Liu, Jeffrey Fung","20 pages, 11 figures, 1 appendix, ApJ accepted",1811.09629v3,No journal ref found,Jeffrey Fung,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09629v3,2018-11-23 19:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Observational Signatures of Planets in Protoplanetary Disks:   Planet-Induced Line Broadening in Gaps,2019-05-14 06:43:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09629v3
655,"We investigate the absorption features associated with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy using cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Our goal is to explore whether the progenitors of the lowest mass dwarf galaxies known to harbor neutral hydrogen today (M_star~10^6 solar mass, M_halo=4x10^9 solar mass) could possibly be detected as Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs) over cosmic time. We trace the evolution of a single dwarf galaxy, pre-selected to contain DLAs, from the era of the first metal-free, so-called Population~III (Pop~III), stars, down to z=0, thus allowing us to study the metal enrichment history of DLAs associated with the simulated galaxy. We find that the progenitors of the simulated dwarf are expected to be seen for most of their evolution as DLAs that are contaminated by normal, Population~II, stars. The time period during which DLAs are only metal-enriched by Pop~III stars, on the other hand, is likely very brief, confined to high redshifts, z~6. The susceptibility of the dwarfs to the external UV radiation background allows them to preserve neutral gas only at the centre (a few ~100 pc). This results in a small probability that the simulated dwarf would be observed as a DLA. This study suggests that DLAs are unlikely to be hosted in the lowest mass dwarfs that can harbor neutral gas (M_halo~ 4x10^9 solar mass), below which neutral gas is unlikely to exist. However, this study does illustrate that, when detected, absorption lines provide a powerful method for probing ISM conditions inside the smallest dwarf galaxies at intermediate to high redshifts.","Myoungwon Jeon, Gurtina Besla, Volker Bromm","13 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for Publication in ApJ",1905.05409v1,No journal ref found,Volker Bromm,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05409v1,2019-05-14 06:36:30+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Probing the assembly of dwarf galaxies through cosmic time with damped   Lyman-$Î±$ absorption spectroscopy,2019-05-14 06:36:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05409v1
656,"We explore the issue of prior dependence in the context of one-sided constraints on the dark matter-photon and dark matter-neutrino elastic scattering cross-sections derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies measurements. Testing in particular the linear flat, Jeffreys, and logarithmic flat priors, we find that the former two yield upper limits on the cross-sections that are mutually consistent to within 20%. In contrast, bounds derived under the assumption of the logarithmic flat prior are strongly sensitive to the choice of the lower prior boundary. Indeed, surveying the recent literature, we find that this pathology of the logarithmic prior has resulted in published constraints that are up to an order of magnitude artificially tighter than they should objectively be. Our revised `objective' constraints from the 2015 data of the Planck CMB mission on the present-day scattering cross-sections are $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma} < 1.72 \times 10^{-6} \, \sigma_{\rm T} \, (m_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$ and $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma} < 2.74 \times 10^{-15} \, \sigma_{\rm T} \, (m_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$ for dark matter-photon interactions scaling as $a^0$ and $a^{-2}$ respectively, where $a$ is the scale factor, and $\sigma_{\rm T}$ the total Thomson scattering cross-section. Their dark matter-neutrino counterparts read $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu} < 2.14 \times 10^{-6} \, \sigma_{\rm T} \, (m_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$ and $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}< 2.46 \times 10^{-15} \, \sigma_{\rm T} \, (m_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$.

657,"In the present work, we explore the Rossby mode instabilities in neutron stars as sources of gravitational waves. The intensity and time evolution of the emitted gravitational waves in terms of the amplitude of the strain tensor are estimated in the slow rotation approximation using $\beta$-equilibrated neutron star matter obtained from density dependent M3Y effective interaction. For a wide range of neutron star masses, the fiducial gravitational and various viscous time scales, the critical frequencies and the time evolutions of the frequencies are calculated. The dissipative mechanism of the Rossby modes is considered to be driven by the shear viscosity along the boundary layer of the solid crust-liquid core interface as well as in the core and the bulk viscosity. It is found that neutron stars with slower frequency of rotation, for the same mass, radius and surface temperature, are expected to emit gravitational waves of higher intensity.","Sujan Roy, Somnath Mukhopadhyay, Joydev Lahiri, Debasis Atta, Partha Roy Chowdhury, D.

658,"The tidal deformability of a self-gravitating object leaves an imprint on the gravitational-wave signal of an inspiral which is paramount to measure the internal structure of the binary components. We unveil here a surprisingly unnoticed effect: in the extreme-mass ratio limit the tidal Love number of the central object (i.e. the quadrupole moment induced by the tidal field of its companion) affects the gravitational waveform at the leading order in the mass ratio. This effect acts as a magnifying glass for the tidal deformability of supermassive objects but was so far neglected, probably because the tidal Love numbers of a black hole (the most natural candidate for a compact supermassive object) are identically zero. We argue that extreme-mass ratio inspirals detectable by the future LISA mission might place constraints on the tidal Love numbers of the central object which are roughly 8 orders of magnitude more stringent than current ones on neutron stars, potentially probing all models of black hole mimickers proposed so far.","Paolo Pani, Andrea Maselli","Essay selected for an Honorable Mention in the Gravity Research

659,"The overwhelming foreground contamination is one of the primary impediments to probing the EoR through measuring the redshifted 21 cm signal. Among various foreground components, radio halos are less studied and their impacts on the EoR observations are still poorly understood. In this work, we employ the Press-Schechter formalism, merger-induced turbulent re-acceleration model, and the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration to simulate the SKA ""observed"" images of radio halos. We calculate the one-dimensional power spectra from simulated images and find that radio halos can be about $10^4$, $10^3$ and $10^{2.5}$ times more luminous than the EoR signal on scales of $0.1\,\text{Mpc}^{-1} < k < 2\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the 120-128, 154-162, and 192-200 MHz bands, respectively. By examining the two-dimensional power spectra inside properly defined EoR windows, we find that the power leaked by radio halos can still be significant, as the power ratios of radio halos to the EoR signal on scales of $0.5\,\text{Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 1\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ can be up to about 230-800%, 18-95%, and 7-40% in the three bands, when the 68% uncertainties caused by the variation of the number density of bright radio halos are considered. Furthermore, we find that radio halos located inside the far side-lobes of the station beam can also impose strong contamination within the EoR window. In conclusion, we argue that radio halos are severe foreground sources and need serious treatments in future EoR experiments.","Weitian Li, Haiguang Xu, Zhixian Ma, Dan Hu, Zhenghao Zhu, Chenxi Shan, Jingying Wang, Junhua Gu, Dongchao Zheng, Xiaoli Lian, Qian Zheng, Yu Wang, Jie Zhu, Xiang-Ping Wu","main text 18 pages, 16 figures, 2 appendixes; ApJ accepted",1905.05399v1,No journal ref found,Xiang-Ping Wu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05399v1,2019-05-14 05:41:11+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Contribution of Radio Halos to the Foreground for SKA EoR Experiments,2019-05-14 05:41:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05399v1
660,"We revisit the lower bound on binary tidal deformability tilde{Lambda} imposed by a luminous kilonova/macronova, AT 2017gfo, by numerical-relativity simulations of models that are consistent with gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Contrary to the claim made in the literature, we find that binaries with tilde{Lambda}<~400 can explain the luminosity of AT 2017gfo, as long as moderate mass ejection from the remnant is assumed as had been done in previous work. The reason is that the maximum mass of a neutron star is not strongly correlated with the tidal deformability of neutron stars with a typical mass of ~1.4M_sun. If the maximum mass is so large that the binary does not collapse into a black hole immediately after merger, the mass of the ejecta can be sufficiently large irrespective of the binary tidal deformability. We present models of binary mergers with tilde{Lambda} down to 242 that satisfy the requirement on the mass of the ejecta from the luminosity of AT 2017gfo. We further find that the luminosity of AT 2017gfo could be explained by models that do not experience bounce after merger. We conclude that the luminosity of AT 2017gfo is not very useful for constraining the binary tidal deformability. Accurate estimation of the mass ratio will be necessary to establish a lower bound using electromagnetic counterparts in the future. We also caution that merger simulations that employ a limited class of tabulated equations of state could be severely biased due to the lack of generality.","Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Masaru Shibata, Keisuke Taniguchi","6 pages, 3 figures",1903.01466v3,No journal ref found,Keisuke Taniguchi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01466v3,2019-03-04 19:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|gr-qc|nucl-th,Revisiting the lower bound on tidal deformability derived by AT 2017gfo,2019-05-14 04:00:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01466v3
661,"% context We had detected J=1-0 HCO+ absorption in 12 directions lacking detected CO emission in the outskirts of the Chamaeleon complex and on 1 sightline with integrated CO emission 2.4 K-\kms. 8 sightlines had a much larger mean column density of dark neutral medium (DNM)-gas not represented in H I or CO emission-and were found to have much higher mean molecular column density. The 5 other sightlines had little or no DNM and were found to have much smaller but still detectable N(HCO+). % aims To determine N(CO) along previously-observed Chamaeleon sightlines and to determine why CO emission was not detected in directions where molecular gas is present. % methods We took \cotw\ J=1-0 absorption profiles on 5 sightlines having higher DNM and HCO+ column densities and 1 sightline with smaller N(DNM) and N(HCO+). We converted the integrated HCO+ optical depths to N(H2) in the weak-excitation limit using N(HCO+)/N(H2)$=3\times10^{-9}$ and converted the integrated CO optical depths \ICO\ to CO column density N(CO) $= 1.861\times 10^{15}\pcc \ICO^{1.131}$ as found along comparable lines of sight previously studied in J=1-0 and J=2-1 CO absorption&emission. %results CO absorption was detected along the 5 sightlines in the higher-DNM group, with CO column densities $4\times 10^{13} \pcc<$ N(CO) $<10^{15}\pcc$ that are generally below the detectability limit of CO emission surveys. %conclusions In the outskirts of the Chamaeleon complex, the presence of molecular DNM resulted primarily from small CO column densities at the onset of CO formation around the HI/\HH\ transition in diffuse molecular gas. CO relative abundances N(CO)/N(H2) $< 2\times 10^{-6}$ in the outskirts of Chamaeleon are comparable to those seen in UV absorption toward early-type stars, including in Chamaeleon.","H. Liszt, M.

662,"We present an analysis of the spectral shape and pulse profile of the accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626-67 observed with Suzaku and NuSTAR during a spin-up state. The pulsar, which experienced a torque reversal to spin-up in 2008, has a spin period of 7.7 s. Comparing the phase-averaged spectra obtained with Suzaku in 2010 and with NuSTAR in 2015, we find that the spectral shape changed between the two observations: the 3-10 keV flux increased by 5% while the 30-60 keV flux decreased significantly by 35%. Phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral analysis shows that the continuum spectrum observed by NuSTAR is well described by an empirical NPEX continuum with an added broad Gaussian emission component around the spectral peak at 20 keV. Taken together with the observed Pdot value obtained from Fermi/GBM, we conclude that the spectral change between the Suzaku and NuSTAR observations was likely caused by an increase of the accretion rate. We also report the possible detection of asymmetry in the profile of the fundamental cyclotron line. Furthermore, we present a study of the energy-resolved pulse profiles using a new relativistic ray tracing code, where we perform a simultaneous fit to the pulse profiles assuming a two-column geometry with a mixed pencil- and fan-beam emission pattern. The resulting pulse profile decompositions enable us to obtain geometrical parameters of accretion columns (inclination, azimuthal and polar angles) and a fiducial set of beam patterns. This information is important to validate the theoretical predictions from radiation transfer in a strong magnetic field.","Wataru B. Iwakiri, Katja Pottschmidt, Sebastian Falkner, Paul B.

664,"We investigate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The gas accreting on a PBH heats up by the release of the gravitational energy. As a result, the heated gas in the vicinity of the PBH emits the UV and X-ray photons. These photons can ionize and heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) around the PBH. Assuming the simple model of these emitting photons, we compute the profiles of the IGM ionization fraction and temperature around a PBH. Using these profiles, we evaluate the Compton $y$-parameter created by the IGM gas around a PBH. Finally, we estimate the CMB temperature angular power spectrum due to the PBH SZ effect in our model. We show that the SZ temperature anisotropy due to the PBHs has the flat angular power spectrum on small scale, $l\leq2000$ and could dominate the primordial temperature spectrum on smaller scales than the Silk scale. This flat spectrum extends to the scale of the ionized region by the PBH emission. We also discuss the impact of the small-scale CMB measurement on the PBH abundance based on our results.","Katsuya T.

666,"Magnetic Penrose process (MPP) is not only the most exciting and fascinating process mining the rotational energy of black hole but it is also the favoured astrophysically viable mechanism for high energy sources and phenomena. It operates in three regimes of efficiency: low, moderate and ultra, depending on the magnetization and charging of spinning black holes in astrophysical setting. In this paper we revisit MPP with a comprehensive discussion of its physics in different regimes, and compare its operation with other competing mechanisms. We show that MPP could in principle foot the bill for powering engine of such phenomena as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, relativistic jets, fast radio bursts, quasars and AGNs etc. Further it also leads to a number of important observable predictions. All this beautifully bears out the promise of a new vista of energy powerhouse heralded by Roger Penrose half a century ago through this process, and it has today risen in its magnetically empowered version of mid 1980s from a purely thought experiment of academic interest to a realistic powering mechanism for various high-energy astrophysical phenomena.","Arman Tursunov, Naresh Dadhich","26 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; Accepted in Universe; Invited Review

667,"The recent detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration has allowed for the first tests of Einstein's theory in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational interaction is simultaneously strong, non-linear and dynamical. One such test concerns the rate at which the binaries inspiral, or equivalently the rate at which the gravitational wave frequency increases, which can constrain the existence of hairy black holes. This is because black holes with scalar hair typically excite dipole radiation, which in turn leads to a faster decay rate and frequency chirping. In this paper, we present a mathematical proof that scalar hair is not sourced in vacuum, spherically symmetric spacetimes when considering extensions of Einstein's theory that break parity in gravity, focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons theory as a particular toy model. This result implies that the observational confirmation of the baldness of black holes cannot be used to constrain parity violation in gravity, unless the black holes observed are also spinning.","Pratik Wagle, Nicolas Yunes, David Garfinkle, Lydia Bieri",10 pages and 2 figures.

670,"The dynamics of active region (AR) 12673 is qualitatively studied using observational data obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager of the Solar Dynamics Observatory on August 31--September 8, 2017. This AR was remarkable for its complex structure and extraodinary flare productivity. The sunspot group in this AR consisted of (1) an old, well-developed and highly stable, coherent sunspot, which had also been observed two solar rotations earlier, and (2) a rapidly developing cluster of umbral and penumbral fragments. Cluster (2) formed two elongated, arc-shaped chains of spot elements, skirting around the major sunspot (1), with two chains of magnetic elements spatially coinciding with the arcs. AR components (1) and (2) were in relative motion, cluster (2) overtaking spot (1), and their relative velocity agrees in order of magnitude with the velocity jump over the near-surface shear layer, or leptocline. The pattern of motion of the features about the main spot bears amazing resemblance to the pattern of a fluid flow about a roundish body. This suggests that spot (1) was dynamically coupled with the surface layers, while cluster (2) developed in deeper layers of the convection zone. The magnetic-flux emergence in cluster (2) appeared to be associated with fluid motions similar to roll convection. The mutual approach of components (1) and (2) gave rise to lights bridges in the umbrae of sunspots with the magnetic field having the same sign on both sides of the bridge.",A. V.

671,"We study the optical appearance and the apparent radiation flux of a thin accretion disk around the static Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity. We confine ourselves to the astrophysically most relevant case, when the solution possesses a photon sphere, assuming that the radiation emitted by the disk is described by the Novikov-Thorne model. The observable images resemble closely the visual appearance of the Schwarzschild black hole, as only quantitative differences are present. For the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution the accretion disk appears smaller, and its emission is characterized by a higher peak of the radiation flux. In addition, the most significant part of the radiation is concentrated in a closer neighbourhood of the flux maximum. The results are obtained independently by two alternative methods, consisting of a semi-analytical scheme using the spherical symmetry of the spacetime, and a fully numerical ray-tracing procedure valid for any stationary and axisymmetric spacetime.","Galin Gyulchev, Petya Nedkova, Tsvetan Vetsov, Stoytcho Yazadjiev",21 pages; 9 figures,1905.05273v1,No journal ref found,Stoytcho Yazadjiev,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05273v1,2019-05-13 20:12:41+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE,Image of the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity with a thin   accretion disk,2019-05-13 20:12:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05273v1
672,"The delay time distribution of (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) remains poorly constrained, mainly by the small known population of Galactic binaries, the properties of short gamma-ray burst host galaxies, and inferences from $r$-process enrichment. In the new era of BNS merger detections through gravitational waves (GW), a new route to the DTD is the demographics of the host galaxies, localized through associated electromagnetic counterparts. This approach takes advantage of the correlation between star formation history (SFH) and galaxy mass, such that the convolution of the SFH and DTD impacts the BNS merger rate as a function of galaxy mass. Here we quantify this approach for a power law DTD governed by two parameters: the power law index ($\Gamma$) and a minimum delay time ($t_{\rm min}$). Under the reasonable assumption that EM counterparts are likely only detectable in the local universe, accessible by the current generation of GW detectors, we study how many host galaxies at $z\sim 0$ are required to constrain the DTD parameters. We find that the DTD is mainly imprinted in the statistics of massive galaxies (stellar mass of $M_*\gtrsim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$, comparable to the host galaxy of GW170817). Taking account of relevant uncertainties we find that $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ host galaxies are required to constrain the DTD; for a fixed value of $t_{\rm min}$, as done in previous analyses of the DTD, $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ host galaxies will suffice. Such a sample might become available within the next two decades, prior to the advent of third-generation GW detectors.","Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Edo Berger",Accepted to ApJ Letters,1904.08436v2,No journal ref found,Edo Berger,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08436v2,2019-04-17 18:00:52+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.HE,Measuring the delay time distribution of binary neutron stars.

673,"In this paper we present our results concerning the rate of generation of the giant radio pulses (GPs) from the Crab pulsar (B0531+21). One of the main goal of this investigation was to search for a possible connection between pulsar glitches and the process of GP generation. We used for our analysis results of 9 years of daily observations at frequency 111 MHz at the Large Phased Array radio telescope of Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory. It was shown that the observed rate of GPs is quite unstable during the entire span of observations. We have found a significant increase in the rate of GPs with flux density larger than 80 Jy around the epoch MJD 58064, when the largest glitch ever observed in the Crab pulsar happened. Although a considerable fraction of this enhancement could have been caused by the propagation effects that have taken place in the nebula itself, we have found indications that the pulsar had demonstrated rather high degree of intrinsic irregularity in the emission of the GPs, especially the stronger ones.","A.

674,"We investigate the growth of massive quiescent galaxies at $z<0.6$ based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey---two magnitude limited spectroscopic surveys of high data quality and completeness. Our three parameter model links quiescent galaxies across cosmic time by self-consistently evolving stellar mass, stellar population age sensitive $D_n4000$ index, half-light radius and stellar velocity dispersion. Stellar velocity dispersion is a robust proxy of dark matter halo mass; we use it to connect galaxies and dark matter halos and thus empirically constrain their coevolution. The typical rate of stellar mass growth is $\sim \! 10 \,\, M_\odot \,\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and dark matter growth rates from our empirical model are remarkably consistent with N-body simulations. Massive quiescent galaxies grow by minor mergers with dark matter halos of mass $10^{10} \,\, M_\odot \lesssim M_{DM} \lesssim 10^{12} \,\, M_\odot$ and evolve parallel to the stellar mass-halo mass relation based on N-body simulations.

675,"We describe the circumstances that led to the discovery of Kepler-36b, and the subsequent characterization of its host planetary system. The Kepler-36 system is remarkable for its physical properties: the close separation of the planets, the contrasting densities of the planets despite their proximity, and the short chaotic timescale. Its discovery and characterization was also remarkable for the novelty of the detection technique and for the precise characterization due to the large transit-timing variations caused by the close proximity of the planets, as well as the precise stellar parameters due to asteroseismology. This was the first multi-planet system whose transit data was processed using a fully consistent photometric-dynamical model, using population Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to precisely constrain system parameters. Amongst those parameters, the stellar density was found to be consistent with a complementary, concurrent asteroseismic analysis. In a first, the 3D orientation of the planets was constrained from the lack of transit-duration variations. The system yielded insights into the composition and evolution of short-period planet systems. The denser planet appears to have an Earth-like composition, with uncertainties comparable to the highest precision rocky exoplanet measurements, and the planet densities foreshadowed the rocky/gaseous boundary. The formation of this system remains a mystery, but should yield insights into the migration and evolution of compact exoplanet systems.","Eric Agol, Joshua A. Carter","31 pages, 9 figures.

676,"Previous continuum observations from the MUSTANG camera on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) of the nearby star-forming filament OMC 2/3 found elevated emission at 3.3mm relative to shorter wavelength data. As a consequence, the inferred dust emissivity index obtained from modified black body dust spectra was considerably lower than what is typically measured on $\sim 0.1 pc$ scales in nearby molecular clouds. Here we present new observations of OMC 2/3 collected with the MUSTANG-2 camera on the GBT which confirm this elevated emission. We also present for the first time sensitive 1~cm observations made with the Ka-band receiver on the GBT which also show higher than expected emission. We use these observations--- along with Herschel, JCMT, Mambo, and GISMO data--- to assemble spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a variety of structures in OMC 2/3 spanning the range $160 \mu m$ to $1 cm$. The data at 2mm and shorter are generally consistent with a modified black body spectrum and a single value of $\beta \sim 1.7$. The 3mm and 1cm data, however, lie well above such an SED. The spectrum of the long wavelength excess is inconsistent with both free-free emission and standard `Spinning Dust' models for Anomalous Microwave Emission. The 3mm and 1cm data could be explained by a much flatter dust spectrum, corresponding to $\beta \sim 0.7$, at wavelengths shorter than 2mm.","Brian Mason, Simon Dicker, Sarah Sadavoy, Sara Stanchfield, Tony Mroczkowski, Charles Romero, Rachel Friesen, Craig Sarazin, Jonathan Sievers, Thomas Stanke, Mark Devlin","17 pages, 8 figures.

677,"The absence of star formation in the bar region that has been reported for some galaxies can theoretically be explained by shear. However, it is not clear how star-forming (SF) bars fit into this picture and how the dynamical state of the bar is related to other properties of the host galaxy. We used integral-field spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE to investigate how star formation within bars is connected to structural properties of the bar and the host galaxy. We derived spatially resolved H$\alpha$ fluxes from MUSE observations from the CARS survey to estimate star formation rates in the bars of 16 nearby ($0.01 < z < 0.06$) disc galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{10} M_\odot$ and $10^{11} M_\odot$. We further performed a detailed multicomponent photometric decomposition on images derived from the data cubes. We find that bars clearly divide into SF and non-star-forming (non-SF) types, of which eight are SF and eight are non-SF. Whatever the responsible quenching mechanism is, it is a quick process compared to the lifetime of the bar. The star formation of the bar appears to be linked to the flatness of the surface brightness profile in the sense that only the flattest bars $\left(n_\mathrm{bar} \leq 0.4\right)$ are actively SF $\left(\mathrm{SFR_{b}} > 0.5 M_\odot \mathrm{yr^{-1}}\right)$. Both parameters are uncorrelated with Hubble type. We find that star formation is 1.75 times stronger on the leading than on the trailing edge and is radially decreasing. The conditions to host non-SF bars might be connected to the presence of inner rings. Additionally, from testing an AGN feeding scenario, we report that the star formation rate of the bar is uncorrelated with AGN bolometric luminosity. The results of this study may only apply to type-1 AGN hosts and need to be confirmed for the full population of barred galaxies.","Justus Neumann, Dimitri A.

We show that measuring the first (jerk) and second (jounce) derivatives of the accelerations of an ensemble of MSPs will let us infer the presence of an IMBH in a globular cluster better than measuring the sole accelerations. We test this concept by simulating a set of star clusters with and without a central IMBH to extract the distributions of the stellar jerks and jounces. We then apply this technique to the ensemble of MSPs in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Current timing observations are insufficient to constrain the presence of an IMBH and can only be used to pose upper limits on its mass. But, with few more years of observations it will be possible to test for the presence of a central IMBH with mass smaller than $\sim$ 1000 M$_{\odot}$. We conclude that jerks and jounces help significantly in reducing the upper limit of the mass of IMBHs in Galactic globular clusters.","Federico Abbate, Mario Spera, Monica Colpi","14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.05209v1,No journal ref found,Monica Colpi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05209v1,2019-05-13 18:00:10+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters: effects on jerks and   jounces of millisecond pulsars,2019-05-13 18:00:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05209v1

Here we report on the validation of the presence of the fourth planet, determining a radius of $1.73_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ R$_{\oplus}$. The four planets span the radius gap of the exoplanet population, meaning further follow-up would be worthwhile to obtain masses and test theories of the origin of the gap. In particular, the trend of increasing planetary radius with decreasing incident flux in the K2-133 system supports the claim that the gap is caused by photo-evaporation of exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, we note that K2-133 e orbits on the edge of the stars temperate zone, and that our radius measurement allows for the possibility that this is a rocky world.

680,"Black holes are the simplest macroscopic objects, and provide unique tests of General Relativity. They have been compared to the Hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a few facts about the simplest systems bound by gravity: black hole binaries. We provide strong evidence for the existence of `global' photosurfaces surrounding the binary, and of binary quasinormal modes leading to exponential decay of massless fields when the binary spacetime is slightly perturbed. These two properties go hand in hand, as they did for isolated black holes. The binary quasinormal modes have high quality factor and may be prone to resonant excitations. Finally, we show that energy extraction from binaries is generic and we find evidence of a new mechanism -- akin to the Fermi acceleration process -- whereby the binary transfers energy to its surroundings in a cascading process. The mechanism is conjectured to work when the individual components spin, or are made of compact stars.","Laura Bernard, Vitor Cardoso, Taishi Ikeda, Miguel Zilhao","6 pages, RevTex4",1905.05204v1,No journal ref found,Miguel Zilhao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05204v1,2019-05-13 18:00:05+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.HE,"The physics of black hole binaries: geodesics, relaxation modes and   energy extraction",2019-05-13 18:00:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05204v1

In searching for new z~9-10 candidates, we make full use of all available HST, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based imaging data. As a result of our expanded search and use of broader color criteria, 3 new candidate z~9-10 galaxies are identified. We also find again the z=8.683 source previously confirmed by Zitrin+2015. This brings our sample of probable z~9-11 galaxy candidates over the CANDELS+ERS fields to 19 sources in total, equivalent to 1 candidate per 47 arcmin^2 (1 per 10 WFC3/IR fields). To be comprehensive, we also discuss 28 mostly lower likelihood z~9-10 candidates, including some sources that seem to be reliably at z>8 using the HST+IRAC data alone, but which the ground-based data show are much more likely at z<4. One case example is a bright z~9.4 candidate COS910-8 which seems instead to be at z~2. Based on this expanded sample, we obtain a more robust LF at z~9 and improved constraints on the volume density of bright z~9 and z~10 galaxies.

682,"We investigate the prevalence, properties, and kinematics of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in a sample of 25 edge-on galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey. We measure ionized gas scale heights from ${\rm H\alpha}$ and find that 90% have measurable scale heights with a median of $0.8^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ kpc. From the ${\rm H\alpha}$ kinematics, we find that 60% of galaxies show a decrease in the rotation velocity as a function of height above the midplane. This lag is characteristic of eDIG, and we measure a median lag of 21 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ which is comparable to lags measured in the literature. We also investigate variations in the lag with radius. $\rm H{\small I}$ lags have been reported to systematically decrease with galactocentric radius. We find both increasing and decreasing ionized gas lags with radius, as well as a large number of galaxies consistent with no radial lag variation, and investigate these results in the context of internal and external origins for the lagging ionized gas. We confirm that the ${\rm [S{\small II}]}$/${\rm H\alpha}$ and ${\rm [N{\small II}]}$/${\rm H\alpha}$ line ratios increase with height above the midplane as is characteristic of eDIG. The ionization of the eDIG is dominated by star-forming complexes (leaky ${\rm H{\small II}}$ regions). We conclude that the lagging ionized gas is turbulent ejected gas likely resulting from star formation activity in the disk as opposed to gas in the stellar thick disk or bulge. This is further evidence for the eDIG being a product of stellar feedback and for the pervasiveness of this WIM-like phase in many local star-forming galaxies.","Rebecca C. Levy, Alberto D.

683,"We present new Chandra constraints on the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of X-ray binary (XRB) populations, and their scaling relations, for a sample of 38 nearby galaxies (D = 3.4-29 Mpc). Our galaxy sample is drawn primarily from the Spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey (SINGS), and contains a wealth of Chandra (5.8 Ms total) and multiwavelength data, allowing for star-formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M*) to be measured on subgalactic scales. We divided the 2478 X-ray detected sources into 21 subsamples in bins of specific-SFR (sSFR = SFR/M*) and constructed XLFs. To model the XLF dependence on sSFR, we fit a global XLF model, containing contributions from high-mass XRBs (HMXBs), low-mass XRBs (LMXBs), and background sources from the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) that respectively scale with SFR, M*, and sky area. We find an HMXB XLF that is more complex in shape than previously reported and an LMXB XLF that likely varies with sSFR, potentially due to an age dependence. When applying our global model to XLF data for each individual galaxy, we discover a few galaxy XLFs that significantly deviate from our model beyond statistical scatter. Most notably, relatively low-metallicity galaxies have an excess of HMXBs above ~10^38 erg/s and elliptical galaxies that have relatively rich populations of globular clusters (GCs) show excesses of LMXBs compared to the global model. Additional modeling of how the XRB XLF depends on stellar age, metallicity, and GC specific frequency is required to sufficiently characterize the XLFs of galaxies.","Bret D. Lehmer, Rafael T.

684,"Globular cluster (GC) systems demonstrate tight scaling relations with the properties of their host galaxies. In previous work, we developed an analytic model for GC formation in a cosmological context and showed that it matches nearly all of the observed scaling relations across 4 orders of magnitude in host galaxy mass. Motivated by the success of this model, we investigate in detail the physical origins and evolution of these scaling relations. The ratio of the combined mass in GCs $M_{\rm GC}$ to the host dark matter halo mass $M_h$ is nearly constant at all redshifts, but its normalization evolves by a factor of $\sim$10 from birth to $z=0$. The relation is steeper than linear at halo masses $M_h \lesssim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, primarily due to non-linearity in the stellar mass-halo mass relation. The near constancy of the ratio $M_{\rm GC}/M_h$, combined with the shape of the stellar mass-halo mass relation, sets the characteristic $U-$shape of the GC specific frequency as a function of host galaxy mass. The contribution of accreted satellite galaxies to the buildup of GC systems is a strong function of the host galaxy mass, ranging from $\approx$0% at $M_h \approx 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ to 80% at $M_h \approx 10^{15} M_{\odot}$. The metal-poor clusters are significantly more likely to form ex-situ relative to the metal-rich clusters, but a substantial fraction of metal-poor clusters still form in-situ in lower mass galaxies. Similarly, the fraction of red clusters increases from $\approx 10$% at $M_h = 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ to $\approx 60$% at $M_h \approx 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, and flattens at higher $M_h$. Clusters formation occurs essentially continuously at high redshift, while at low redshift galactic mergers become increasingly important for cluster formation.","Nick Choksi, Oleg Y.

685,"Manganese (Mn) is a key Fe-group elements, commonly employed in stellar population and nucleosynthesis studies to explore the role of SN Ia. We have developed a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of Mn, including new photo-ionisation cross-sections and new transition rates caused by collisions with H and H- atoms. We applied the model in combination with 1-dimensional (1D) LTE model atmospheres and 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection to quantify the impact of NLTE and convection on the line formation. We show that the effects of NLTE are present in Mn I and, to a lesser degree, in Mn II lines, and these increase with metallicity and with effective temperature of a model. Employing 3D NLTE radiative transfer, we derive new abundance of Mn in the Sun, A(Mn)=5.52 +/- 0.03 dex, consistent with the element abundance in C I meteorites. We also apply our methods to the analysis of three metal-poor benchmark stars. We find that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher than 1D LTE. For dwarfs, the differences between 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances are typically within 0.15 dex, however, the effects are much larger in the atmospheres of giants owing to their more vigorous convection. We show that 3D NLTE successfully solves the ionisation and excitation balance for the RGB star HD 122563 that cannot be achieved by 1D LTE or 1D NLTE modelling. For HD 84937 and HD 140283, the ionisation balance is satisfied, however, the resonance Mn I triplet lines still show somewhat lower abundances compared to the high-excitation lines. Our results for the benchmark stars confirm that 1D LTE modelling leads to significant systematic biases in Mn abundances across the full wavelength range from the blue to the IR. We also produce a list of Mn lines that are not significantly biased by 3D and can be reliably, within the 0.1 dex uncertainty, modelled in 1D NLTE.","Maria Bergemann, Andrew J.

686,"We explore the possibility that the dark-matter relic abundance is generated in a context where the inflaton is the only mediator between the visible and the hidden sectors of our universe. Due to the relatively large mass of the inflaton field, such a portal leads to an extremely feeble interaction between the dark and the visible sectors suggesting that the dark sector cannot reach any thermal equilibrium with the visible sector. After the two sectors are populated by the decay of the inflaton, a heavy dark-matter particle thermally decouples within the dark sector. Later, a lighter dark particle, whose decay width is naturally suppressed by the inflaton propagator, decays into the visible sector after it dominates the energy density of universe. This process dilutes the dark-matter relic density by injecting entropy in the visible sector. We show that an inflaton mass of $\mathcal{O}(10^{13})$ GeV together with couplings of order one are fully compatible with a dark-matter relic abundance $\Omega h^2\sim 0.1$. As a general feature of the model, the entropy dilution mechanism is accompanied by a period of early matter domination, which modifies the amount of e-folds of inflation necessary to accommodate Planck data. Moreover, the coupling of the inflaton to the dark and visible sectors brings loop contributions to the inflationary potential which can destabilize the inflation trajectory. Considering all these complementary constraints, we show that, in the context of a plateau-inflation scenario such as the $\alpha$-attractor model, the inflaton can constitute a viable mediator between the visible sector and a $\sim 10$ EeV dark-matter candidate. Furthermore, we show that improved constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index could potentially rule out dark-matter scenarios of this sort in the future.","Lucien Heurtier, Fei Huang","18 pages, 6 figures",1905.05191v1,No journal ref found,Fei Huang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05191v1,2019-05-13 18:00:00+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.HE,The Inflaton Portal to a Highly decoupled EeV Dark Matter Particle,2019-05-13 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05191v1
687,"Measurements from the Gaia satellite have greatly increased our knowledge of the dark matter velocity distributions in the Solar neighborhood. There is evidence for multiple cold structures nearby, including a high-velocity stream counterrotating relative to the Sun. This stream could significantly alter the spectrum of recoil energies and increase the annual modulation of dark matter in direct detection experiments such as DAMA/Libra. We reanalyze the experimental limits from Xenon1T, CDMSlite, PICO-60 and COSINE-100, and compare them to the results of the DAMA/Libra experiment. While we find that this new component of the dark matter velocity distribution can greatly improve the fit to the DAMA/Libra data, both spin-independent and spin-dependent interpretations of the DAMA/Libra signal with elastic and inelastic scattering continue to be ruled out by the null results of other experiments, in particular Xenon1T.","Matthew R.

689,"We place observational constraints on the Galileon ghost condensate model, a dark energy proposal in cubic-order Horndeski theories consistent with the gravitational-wave event GW170817. The model extends the cubic covariant Galileon by taking an additional higher-order field derivative $X^2$ into account. This allows for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ to access the region $-2<w_{\rm DE}<-1$ avoinding ghosts. Indeed, this peculiar evolution of $w_{\rm DE}$ is favored over that of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ ($w_{\rm DE}=-1$) from the joint data analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, baryonic acoustic oscillations, supernovae type Ia and redshift-space distortions. Furthermore, our model exhibits a better compatibility with the CMB data over the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model by suppressing large-scale temperature anisotropies. We perform a model selection analysis by using several methods and find a statistically significant preference of the Galileon ghost condensate model over $\Lambda$CDM.","Simone Peirone, Giampaolo Benevento, Noemi Frusciante, Shinji Tsujikawa","6 pages, 4 figures",1905.05166v1,No journal ref found,Shinji Tsujikawa,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05166v1,2019-05-13 17:50:32+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Cosmological data favor Galileon ghost condensate over $Î$CDM,2019-05-13 17:50:32+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05166v1

Using many simulation realisations and Stage IV survey-like specifications for the covariance matrix, we check each model's range of validity by testing for bias in the recovery of the fiducial growth rate of structure formation. The robustness of the determined range of validity is then tested by performing additional MCMC analyses using higher order multipoles, a larger survey volume and a more highly biased tracer catalogue. We find that under all tests, the TNS model's range of validity remains robust and is found to be much higher than previous estimates. The EFTofLSS model fails to capture the spectra for highly biased tracers as well as becoming biased at higher wavenumbers when considering a very large survey volume. Further, we find that the marginalised constraints on $f$ for all analyses are stronger when using the TNS model.","Benjamin Bose, Kazuya Koyama, Hans A.

692,"Cosmological analyses based on surveys of galaxy clusters observed through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect strongly rely on the mean pressure profile of the galaxy cluster population. A tension is currently observed between the cosmological constraints obtained from the analyses of the CMB primary anisotropies and those from cluster abundance in tSZ surveys. This discrepancy between the estimated cosmological constraints may be partly explained by a wrong estimate of the hydrostatic bias parameter that links the hydrostatic mass to the true mass of galaxy clusters. However, a variation of both the amplitude and the shape of the mean normalized pressure profile could also explain part of this tension. If the self-similar hypothesis is not verified in the whole mass-redshift plane, the parameters of the mean normalized pressure profile of the cluster population could be different from the ones observed at high mass and low redshift. We analyze the effects of a modification of this profile on the constraints of the $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters through the analysis of the $Planck$ tSZ power spectrum. We choose two mean normalized pressure profiles that are respectively lower and higher than the one obtained from the observation of 62 nearby clusters by $Planck$. The selection of the parameters of these two profiles is based on the current estimates of the pressure and the gas mass fraction profile distributions at low redshift. The cosmological parameters found for these two profiles are significantly different from the ones obtained with the $Planck$ pressure profile. We conclude that a ${\sim}15\%$ decrease of the amplitude of the mean normalized pressure profile would alleviate the tension observed between the constraints of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ obtained from the CMB and cluster analyses without requiring extreme values of the mass bias parameter.","F.

693,"We provide a detailed comparison of two different models for the halo redshift space power spectrum, namely the commonly applied TNS model and an effective field theory of large scale structure (EFTofLSS) inspired model. In a least $\chi^2$ analysis using simulation data, we determine ranges of validity for the models. In all our analyses we vary all nuisance parameters and the growth rate of structure, $f$, using survey specifications typical of Stage IV galaxy surveys. We determine that the TNS model with a Lorentzian damping and using standard Eulerian perturbative modelling outperforms other variants of the TNS model. But we also find that the EFTofLSS-based model is able to fit the data down to smaller scales compared to this optimal TNS variant at $z=0.5$, while the two models perform equally well at $z=1$. We then conduct an exploratory Fisher analysis to investigate parameter degeneracies, using the full anisotropic power spectrum. Next, we move on to a Bayesian MCMC analysis utilising the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole spectra, with a restricted range of scales for the latter in order for the $f$ constraints to remain unbiased. In contrast to the exploratory Fisher matrix forecasts, our MCMC analysis finds that the EFTofLSS-based model provides tighter marginalised constraints on the growth rate at $z=0.5$ than the TNS model, despite having additional nuisance parameters. The two perform comparatively at $z=1$. We also investigate the impact of priors on nuisance parameters which can be reasonably obtained from higher order statistics or external data sets. We find that conservative priors have limited impact on the constraints. Finally, we extend previous work to provide a consistent comparison between Fisher matrix and MCMC forecasts for the EFTofLSS model using the multipole expansion formalism, and reach good agreement between them.","Benjamin Bose, Alkistis Pourtsidou, Katarina MarkoviÄ, Florian Beutler","35 pages, 17 figures",1905.05122v1,No journal ref found,Florian Beutler,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05122v1,2019-05-13 16:23:26+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Assessing non-linear models for galaxy clustering II: model selection   and forecasts for Stage IV surveys,2019-05-13 16:23:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05122v1
694,"Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have been determined by observations for solar-like stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely, the magnetic field strength and the magnetic cycle period. The field strength exhibits two regimes: 1) for fast rotation it is independent of Ro, 2) for slow rotation it decays with Ro following a power law. For the magnetic cycle period two regimes of activity, the active and inactive branches, also have been identified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period, the longer the activity cycle. Using global dynamo simulations of solar like stars with Rossby numbers between ~0.4 and ~2, this paper explores the relevance of rotational shear layers in determining these observational properties. Our results, consistent with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos, show that the total magnetic field strength is independent of the rotation period. Yet at surface levels, the origin of the magnetic field is determined by Ro. While for Ro<1 it is generated in the convection zone, for Ro>1 strong toroidal fields are generated at the tachocline and rapidly emerge towards the surface. In agreement with the observations, the magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period. However, a bifurcation is observed for Ro~1, separating a regime where oscillatory dynamos operate mainly in the convection zone, from the regime where the tachocline has a predominant role. In the latter the cycles are believed to result from the periodic energy exchange between the dynamo and the magneto-shear instabilities developing in the tachocline and the radiative interior.","G.

696,"We present predictions for the gravitational-wave (GW) emission of three-dimensional supernova (SN) simulations performed for a 15 solar-mass progenitor with the Prometheus-Vertex code using energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport. The progenitor adopted from stellar evolution calculations including magnetic fields had a fairly low specific angular momentum (j_Fe <~ 10^{15} cm^2/s) in the iron core (central angular velocity ~0.2 rad/s), which we compared to simulations without rotation and with artificially enhanced rotation (j_Fe <~ 2*10^{16} cm^2/s; central angular velocity ~0.5 rad/s). Our results confirm that the time-domain GW signals of SNe are stochastic, but possess deterministic components with characteristic patterns at low frequencies (<~200 Hz), caused by mass motions due to the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), and at high frequencies, associated with gravity-mode oscillations in the surface layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS). Non-radial mass motions in the post-shock layer as well as PNS convection are important triggers of GW emission, whose amplitude scales with the power of the hydrodynamic flows. There is no monotonic increase of the GW amplitude with rotation, but a clear correlation with the strength of SASI activity. Our slowly rotating model is a fainter GW emitter than the non-rotating model because of weaker SASI activity and damped convection in the post-shock layer and PNS. In contrast, the faster rotating model exhibits a powerful SASI spiral mode during its transition to explosion, producing the highest GW amplitudes with a distinctive drift of the low-frequency emission peak from ~80-100 Hz to ~40-50 Hz. This migration signifies shock expansion, whereas non-exploding models are discriminated by the opposite trend.","H. Andresen, E. MÃ¼ller, H. -Th. Janka, A. Summa, K. Gill, M.

698,"The mergers of compact binaries with at least one neutron star component have been recently recognized as the potential leading sites of the production and ejection of r-process elements. Discoveries of galactic binary pulsars, short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave detections have all been constraining the rate of these events while the gravitational wave plus broad-band electromagnetic coverage of binary neutron-star merger (GW170817) has also placed constraints on the properties (mass and composition) of the merger ejecta. But uncertainties and ambiguities in modeling the optical and infra-red emission make it difficult to definitively measure the distribution of heavy isotopes in these mergers. In contrast, gamma-rays emitted in the decay of these neutron-rich ejecta may provide a more direct measurement of the yields. We calculate the gamma production in remnants of neutron star mergers, considering two epochs: a kilonova epoch, lasting about two weeks, and a much later epoch of tens and hundreds of thousands of years after the merger. For the kilonova epoch, when the expanding ejecta is still only partially transparent to gamma radiation, we use 3D radiative transport simulations to produce the spectra. We show that the gamma-ray spectra associated with beta- and alpha-decay provide a fingerprint of the ejecta properties and, for a sufficiently nearby remnant, may be detectable, even for old remnants. We compare our gamma spectra to the potential detection limits of next generation detectors, including LOX, AMEGO and COSI.","Oleg Korobkin, Aimee M. Hungerford, Christopher L. Fryer, Matthew R.

700,"High-resolution, near-infrared spectra will be the primary tool for finding and characterizing Earth-like planets around low-mass stars. Yet, the properties of exoplanets can not be precisely determined without accurate and precise measurements of the host star. Spectra obtained with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) simultaneously provide diagnostics for most stellar parameters, but the first step in any analysis is the determination of the effective temperature. Here we report the calibration of high-resolution H-band spectra to accurately determine effective temperature for stars between 4000-3000 K ($\sim$K8--M5) using absorption line depths of Fe I, OH, and Al I. The field star sample used here contains 254 K and M stars with temperatures derived using BT-Settl synthetic spectra. We use 106 stars with precise temperatures in the literature to calibrate our method with typical errors of about 140 K, and systematic uncertainties less than $\sim$120 K. For the broadest applicability, we present T$_{\rm eff}$--line-depth-ratio relationships, which we test on 12 members of the TW Hydrae Association and at spectral resolving powers between $\sim$10,000--120,000.

702,"A number of recent experimental studies have shown that solid-state complex organic molecules (COMs) can form under conditions that are relevant to the CO freeze-out stage in dense clouds. In this work, we show that alcohols can be formed well before the CO freeze-out stage (i.e., in the H2O-rich ice phase). This joint experimental and computational investigation shows that the isomers, n- and i-propanol (H3CCH2CH2OH and H3CCHOHCH3) and n- and i-propenol (H3CCHCHOH and H3CCOHCH2), can be formed in radical-addition reactions starting from propyne (H3CCCH) + OH at the low temperature of 10 K, where H3CCCH is one of the simplest representatives of stable carbon chains already identified in the interstellar medium (ISM). The resulting average abundance ratio of 1:1 for n-propanol:i-propanol is aligned with the conclusions from the computational work that the geometric orientation of strongly interacting species is influential to the extent of which 'mechanism' is participating, and that an assortment of geometries leads to an averaged-out effect. Three isomers of propanediol are also tentatively identified in the experiments. It is also shown that propene and propane (H3CCHCH2 and H3CCH2CH3) are formed from the hydrogenation of H3CCCH. Computationally-derived activation barriers give additional insight into what types of reactions and mechanisms are more likely to occur in the laboratory and in the ISM. Our findings not only suggest that the alcohols studied here share common chemical pathways and therefore can show up simultaneously in astronomical surveys, but also that their extended counterparts that derive from polyynes containing H3C(CC)nH structures may exist in the ISM. Such larger species, like fatty alcohols, are the possible constituents of simple lipids that primitive cell membranes on the early Earth are thought to be partially composed of.","D. Qasim, G.

703,"Transients XrB exhibit different spectral shapes during their evolution. In luminosity-color diagrams, their X-ray behavior forms unexplained q-shaped cycles. We proposed a framework where the innermost regions of the accretion disk evolve as a response to variations imposed in the outer regions. These variations lead not only to modifications of the inner disk accretion rate $\dot m_{in}$ but also to the evolution of the transition radius $r_J$ between two regions. The outermost region is a standard accretion disk (SAD), whereas the innermost region is a jet-emitting disk (JED) where all the disk angular momentum is carried away vertically by two self-confined jets. In the previous papers of this series, it has been shown that such a configuration reproduces the typical spectral properties of the five canonical XrB states. The aim of this paper is now to replicate all X-ray spectra and radio emission observed during GX 339-4 2010-2011 outburst. We use the 2T plasma code presented in papers II and III, and design an automatic fitting procedure that gives the parameters $(\dot m_{in},r_J)$ that best fit each X-ray spectrum. We use RXTE/PCA X-ray data spread over 438 days, together with radio observations at 9 GHz (ATCA). We obtain the time distributions of $\dot m_{in}$ and $r_J$ that uniquely reproduce the X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of the whole cycle. Using the classical self-absorbed jet synchrotron emission model, the JED-SAD configuration reproduces also very satisfactorily the radio properties, in particular the switch-off and -on events and the radio-X-ray correlation. Within the JED-SAD framework, radio emission can be used to constrain the underlying disk configuration. If this result is confirmed using other outbursts from GX 339-4 or other X-ray binaries, then radio could be indeed used as another means to indirectly probe disk physics.","G. Marcel, J.

704,"In this work, we study matter in the cores of proto-neutron stars, focusing on the impact of their composition on the stellar structure. We begin by examining the effects of finite temperature (through a fixed entropy per baryon) and lepton fraction on purely nucleonic matter by making use of the DSH model . We then turn our attention to a relativistic mean-field model containing exotic degrees of freedom, the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, again, under the conditions of finite temperature and trapped neutrinos. In the latter, since both hyperons and quarks are found in the cores of large-mass stars, their interplay and the possibility of mixtures of phases is taken into account and analyzed.

705,"Superflares on the solar type stars observed by $Kepler$ demonstrate the contrast in the optical continuum of the order 1%. The mechanism of formation of this radiation is not firmly established. We consider a model where the stellar atmosphere is irradiated by the soft X rays emitted from the flaring loop filled with the hot plasma. This radiation heats a large area beneath the loop. Subsequent cooling due to H$^{-}$ and hydrogen free-bound emission can contribute to the observed enhanced continuum. We solve the equations of radiative transfer, statistical equilibrium, ionization balance and radiative equilibrium in the model atmosphere illuminated by the soft X rays, compute the temperature and the electron density in the atmosphere and find the emergent radiation. We found that for the flare loop of the length $\sim10^{10}$ cm and plasma density $10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the temperature $\log T = 7.5$ can provide the contrast at 5000 angstrom of 0.8% if the heated region is $\sim$10% of the visible stellar disk.",B.

706,"% context {Magnetic field vector measurements are always ambiguous, i.e., two or more field vectors are solutions of the observed polarisation.} % aims {The aim of the present paper is to solve the ambiguity by comparing the ambiguous field vectors obtained in the same prominence observed on two following days. The effect of the solar rotation is to modify the scattering angle of the prominence radiation, which modifies the symmetry of the ambiguous solutions. This method, which is a kind of tomography, was successfully applied in the past to the average magnetic field vector of 20 prominences observed at the Pic-du-Midi. The aim of the present paper is to apply this method to a prominence observed with spatial resolution at the TH\'EMIS telescope (European site at Iza\~na, Tenerife Island).} % methods {The magnetic field vector is measured by interpretation of the Hanle effect observed in the \ion{He}{i} D$_3$ 5876 \AA\, line, within the horizontal field vector hypothesis for simplicity. The ambiguity is first solved by comparing the two pairs of solutions obtained for a ""big pixel"" determined by averaging the observed Stokes parameters in a large region at the prominence center. Then, each pixel is disambiguated by selecting the closest solution in a propagation from the prominence center to the prominence boundary.} % results {The results previously obtained on averaged prominences are all recovered: Inverse Polarity, small angle of about $-21^{\circ}$ between the magnetic field vector and the filament long axis, within the Inverse Polarity scheme. The magnetic field strength, of about 6 G, is found to slightly increase with height, as previously observed also. The new result is the observed decreasing with height, of the absolute value of the angle between the magnetic field vector and the filament long axis.}","T. Kalewicz, V.

707,"Ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) are objects with spectral types equal or later than M7. Most of them have been discovered using wide-field imaging surveys. The Virtual Observatory (VO) has proven to be of great utility to efficiently exploit these astronomical resources. We aim to validate a VO methodology designed to discover and characterize UCDs in the J-PLUS photometric survey. J-PLUS is a multiband survey carried out with the wide angle T80Cam optical camera mounted on the 0.83-m telescope JAST/T80 in the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre. In this work we make use of the Internal Data Release (IDR) covering 528 deg$^2$. We complement J-PLUS photometry with other catalogues in the optical and IR using VOSA, a VO tool that estimates physical parameters from the spectral energy distribution fitting to collections of theoretical models. Objects identified as UCDs are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using parallaxes and proper motions from Gaia DR2. We identify 559 UCDs, ranging from i=16.2 to 22.4 mag, of which 187 are candidate UCDs not previously reported in the literature. This represents an increase in the number of known UCDs of about 50% in the studied region of the sky, particularly at the faint end of our sensitivity, which is interesting as reference for future wide and deep surveys such as Euclid. Three candidates constitute interesting targets for exoplanet surveys because of their proximity (<40 pc). We also analyze the kinematics of UCDs in our catalogue and find evidence that it is consistent with a Galactic thin-disk population, except for 6 objects that might be members of the thick disk. The results obtained validate the proposed methodology, which will be used in future J-PLUS and J-PAS releases. Considering the region of the sky covered by the IDR used, we foresee to discover 3,000-3,500 new UCDs at the end of the J-PLUS project.","E. Solano, E. L. MartÃ­n, J. A. Caballero, C. Rodrigo, R. E.

708,"A recently proposed Dynamical Space-time Cosmology (DSC) that unifies dark energy and dark matter is studied. The general action of this scenario includes a Lagrange multiplier, which is coupled to the energy momentum tensor and a scalar field which is different from quintessence. First for various types of potentials we implement a critical point analysis and we find solutions which lead to cosmic acceleration and under certain conditions to stable late-time attractors. Then the DSC cosmology is confronted with the latest cosmological data from low-redshift probes, namely measurements of the Hubble parameter and standard candles (Pantheon SnIa, Quasi-stellar objects). Performing an overall likelihood analysis and using the appropriate information criteria we find that the explored DSC models are in very good agreement with the data. We also find that one of the DSC models shows a small but non-zero deviation from $\Lambda$ cosmology, nevertheless the confidence level is close to $\sim 1.5\sigma$.","Fotios K.

709,"Accurate determinations of atmospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity log $g$ and metallicity [Fe/H]) and distances for large complete samples are of vital importance for various Galactic studies. We have developed a photometric method to select red giant stars and estimate their atmospheric parameters from the photometric colors provided by the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) data release (DR) 1.1, using stars in common with the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys as a training set. Distances are estimated with two different approaches: one based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes for nearby ($d \leq 4.5$ kpc) bright stars and another based on the absolute magnitudes predicted by intrinsic color $(g-i)_0$ and photometric metallicity [Fe/H] for distant ($d > 4.5$ kpc) faint stars. Various tests show that our method is capable of delivering atmospheric parameters with a precision of $\sim$80 K for $T_{\rm eff}$, $\sim$0.18 dex for [Fe/H] and $\sim$0.35 dex for log $g$, but with a significant systematic error at log $g \sim$ 2.3. For distances delivered from $(g-i)_0$ and photometric [Fe/H], our test with the member stars of globular clusters show a median uncertainty of 16 per cent with a negligible zero-point offset. Using this method, atmospheric parameters and distances of nearly one million red giant stars are derived from SMSS DR1.1. Proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 are available for almost all of the red giant stars, and radial velocity measurements from several large spectroscopic surveys are available for 44 per cent of these.

We study the gravitational waves emitted during ringdown from black holes without hair in Horndeski gravity, demonstrating the qualitative differences between such emission in General Relativity and Horndeski theory. In particular, Quasi-Normal Mode frequencies associated with the scalar field spectrum can appear in the emitted gravitational radiation. Analytic expressions for error estimates for both the black hole and Horndeski parameters are calculated using a Fisher Matrix approach, with constraints on the `effective mass' of the Horndeski scalar field of order $\sim 10^{-17}$eV$c^{-2}$ or tighter being shown to be achievable in some scenarios.

711,"We consider Higgs inflation with an $\alpha R^2$ term. This term adds a new scalar degree of freedom, which leads to a two-field model of inflation. We do a complete slow-roll analysis of the three-dimensional parameter space of the $R^2$ coefficient $\alpha$, the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$. We find three classes of inflationary solutions. We also find that pure Higgs inflation is impossible when the $R^2$ term is present regardless of how small $\alpha$ is. However, we can have Higgs-like inflation, where the amplitude of the perturbations does not depend on $\alpha$ and the predictions as a function of e-folds are the same as in Higgs inflation, although the inflationary trajectory is curved in field space. The spectral index is $0.939 < n_R < 0.967$, and constraining it to the observed range, the tensor-to-scalar ratio varies from $3.8\times10^{-3}$ to the maximum allowed by observations, $0.079$. Observational constraints on isocurvature perturbations contribute to these limits, whereas non-Gaussianity is automatically in the range allowed by observations.","Vera-Maria Enckell, Kari Enqvist, Syksy Rasanen, Lumi-Pyry Wahlman","v2.

712,"Additional scalar fields from scalar-tensor, modified gravity or higher dimensional theories beyond general relativity may account for dark energy and the accelerating expansion of the Universe. These theories have lead to proposed models of screening mechanisms, such as chameleon and symmetron fields, to account for the tight experimental bounds on fifth-force searches. Cold atom systems have been very successfully used to constrain the parameters of these screening models, and may in future eliminate the interesting parameter space of some models entirely. In this paper, we show how to manipulate a Bose-Einstein condensate to simulate the effect of any screened scalar field model coupled conformally to the metric. We give explicit expressions for the simulation of various common models. This result may be useful for investigating the computationally challenging evolution of particles on a screened scalar field background, as well as for testing the metrology scheme of an upcoming detector proposal.","Daniel Hartley, Christian KÃ¤ding, Richard Howl, Ivette Fuentes","26 pages, 3 figures",1811.06927v2,No journal ref found,Ivette Fuentes,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06927v2,2018-11-16 17:20:57+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|cond-mat.quant-gas|quant-ph,Quantum simulation of dark energy candidates,2019-05-13 12:20:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06927v2

714,"The Ophiuchus cloud complex is one of the best laboratories to study the earlier stages of the stellar and protoplanetary disc evolution. The wealth of accurate astrometric measurements contained in the Gaia Data Release 2 can be used to update the census of Ophiuchus member candidates. We seek to find potential new members of Ophiuchus and identify those surrounded by a circumstellar disc. We constructed a control sample composed of 188 bona fide Ophiuchus members. Using this sample as a reference we applied three different density-based machine learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and HDBSCAN) to a sample drawn from the Gaia catalogue centred on the Ophiuchus cloud. The clustering analysis was applied in the five astrometric dimensions defined by the three-dimensional Cartesian space and the proper motions in right ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically identify a similar set of candidate members in a main cluster with astrometric properties consistent with those of the control sample. The increased flexibility of the OPTICS and HDBSCAN algorithms enable these methods to identify a secondary cluster. We constructed a common sample containing 391 member candidates including 166 new objects, which have not yet been discussed in the literature. By combining the Gaia data with 2MASS and WISE photometry, we built the spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to $22\microm$ for a subset of 48 objects and found a total of 41 discs, including 11 Class II and 1 Class III new discs. Density-based clustering algorithms are a promising tool to identify candidate members of star forming regions in large astrometric databases.

We present a sample of 4388 AGNs with available radio core-dominance parameters defined as the ratio of the core flux densities to extended ones, namely, R = Score/Sext., which includes 630 Fermi-detected AGNs respect to the catalog of 4FGL, the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope source catalog, and the rest of them are non-Fermi-detected AGNs. In our sample, 584 blazars are Fermi-detected and 1310 are not, and also consists of other subclasses such as Seyfert, Fanaroff-Riley I/II and normal galaxies. We investigate various different properties between Fermi-detected AGNs and non-Fermi-detected ones by using the core-dominance parameters as the previous study has shown that R is a good indication of beaming effect. Methods. We then calculate the radio spectral indices for whole sample and adopt {\gamma}-ray photon indices for Fermi AGNs from 4FGL catalog for discussing their different performances on different subclasses, and obtain the relation between core-dominance parameters and radio spectral indices for both Fermi and non-Fermi sources according to the two components model on radio band, which are consistent with our previous study. Results. We found that the core-dominance parameters and radio spectral indices are quite different for different subclasses of AGNs, not only for Fermi sources but also non-Fermi sources, particularly, R for the former ones is averagely higher than later ones. We also adopt the same relation on core-dominance parameters and {\gamma}-ray photon indices for Fermi sources by taking the same assumption with two components model on {\gamma}-ray band, and obtain the fitting results indicating that the {\gamma}-ray emissions of Fermi blazars are mainly from the core component, which is perhaps associated with the beaming effect. Therefore, Fermi blazars are beamed.","Zhi-Yuan Pei, Jun-Hui Fan, Denis Bastieri, Jiang-He Yang, Hu-Bing Xiao","14 pages, 18 figures",1905.04984v1,No journal ref found,Hu-Bing Xiao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04984v1,2019-05-13 11:44:21+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.HE,Radio core dominance of Fermi-LAT selected AGNs,2019-05-13 11:44:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04984v1
718,"With the availability of parallaxes provided by the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, it is possible to construct the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) of barium and related stars with unprecedented accuracy. A direct result from the derived HRD is that subgiant CH stars occupy the same region as barium dwarfs, contrary to what their designations imply. By comparing the position of barium stars in the HRD with STAREVOL evolutionary tracks, it is possible to evaluate their masses, provided the metallicity is known. We used an average metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.25 and derived the mass distribution of barium giants. The distribution peaks around 2.5 Msun with a tail at higher masses up to 4.5 Msun. This peak is also seen in the mass distribution of a sample of normal K and M giants used for comparison and is associated with stars located in the red clump. When we compare these mass distributions, we see a deficit of low-mass (1 - 2 Msun) barium giants. This is probably because low-mass stars reach large radii at the tip of the red giant branch, which may have resulted in an early binary interaction. Among barium giants, the high-mass tail is however dominated by stars with barium indices of less than unity, based on a visual inspection of the barium spectral line; that is, these stars have a very moderate barium line strength. We believe that these stars are not genuine barium giants, but rather bright giants, or supergiants, where the barium lines are strengthened because of a positive luminosity effect.

719,"We present an overview of the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS) for radio pulsars and fast transients. The survey uses the high-band antennas of the LOFAR Superterp, the dense inner part of the LOFAR core, to survey the northern sky (dec > 0 deg) at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz. A total of 219 tied-array beams (coherent summation of station signals, covering 12 square degrees), as well as three incoherent beams (covering 67 square degrees) are formed in each survey pointing. For each ofthe 222 beams, total intensity is recorded at 491.52 us time resolution. Each observation integrates for 1 hr and covers 2592 channels from 119 to 151 MHz. This instrumental setup allows LOTAAS to reach a detection threshold of 1 to 5 mJy for periodic emission. Thus far, the LOTAAS survey has resulted in the discovery of 73 radio pulsars. Among these are two mildly recycled binary millisecond pulsars (P = 13 and 33 ms), as well as the slowest-spinning radio pulsar currently known (P = 23.5 s). The survey has thus far detected 311 known pulsars, with spin periods ranging from 4 ms to 5.0 s and dispersion measures from 3.0 to 217 pc/cc. Known pulsars are detected at flux densities consistent with literature values. We find that the LOTAAS pulsar discoveries have, on average, longer spin periods than the known pulsar population. This may reflect different selection biases between LOTAAS and previous surveys, though it is also possible that slower-spinning pulsars preferentially have steeper radio spectra. LOTAAS is the deepest all-sky pulsar survey using a digital aperture array; we discuss some of the lessons learned that can inform the approach for similar surveys using future radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array.","S.

720,Killing symmetries are revisited in $d$$=$$5$ bulk geometric torsion (GT) perturbation theory to investigate the perihelion precession. Computation reveals a non-perturbative (NP) modification to the precession known in General Relativity (GR). Remarkably the analysis re-assures our proposed holographic correspondence between a perturbative GT in bulk and a boundary GR coupled to $B_{2}$$ \wedge $$F_{2}$. In fact the topological correction is sourced by a non-Newtonian potential in GR and we identify it with an ``electro-gravito'' dipole. Interestingly the dipole correction is shown to possess its origin in a $4$-form underlying a propagating GT and leads to a NP gravity in $d$$=$$4$.,"R. Nitish, Rohit K.

721,"Ariel has been selected as ESA's M4 mission for launch in 2028 and is designed for the characterisation of a large and diverse population of exoplanetary atmospheres to provide insights into planetary formation and evolution within our Galaxy. Here we present a study of Ariel's capability to observe currently-known exoplanets and predicted TESS discoveries. We use the Ariel Radiometric model (ArielRad) to simulate the instrument performance and find that ~2000 of these planets have atmospheric signals which could be characterised by Ariel. This list of potential planets contains a diverse range of planetary and stellar parameters. From these we select an example Mission Reference Sample (MRS), comprised of 1000 diverse planets to be completed within the primary mission life, which is consistent with previous studies. We also explore the mission capability to perform an in-depth survey into the atmospheres of smaller planets, which may be enriched or secondary. Earth-sized planets and Super-Earths with atmospheres heavier than H/He will be more challenging to observe spectroscopically. However, by studying the time required to observe ~110 Earth-sized/Super-Earths, we find that Ariel could have substantial capability for providing in-depth observations of smaller planets. Trade-offs between the number and type of planets observed will form a key part of the selection process and this list of planets will continually evolve with new exoplanet discoveries replacing predicted detections. The Ariel target list will be constantly updated and the MRS re-selected to ensure maximum diversity in the population of planets studied during the primary mission life.","Billy Edwards, Lorenzo Mugnai, Giovanna Tinetti, Enzo Pascale, Subhajit Sarkar",No comment found,1905.04959v1,No journal ref found,Subhajit Sarkar,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04959v1,2019-05-13 10:55:04+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.IM,An Updated Study of Potential Targets for Ariel,2019-05-13 10:55:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04959v1
722,"This paper is the first in a set that analyses the covariance matrices of clustering statistics obtained from several approximate methods for gravitational structure formation. We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, Peak Patch, and Pinocchio), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (Patchy and Halogen), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (log-normal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values inferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5% for our lower mass threshold, and 10% for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20% depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.","Martha Lippich, Ariel G.

723,"Axions and axion like particles in general are consequences of the extensions of the standard model in particle physics. Axions have been proposed as hypothetical pseudo-scalar particles in particle physics to solve the strong Charge-Parity problem using quantum chromodynamics. These particles are also proposed to be an attractive candidate for cold dark matter in the Universe. The current understanding of the existence and properties of the axions is not very clear and these hypothetical particles remain elusive. However many theoretical and experimental searches are being made for understanding and constraining the properties of axions via detection of axion like particles. The term axion like particles is used to include different types of axions going beyond the standard model. In this paper, we review the different physical properties of axions and axion like particles and their possible sources in the laboratory and Universe. We discuss different experimental set ups for detection of axion like particles proposed in the literature.

724,"In this paper, we explore the behavior of optical polarization during the multi-wavelength outburst of the blazar Mrk 421 detected in February 2010. We use optical polarization measurements in the wavelength range 500-700 nm from SPOL observations available between January 1, 2010 and March 31, 2010 (MJD 55197-55286) including the period of multi-wavelength flaring activity detected from the source around February 16-17, 2010 (MJD 55243-55244). We also use near simultaneous optical and radio flux measurements from SPOL in V and R bands and OVRO at 15 GHz respectively. We find that the emissions in the optical and radio bands do not show any significant change in the source activity unlike at X-ray and $\gamma$--ray energies during the outburst. The optical and radio flux measurements are found to be consistent with the long term quiescent state emission of the source. Moreover, the linear polarization in the wavelength range 500-700 nm decreases to a minimum value of 1.6$\%$ during the X-ray and $\gamma$--ray outburst which is significantly lower than the long term average value of $\sim$ 4.2$\%$. The angle of polarization varies between 114$^\circ$-163$^\circ$ with a preferred average value of $\sim$ 137$^\circ$ during this period. We estimate the degree of polarization intrinsic to the jet taking into account the host galaxy contamination in R band and compare this with the theoretical synchrotron polarization estimated for a power law distribution of relativistic electrons gyrating in an emission region filled with ordered and chaotic magnetic fields. The intrinsic linear polarization estimated for different epochs during the above period is found to be consistent with the theoretical synchrotron polarization produced by the relativistic electrons with power law spectral index $\sim$ 2.2.","K K Singh, P J Meintjes, B van Soelen, F A Ramamonjisoa, B Vaidya","4 Figures, 3 Tables, Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and

725,"Context. The role of magnetic fields during the formation of high-mass stars is not yet fully understood, and the processes related to the early fragmentation and collapse are largely unexplored today. The high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19 is a well known source, presenting several cores at different evolutionary stages. Aims. We determine the magnetic field morphology and strength in the high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19, to investigate its relation to the evolutionary sequence of the cores. Methods. We use Band 7 ALMA observations in full polarisation mode and we analyse the polarised dust emission. We estimate the magnetic field strength via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and the Structure Function methods. Results. We resolve several protostellar cores embedded in a bright and dusty filamentary structure. The polarised emission is clearly detected in six regions. Moreover the magnetic field is oriented along the filament and appears perpendicular to the direction of the outflows. We suggest an evolutionary sequence of the magnetic field, and the less evolved hot core exhibits a magnetic field stronger than the more evolved one. We detect linear polarisation from thermal line emission and we tentatively compared linear polarisation vectors from our observations with previous linearly polarised OH masers observations. We also compute the spectral index, the column density and the mass for some of the cores. Conclusions. The high magnetic field strength and the smooth polarised emission indicate that the magnetic field could play an important role for the fragmentation and the collapse process in the star forming region G9.62+019 and that the evolution of the cores can be magnetically regulated. On average, the magnetic field derived by the linear polarised emission from dust, thermal lines and masers is pointing in the same direction and has consistent strength.","Daria Dall'Olio, W. H. T.

726,"The exact nature of the arms of spiral galaxies is still an open question. It has been widely assumed that spiral arms in galaxies with two distinct symmetrical arms are the products of density waves that propagate around the disk, with the spiral arms being visibly enhanced by the star formation that is triggered as the passing wave compresses gas in the galaxy disk. Such a persistent wave would propagate with an approximately constant angular speed, its pattern speed Op. The quasi-stationary density wave theory can be tested by measuring this quantity and showing that it does not vary with radius in the galaxy. Unfortunately, this measurement is difficult because Op is only indirectly connected to observables such as the stellar rotation speed. Here, we use the detailed information on stellar populations of the grand-design spiral galaxy UGC 3825, extracted from spectral mapping, to measure the offset between young stars of a known age and the spiral arm in which they formed, allowing the first direct measure of Op at a range of radii. The offset in this galaxy is found to be as expected for a pattern speed that varies little with radius, indicating consistency with a quasi-stationary density wave, and lending credence to this new method.","Thomas Peterken, Michael Merrifield, Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, Niv Drory, Coleman Krawczyk, Karen Masters, Anne-Marie Weijmans, Kyle Westfall","24 pages, 4 figures.

727,"We investigate a possibility to find an accreting isolated black hole (IBH) with masses $1-100~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within Central Galactic Molecular Zone (CMZ) in submillimetre and IR spectral range with help of planned space observatories James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Millimetron (MM). We assume the spherical mode of accretion. We develop the simplest possible quantitative model of the formation of radiation spectrum in this range due to synchrotron emission which qualitatively agrees with much more complicated numerical models for expected values of accretion rate.   If a substantial fraction of LIGO events was caused by merger of primordial black holes, the JWST would be able to find them provided that there is a cusp in distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy and that the accretion efficiency parameter $\lambda $ defined as the ratio of accretion rate onto IBH to its Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton value is larger than $\sim 10^{-2}$. A comparable amount of IBHs is also predicted by recent models of their formation due to stellar evolution. MM capabilities are hampered by the effect of confusion due to distant submillimetre galaxies, but it can also be used for such purposes provided that the confusion effect is properly dealt with. In case of efficient accretion with $\lambda \sim 1$ both instruments could detect IBHs with quite low number densities, down to $10^{-6}~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$.","P. B. Ivanov, V. N. Lukash, S. V.

729,"We have studied the paradigm of cosmic inflation using the simplest model based on the idea of supersymmetric hybrid inflation with non-minimal coupling to gravity, specially under the slow-roll approximation following the superconformal approach to supergravity. It is found that within a range of values of the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$, the model can accommodate the inflation data reported by the Planck ($n_s$ and upper limit of $r$) and BICEP2/Keck (upper limit of $r$) collaborations. The study shows that the most probable value of $\xi$ should be $\sim 0.0134\pm0.0005$. That is coupling is found to be very week. Within this range of $\xi$, the values of $r$ estimated from our model for $50 - 70$ e-foldings are found to be laying well below the upper limits set by the Planck and BICEP2/Keck collaborations. Similarly, values of $n_s$ obtained for the said parameters are in good agreement with its latest data of the Planck collaboration.

730,"Most stars form in binaries and the evolution of their discs remains poorly understood. To shed light on this subject, we carry out 3D ideal MHD simulations with the AMR code FLASH of binary star formation for separations of $10-20\,\mathrm{AU}$. We run a simulation with no initial turbulence (NT), and two with turbulent Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = \sigma_v/c_s = 0.1$ and $0.2$ (T1 and T2) for $5000\,\mathrm{yr}$ after protostar formation. By the end of the simulations the circumbinary discs in NT and T1, if any, have radii of $\lesssim20\,\mathrm{AU}$ with masses $\lesssim0.02\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, while T2 hosts a circumbinary disc with radius $\sim70-80\,\mathrm{AU}$ and mass $\sim0.12\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. These circumbinary discs formed from the disruption of circumstellar discs and harden the binary orbit. Our simulated binaries launch large single outflows. We find that NT drives the most massive outflows, and also removes large quantities of linear and angular momentum. T2 produces the least efficient outflows concerning mass, momentum and angular momentum ($\sim$61 per cent, $\sim$71 per cent, $\sim$68 per cent of the respective quantities in NT). We conclude that while turbulence helps to build circumbinary discs which organise magnetic fields for efficient outflow launching, too much turbulence may also disrupt the ordered magnetic field structure required for magneto-centrifugal launching of jets and outflows. We also see evidence for episodic accretion during the binary star evolution. We conclude that the role of turbulence in building large circumbinary discs may explain some observed very old ($>10\,\mathrm{Myr}$) circumbinary discs. The longer lifetime of circumbinary discs may increase the likelihood of planet formation.","Rajika L. Kuruwita, Christoph Federrath","Accepted to MNRAS. 17 pages, 11 figures. arXiv admin note: text

Such measurements are soon to be expected from the ongoing NICER mission and will complement the constraints on the EOS from gravitational-wave detections. Thanks to the large statistical range of our EOS library, we can obtain a first quantitative estimate of the commonly made assumption that the high-density part of the EOS is best constrained when measuring the radius of the most massive, albeit rare, neutron stars with masses $M \gtrsim 2.1\,M_\odot$. At the same time, we find that radius measurements of neutron stars with masses $M \simeq 1.7-1.85\,M_\odot$ can provide the strongest constraints on the low-density part of the EOS. Finally, we quantify how radius measurements by future missions can further improve our understanding of the EOS of matter at nuclear densities.","Lukas R. Weih, Elias R.

732,"The degree of turbulent pressure support by residual gas motions in galaxy clusters is not well known. The X-ray spectrometer on board Hitomi satellite has measured the turbulent velocities in the centre of the Perseus cluster, whereas the mass modelling of combined X-ray and Sunyaev Zel'dovich observations gives an estimate of this support in the outer regions of galaxy clusters. Cosmological simulations may help to quantify the amount of turbulent pressure, but the estimates vary widely. In this work, we test a new filtering technique to disentangle the bulk gas motion from the turbulent one in high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters using the cosmological hydro code ENZO. We focused on the ratio of non-thermal pressure to total gas pressure as a function of cluster-centric distance. We find that the radial behavior can be described by a simple polynomial functional form. The typical non-thermal pressure support in the centre of clusters is $\sim$5\% increasing to $\sim$15\% in the outskirts in line with the pressure excess found in recent X-ray observations. We also find that the total mass recovered under the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium is affected by an hydrostatic mass bias with a no-negligible contribution from residual radial accelerations of the gas, often yielding differences compared to the real turbulent energy budget in simulations. Our study highlights the relation between shocks and radial accelerations, and the role of gas dynamical processes in the hydrostatic mass bias.","M. Angelinelli, F. Vazza, C. Giocoli, T. W.

733,"We reexamine the results presented in a recent work by Nielsen et al. [1], in which the properties of the noise residuals in the 40\,ms chirp domain of GW150914 were investigated. This paper confirmed the presence of strong (i.e., about 0.80) correlations between residual noise in the Hanford and Livingston detectors in the chirp domain as previously seen by us [2] when using a numerical relativity template given in [3]. It was also shown in [1] that a so-called maximum likelihood template can reduce these statistically significant cross-correlations. Here, we demonstrate that the reduction of correlation and statistical significance is due to (i) the use of a peculiar template which is qualitatively different from the properties of GW150914 originally published by LIGO, (ii) a suspicious MCMC chain, (iii) uncertainties in the matching of the maximum likelihood (ML) template to the data in the Fourier domain, and (iv) a biased estimation of the significance that gives counter-intuitive results. We show that rematching the maximum likelihood template to the data in the 0.2\,s domain containing the GW150914 signal restores these correlations at the level of $60\%$ of those found in [1]. With necessary corrections, the probability given in [1] will decrease by more than one order of magnitude.

On Itokawa, the surface roughness reflects the results of down-slope activity that moves fine grained material into geopotential lows and leaves large blocks in geopotential highs. On 433 Eros, the surface roughness is controlled by geologically-recent large impact craters. In addition, large longitudinal spatial variations of surface roughness could impact the role of YORP on Itokawa.","Hannah C. M. Susorney, Catherine L. Johnson, Olivier S. Barnouin, Michael G.

735,"This is an introduction to Bayesian inference with a focus on hierarchical models and hyper-parameters. We write primarily for an audience of Bayesian novices, but we hope to provide useful insights for seasoned veterans as well. Examples are drawn from gravitational-wave astronomy, though we endeavor for the presentation to be understandable to a broader audience. We begin with a review of the fundamentals: likelihoods, priors, and posteriors. Next, we discuss Bayesian evidence, Bayes factors, odds ratios, and model selection. From there, we describe how posteriors are estimated using samplers such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and nested sampling. Finally, we generalize the formalism to discuss hyper-parameters and hierarchical models. We include extensive appendices discussing the creation of credible intervals, Gaussian noise, explicit marginalization, posterior predictive distributions, and selection effects.","Eric Thrane, Colm Talbot","16 pages, 3 figures",1809.02293v5,No journal ref found,Colm Talbot,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02293v5,2018-09-07 03:24:44+00:00,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.IM,"An introduction to Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy:   parameter estimation, model selection, and hierarchical models",2019-05-13 06:57:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02293v5
736,"With the hundreds of merging binary black hole (BH) signals expected to be detected by LIGO/Virgo, LISA and other instruments in the next few years, the modeling of astrophysical channels that lead to the formation of compact-object binaries has become of fundamental importance. In this paper, we carry out a systematic statistical study of quadruple BHs consisting of two binaries in orbit around their center of mass, by means of high-precision direct $N$-body simulations including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to 2.5PN order. We found that most merging systems have high initial inclinations and the distributions peak at $\sim 90^\circ$ as for triples, but with a more prominent broad distribution tail. We show that BHs merging through this channel have a significant eccentricity in the LIGO band, typically much larger than BHs merging in isolated binaries and in binaries ejected from star clusters, but comparable to that of merging binaries formed via the GW capture scenario in clusters, mergers in hierarchical triples, or BH binaries orbiting intermediate-mass black holes in star clusters. We show that the merger fraction can be up to $\sim 3$--$4\times$ higher for quadruples than for triples. Thus even if the number of quadruples is $20\%$--$25\%$ of the number of triples, the quadruple scenario can represent an important contribution to the events observed by LIGO/VIRGO.","Giacomo Fragione, Bence Kocsis","9 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted by MNRAS",1903.03112v3,No journal ref found,Bence Kocsis,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03112v3,2019-03-07 19:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.HE,Black hole mergers from quadruples,2019-05-13 06:43:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03112v3

The source star is a heavily extincted $A_I\sim 5.2$ luminous giant that has the lowest Galactic latitude, $b=-0.28^\circ$, of any planetary microlensing event. The relatively blue blended light is almost certainly either the host or its binary companion, with the first explanation being substantially more likely. This blend dominates the light at $I$ band and completely dominates at $R$ and $V$ bands. Hence, the lens system can be probed by follow-up observations immediately, i.e., long before the lens system and the source separate due to their relative proper motion. The system is well characterized despite the low cadence $\Gamma=0.15$--$0.20\,{\rm hr^{-1}}$ of observations and short viewing windows near the end of the bulge season. This suggests that optical microlensing planet searches can be extended to the Galactic plane at relatively modest cost.","Yoon-Hyun Ryu, Maria Gabriela Navarro, Andrew Gould, Michael D.

739,"The polarization of masers contains information on the magnetic field strength and direction of the regions they occur in. Many maser polarization observations have been performed over the last 30 years. However, versatile maser polarization models that can aide in the interpretation of these observations are not available. We aim to develop a program suite that can compute the polarization by a magnetic field of any non-paramagnetic maser specie at arbitrarily high maser saturation. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the polarization of masers by non-Zeeman polarizing effects. We aim to present a general interpretive structure for maser polarization observations. We expand existing maser polarization theories of non-paramagnetic molecules and incorporate these in a numerical modeling program suite. We present a modeling program that CHAracterizes Maser Polarization (CHAMP) that can examine the polarization of masers of arbitrarily high maser saturation and high angular momentum. Also, hyperfine multiplicity of the maser-transition can be incorporated. The user is able to investigate non-Zeeman polarizing mechanisms such as anisotropic pumping and polarized incident seed radiation. We present an analysis of the polarization of v = 1 SiO masers and the 22 GHz water maser. We comment on the underlying polarization mechanisms, and also investigate non-Zeeman effects. We identify the regimes where different polarizing mechanisms will be dominant and present the polarization characteristics of the SiO and water masers.

740,"We employ the hemisphere comparison (HC) method and the dipole fitting (DF) method to investigate the cosmic anisotropy in the recently released Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and five combinations among Pantheon. For the HC method, we find the maximum anisotropy level in the full Pantheon sample is $\mathrm{AL}_{max}=0.361\pm0.070$ and corresponding direction $(l,b)=({123.05^{\circ}}^{+11.25^{\circ}}_{-4.22^{\circ}}, {4.78^{\circ}}^{+1.80^{\circ}}_{-8.36^{\circ}})$. A robust check shows the statistical significance of maximum anisotropy level is about $2.1\sigma$. We also find that the Low-$z$ and SNLS subsamples have decisive impact on the overall anisotropy while other three subsamples have little impact. Moreover, the anisotropy level map significantly rely on the inhomogeneous distribution of SNe Ia in the sky. For the DF method, we find the dipole anisotropy in the Pantheon sample is very weak. The dipole magnitude is constrained to be less than $1.16\times10^{-3}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. However, the dipole direction is well inferred by MCMC method and it points towards $(l,b)=({306.00^{\circ}}^{+82.95^{\circ}}_{-125.01^{\circ}}, {-34.20^{\circ}}^{+16.82^{\circ}}_{-54.93^{\circ}})$. This direction is very close to the axial direction to the plane of SDSS subsample. It may imply that SDSS subsample is the decisive part to the dipole anisotropy in the full Pantheon sample. All these facts imply that the cosmic anisotropy found in Pantheon sample significantly rely on the inhomogeneous distribution of SNe Ia in the sky. More homogeneous distribution of SNe Ia is necessary to search for a more convincing cosmic anisotropy.","Dong Zhao, Yong Zhou, Zhe Chang","12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, MNRAS accepted",1903.12401v2,No journal ref found,Zhe Chang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12401v2,2019-03-29 08:58:53+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Anisotropy of the Universe via the Pantheon supernovae sample revisited,2019-05-13 04:33:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12401v2
741,"The structured jet is involved to explain the afterglows and even the prompt emission of GRB 170817A. In this paper, we stress that for a precessing jet, the jet structure in the prompt emission phase and that in the afterglow phase may be different. The jet structure in the afterglow phase can be non-uniform even if a narrow-uniform jet is presented in the prompt emission phase. We estimate the jet structure in the afterglow phase under the situation that a narrow-uniform-precessing jet is launched from the central engine of gamma-ray burst. With different precession angles, it is found that the structured jet can be roughly described as follows: a narrow uniform core with power-law wings and sharp cut-off edges, a Gaussian profile, a ring shape, or other complex profile in energy per solid angle. Correspondingly, the afterglows for our obtained structured jets are also estimated. We find that the estimates of the intrinsic kinetic energy, the electron index, and the jet opening angle based on the afterglows formed in a precessing system may be incorrect. Our obtained structured jet is likely to be revealed by future observations for a fraction of gravitational wave detected merging compact binary systems (e.g., black hole-neutron star mergers).","Bao-Quan Huang, Da-Bin Lin, Tong Liu, Jia Ren, Xiang-Gao Wang, Hong-Bang Liu, En-Wei Liang","7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS",1905.04851v1,No journal ref found,En-Wei Liang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04851v1,2019-05-13 04:01:25+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Jet Structure in the Afterglow Phase for Gamma-ray Bursts with a   Precessing Jet,2019-05-13 04:01:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04851v1
742,"As the plausible central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a black hole (BH) hyperaccretion disk should be in a state of neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) if the accretion rate is larger than the ignition rate of an NDAF. A rotating stellar-mass BH surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk might be born in the center of a massive core collapsar. In the initial hundreds of seconds of the accretion process, the mass supply rate of the massive progenitor is generally higher than the ignition accretion rate, but the jets are generally choked in the envelope. Thus, neutrinos can be emitted from the center of a core collapsar. In this paper, we study the effects of the masses and metallicities of progenitor stars on the time-integrated spectra of electron neutrinos from NDAFs. The peak energies of the calculated spectra are approximately 10-20 MeV. The mass of a collapsar has little influence on the neutrino spectrum, and a low metallicity is beneficial to the production of low-energy ($\lesssim$ 1 MeV) neutrinos. We also investigate the differences in the electron neutrino spectra between NDAFs and proto-neutron stars. Combining with the electromagnetic counterparts and multi-messenger astronomy, one may verify the possible remnants of the core collapse of massive stars with future neutrino detectors.","Yun-Feng Wei, Tong Liu, Cui-Ying Song","9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.04850v1,No journal ref found,Cui-Ying Song,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04850v1,2019-05-13 03:45:57+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Black hole hyperaccretion in collapsars.

743,"The Ultraviolet Luminosity Function (UVLF) is a key observable for understanding galaxy formation from cosmic dawn. There has been considerable debate on whether Schechter-like LFs (characterized by an exponential drop-off at the bright end) that well describe the LF in our local Universe are also a sufficient description of the LF at high redshifts ($z>6$). We model the UVLF over cosmic history with a semi-empirical framework and include a log-normal scatter, $\Sigma$, in galaxy luminosities with a conditional luminosity function approach. We show that stochasticity induces a flattening or a feedback scale in the median galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation, $L_{c}(M_{h})$ to account for the increase of bright objects placed in lower mass halos. We observe a natural broadening in the bright-end exponential segment of the UVLF for $z>6$ if processes that regulate star-formation acts on the same mass scale as at $z\sim5$, where the degree of broadening is enhanced for larger $\Sigma$. Alternatively, if the bright-end feedback is triggered at a near-constant luminosity threshold, the feedback threshold occurs at progressively lower halo masses with increasing redshift, due to galaxies being more luminous on average at a fixed halo mass from rapid halo assembly. Such feedback results in a LF shape with a bright-end closer to that of a Schechter function. We include predictions for the $z>8$ UVLFs from future all-sky surveys such as WFIRST which has the potential to both quantify the scatter and type of feedback, and provide insight behind the mechanisms that drive star formation in the early Universe.","Keven Ren, Michele Trenti, Charlotte A.

744,"The mass and spin distributions of compact binary gravitational-wave sources are currently uncertain due to complicated astrophysics involved in their formation. Multiple sub-populations of compact binaries representing different evolutionary scenarios may be present among sources detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. In addition to hierarchical modelling, unmodelled methods can aid in determining the number of sub-populations and their properties. In this paper, we apply Gaussian mixture model clustering to 1000 simulated gravitational-wave compact binary sources from a mixture of five sub-populations. Using both mass and spin as input parameters, we determine how many binary detections are needed to accurately determine the number of sub-populations and their mass and spin distributions. In the most difficult case that we consider, where two sub-populations have identical mass distributions but differ in their spin, which is poorly constrained by gravitational-wave detections, we find that ~ 400 detections are needed before we can identify the correct number of sub-populations.","Jade Powell, Simon Stevenson, Ilya Mandel, Peter Tino",No comment found,1905.04825v1,No journal ref found,Peter Tino,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04825v1,2019-05-13 01:48:19+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Unmodelled Clustering Methods for Gravitational Wave Populations of   Compact Binary Mergers,2019-05-13 01:48:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04825v1

High-excitation C~I lines are used to constrain 3D,NLTE corrections of G-band analyses.

The two leading theoretical models of GRBs and their afterglows, the fireball model and the cannonball model, have been widely confronted with the mounting observational data on GRBs and SHBs during the last two decades. Both have claimed success in reproducing the observational data, despite their complexity and diversity.

749,"Wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma (a 1D, strongly magnetized, pair plasma streaming highly relativistically with a large spread in Lorentz factors in its rest frame) is discussed, motivated by interest in beam-driven wave turbulence and the pulsar radio emission mechanism. In the rest frame of the pulsar plasma there are three wave modes in the low-frequency, non-gyrotropic approximation. For parallel propagation these are referred to as the X, A and L modes, with the X and A modes having dispersion relation $z=z_A\approx1-1/2\beta_A^2$, where $z=\omega/k_\parallel c$ is the phase speed and $\beta_Ac$ is the Alfven speed. The L mode dispersion relation is determined by a relativistic plasma dispersion function, $z^2W(z)$, which is negative for $ z < z_0 $ and has a sharp maximum at $z=z_m$, with $1-z_m<1-z_0\ll1$. We give numerical estimates for the maximum of $z^2W(z)$ and for $z_m$ and $z_0$ for a 1D Juttner distribution. The L and A modes reconnect, for $z_A>z_0$, to form the O and Alfven modes for oblique propagation ($\theta\neq0$). For $z_A<z_0$ the Alfven and O~mode curves reconnect forming a new mode that exists only for $\tan^2\theta>z_0^2-z_A^2$.   The L mode is the nearest counterpart to Langmuir waves in a nonrelativistic plasma, but we argue that there are no `Langmuir-like' waves in pulsar plasma, identifying three features of the L~mode (dispersion relation, ratio of electric to total energy and group speed) that are not Langmuir-like. A beam-driven instability requires a beam speed equal to the phase speed of the wave. This resonance condition can be satisfied for the O mode, but only for an implausibly energetic beam and only for a tiny range of angles for the O~mode around $\theta\approx0$. The resonance is also possible for the Alfven mode but only near a turnover frequency that has no counterpart for Alfven waves in a nonrelativistic plasma.","M. Z. Rafat, D. B. Melrose, A.

750,"A correspondence between the Equivalence principle and the homogeneity of the universe is discussed. We show that under the Newtonian gravity, translation of co-moving coordinates in a uniformly expanding universe defines a new accelerated frame. A consistency condition for the invariance of this transformation yields the second Friedman equation. All these symmetries are lost when we modify Newton's second law and/ or the Poisson equation. For example by replacing Newton's second law with non-linear function of the acceleration, as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) suggested, the concept of relative acceleration is lost. As a consequence the homogeneity of the universe breaks. Therefore MOND which changes Newton's second law or a QUAdratic Lagrangian (AQUAL) which changes the Poisson equation are not complete theories and they should be amended to preserve the cosmological principle. Only locally could MOND be used as a toy model, but not as a global theory which should describe a universe in large scales.","David Benisty, Eduardo I.

751,"With mass ratio larger than $\sim 5$, star disruption is not expected for a black hole merging with a neutron star during the final plunge phase. In the late inspiral stage, the black hole is likely charged as it cuts through the magnetic field carried by the neutron star, leaving a temporarily charged black hole after merger. The unstable charged state of the remnant black hole rapidly neutralizes by interacting with the surrounding plasma and photons, which we investigate in first principle by numerically solving a coupled set of Boltzmann equations. The resulting basic picture is as follows. Electrons and positrons are accelerated in the BH electric field, which then lose energy to surrounding soft photons via Compton scattering; more electrons and positrons will be created from pair production as the hard photons colliding with soft photons, or through the Schwinger process in strong electromagnetic fields. The cascade stops when the charged black hole accretes enough opposite charges and becomes neutralized. We find that $\sim 10\%$ (which depends on the soft photon energy and number density) of the total electric energy is carried away to infinity in a time interval $\sim 1$ ms by very-high-energy ($>50$ GeV, the low energy detection threshold of the MAGIC telescope) gamma rays whose spectrum is approximately a power law with spectral index $\sim -2.3$.","Zhen Pan, Huan Yang",No comment found,1905.04775v1,No journal ref found,Huan Yang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04775v1,2019-05-12 19:12:49+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|gr-qc,Black Hole Discharge: very-high-energy gamma rays from black   hole-neutron star mergers,2019-05-12 19:12:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04775v1

753,"How the supermassive black hole SgrA* in the Milky Way Center looks like for a distant observer? It depends on the black hole highlighting by the surrounding hot matter. The black hole shadow (the photon capture cross-section) would be viewed if there is a stationary luminous background. The black hole event horizon is invisible directly (per se). Nevertheless, a more compact (with respect to black hole shadow) projection of the black hole event horizon on the celestial sphere may be reconstructed by detecting the highly red-shifted photons emitted by the non-stationary luminous matter plunging into the black hole and approaching to the event horizon. It is appropriate to call this reconstructed projection of the event horizon on the celestial sphere for a distant observer as the ``lensed event horizon image'', or simply the ``event horizon image''. This event horizon image is placed on the celestial sphere within the position of black hole shadow. Amazingly, the event horizon image is a gravitationally lensed projection on the celestial sphere of the whole surface of the event horizon globe. In result, the black holes may be viewed at once from both the front and back sides. The lensed event horizon image may be considered as a genuine silhouette of the black hole. For example, a dark northern hemisphere of the event horizon image is the simplest model for a black hole silhouette in the presence of a thin accretion disk.",Vyacheslav Dokuchaev,"17 pages, 10 figures, new references added. arXiv admin note: text

We analyze three sources: 4U1608-52, 4U0614+09, and 4U1728-34. Our analysis shows that geodesic models based on pairs of high-frequency QPOs, identified with the azimuthal and periastron precession frequencies, provide consistent results. We discuss how observations of QPO doublets can be used to constrain the equation of state of neutron stars in a way complementary to other observations.

755,"We present high-fidelity, 30 milliarcsecond (200-pc) resolution ALMA rest-frame 240 $\mu$m observations of cold dust emission in three typical $z \sim 3$ star-forming galaxies in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF). The cold dust is distributed within the smooth disk-like central regions of star formation (SF) $1 - 3$ kpc in diameter, despite their complex and disturbed rest-frame UV and optical morphologies. No dust substructures or clumps are seen down to $\simeq 1- 3$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ (1$\sigma$) per 200-pc beam. No dust emission is observed at the locations of UV-emitting clumps, which lie $\simeq 2-10$ kpc from the bulk of SF. Clumpy substructures can contribute no more than $1-8$ % (3$\sigma$ upper limits) of the total SF in these galaxies. The lack of SF substructures in our HUDF galaxies is to be contrasted with the multiple substructures characteristic of submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same cosmic epoch, each containing $\sim 10-30$ % of their total SF. We find that individual substructures of SMGs are often as bright in the far-infrared as (or in some cases brighter than) our HUDF galaxies, suggesting that these SMGs originate from a class of disruptive event involving multiple objects at the scale of our HUDF galaxies. The scale of the disruptive event found in our HUDF galaxies, characterized by the lack of star-forming substructures at our resolution and sensitivity, could be less violent, e.g., gas-rich disk instability or minor mergers.","W.

757,"Despite its dominance, hydrogen has been largely ignored in studies of the abundance patterns of the chemical elements in gradual solar energetic-particle (SEP) events; those neglected abundances show a surprising new pattern of behavior. Abundance enhancements of elements with 2 <= Z <= 56, relative to coronal abundances, show a power-law dependence, versus their average mass-to-charge ratio A/Q, that varies from event to event and with time during events. The ion charge states Q depend upon the source plasma temperature T. For most gradual SEP events, shock waves have accelerated ambient coronal material with T < 2 MK with decreasing power-laws in A/Q. In this case, the proton abundances agree rather well with the power-law fits extrapolated from elements with Z >= 6 at A/Q > 2 down to hydrogen at A/Q = 1. Thus the abundances of the elements with Z >= 6 fairly accurately predict the observed abundance of H, at a similar velocity, in most SEP events. However, for those gradual SEP events where ion enhancements follow positive powers of A/Q, especially those with T > 2 MK where shock waves have reaccelerated residual suprathermal ions from previous impulsive SEP events, proton abundances commonly exceed the extrapolated expectation, usually by a factor of order ten. This is a new and unexpected pattern of behavior that is unique to the abundances of protons and may be related to the need for more streaming protons to produce sufficient waves for scattering and acceleration of more heavy ions at the shock.",Donald V.

758,"Our understanding of how molecular clouds form in the interstellar medium (ISM) would be greatly helped if we had a reliable observational tracer of the gas flows responsible for forming the clouds. Fine structure emission from singly ionised and neutral carbon ([CII], [CI]) and rotational line emission from CO are all observed to be associated with molecular clouds. However, it remains unclear whether any of these tracers can be used to study the inflow of gas onto an assembling cloud, or whether they primarily trace the cloud once it has already assembled. In this paper, we address this issue with the help of high resolution simulations of molecular cloud formation that include a sophisticated treatment of the chemistry and thermal physics of the ISM. Our simulations demonstrate that both [CI] and CO emission trace gas that is predominantly molecular, with a density n ~ 500-1000 cm$^{-3}$, much larger than the density of the inflowing gas. [CII] traces lower density material (n ~ 100 cm$^{-3}$) that is mainly atomic at early times. A large fraction of the [CII] emission traces the same structures as the [CI] or CO emission, but some arises in the inflowing gas. Unfortunately, this emission is very faint and will be difficult to detect with current observational facilities, even for clouds situated in regions with an elevated interstellar radiation field.","Paul C.

759,"The averaged resonant equations of motion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem are solved on the linearization basis taking into account also non-gravitational effects. The averaged resonant equations are derived from Lagrange's planetary equations with additional Gauss's terms caused by the non-gravitational effects. The time depending solution has the standard form with exponential, quadratic, linear and constant terms. The existence of a rotational symmetry in the action of the non-gravitational effects around the star determines the order of a characteristic equation of the linearized system. In the symmetrical case (order 3) the considered non-gravitational effects are the stellar electromagnetic radiation and the radial stellar wind (stellar radiation). In the asymmetrical case (order 4) the stellar radiation and interstellar gas flow are considered. It is investigated how well the linearization solution describes real solution obtained from an equation of motion by a comparison of the resonant libration frequency found analytically and numerically. It is found that from initial values of the evolving orbital parameters (semimajor axis, eccentricity, longitude of pericenter, and resonant angular variable) in the averaged phase space the linearization frequency depends most sensitively on the initial value of the resonant angular variable. For small libration amplitudes of the resonant angular variable the best match of the real libration frequency and the linearization frequency is located approximately at the solution of the resonant condition ($da / dt$ $=$ 0). If the initial averaged conditions are chosen close to the solution of resonant condition, then the linearization frequency for practically all simple oscillatory evolutions matches the real libration frequency and the linearization solution very well approximates the real evolution.",Pavol Pastor,"39 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",1506.09033v6,No journal ref found,Pavol Pastor,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.09033v6,2015-06-30 11:12:22+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Linearized averaged resonant equations and their solution for dust   particles,2019-05-12 13:59:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09033v6

761,"We present the first chemical evolution model for Enceladus, alias the Gaia Sausage, to investigate the star formation history of one of the most massive satellites accreted by the Milky Way during a major merger event. Our best chemical evolution model for Enceladus nicely fits the observed stellar [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance trends, and reproduces the observed stellar metallicity distribution function, by assuming low star formation efficiency, fast infall time scale, and mild outflow intensity. We predict a median age for Enceladus stars $12.33^{+0.92}_{-1.36}$ Gyr, and - at the time of the merger with our Galaxy ($\approx10$ Gyr ago from Helmi et al.) - we predict for Enceladus a total stellar mass $M_{\star} \approx 5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$. By looking at the predictions of our best model, we discuss that merger events between the Galaxy and systems like Enceladus may have inhibited the gas accretion onto the Galaxy disc at high redshifts, heating up the gas in the halo. This scenario could explain the extended period of quenching in the star formation activity of our Galaxy about 10 Gyr ago, which is predicted by Milky Way chemical evolution models, in order to reproduce the observed bimodality in [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] between thick- and thin-disc stars.","Fiorenzo Vincenzo, Emanuele Spitoni, Francesco Calura, Francesca Matteucci, Victor Silva Aguirre, Andrea Miglio, Gabriele Cescutti",Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters,1903.03465v2,No journal ref found,Gabriele Cescutti,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03465v2,2019-03-08 14:17:49+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,"The Fall of a Giant.

763,"We propose a multi-messenger probe of the natural parameter space of QCD axion dark matter based on observations of black hole-neutron star binary inspirals. It is suggested that a dense dark matter spike may grow around intermediate mass black holes. The presence of such a spike produces two unique effects: a distinct phase shift in the gravitational wave strain during the inspiraling period and an enhancement of the radio emission due to the resonant axion-photon conversion occurring in the neutron star magnetosphere. Remarkably, the observation of the gravitational wave signal can be used to infer the dark matter density and, consequently, to predict the radio emission. We study the projected sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling in the light of the LISA interferometer and next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array. Given a sufficiently nearby detection, such observations will explore the QCD axion in the mass range $10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}$.","Thomas D. P.

This leads to baryogenesis through leptogenesis with massive right-handed neutrinos. The generation of chiral matter after inflation helps in cancelling the anomalies in the observable radiation- and matter- dominated eras. The present era inherits the same ""running vacuum"" structure triggered during the inflationary time by the axion field.

Such a term is derived from the Covariant Canonical Gauge Theory of gravity (CCGG) incorporating Dirac fermions. We obtain an initial de Sitter phase followed by a successful exit, and moreover, we acquire the subsequent thermal history, with an effective matter era, followed finally by a dark-energy epoch. This behavior is a result of the effective `weakening' of gravity at early times, due to the decreased curvature-dependent fermion mass. Through the perturbation level, we obtain the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which are in agreement with the Planck observations. The efficiency of inflation from fermions with curvature-dependent mass, at both the background and perturbation level, reveals the capabilities of the scenario and makes it a good candidate for the description of nature.","David Benisty, Eduardo I.

The initial goal of the project is to carry out a ten year imaging survey in six broad passbands (ugrizy) that cover $350 nm < \lambda < 1.1 \mu m$. This document reports on the discussions that occurred at workshop (held April 11-12, 2019 at Argonne National Laboratory) that was convened to explore concepts for using the LSST system once the initial survey is complete. Participants discussed the tradeoffs in science performance, cost, and uniqueness for i) imaging surveys using the initial wide-field CCD instrument, perhaps supplemented with different filters, ii) replacing the focal plane with some alternative sensor technology, and iii) converting the LSST system to a wide-field multi-object fiber-fed spectrograph. Participants concluded that the fiber spectrograph option would be most effective if the focal plane were to feed upwards of 30,000 fibers. Thermal management and power considerations in the LSST instrument barrel make it difficult to accommodate infrared sensors that require very low operating temperatures, and the current generation of buttable IR sensors that would extend sensitivity to 2 $\mu$m are, we concluded, cost-prohibitive. Procuring and using an alternative filter set, on the other hand, is modest in cost, would take full advantage of the LSST image reduction pipeline, and could yield considerable additional information.","Christopher W.

This is the first analysis of its kind using 2-m class telescopes, and serves to highlight their potential. In this context, we then proceed to discuss the suitability of this class of telescopes for the upcoming flood of scientifically interesting targets from TESS space mission, and propose a methodology to select the most promising targets.

They set the stage for many subsequent, detailed studies by other groups. Intensive studies of individual multiplanet systems provided some of Kepler's most important exoplanet discoveries.

770,"We present the results of Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations made with AstroSat of the newly discovered black hole binary MAXI J1535-571. We detect prominent C-type Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies varying from 1.85 Hz to 2.88 Hz, along with distinct harmonics in all the AstroSat observations. We note that while the fundamental QPO is seen in the 3 - 50 keV energy band, the harmonic is not significant above ~ 35 keV. The AstroSat observations were made in the hard intermediate state, as seen from state transitions observed by MAXI and Swift. We attempt spectral modelling of the broadband data (0.7-80 keV) provided by AstroSat using phenomenological and physical models. The spectral modelling using nthComp gives a photon index in the range between 2.18-2.37 and electron temperature ranging from 21 to 63 keV. The seed photon temperature is within 0.19 to 0.29 keV. The high flux in 0.3 - 80 keV band corresponds to a luminosity varying from 0.7 to 1.07 L_Edd assuming the source to be at a distance of 8 kpc and hosting a black hole with a mass of 6 M$_{\odot}$. The physical model based on the two-component accretion flow gives disc accretion rates as high as ~ 1 $\dot{m}_{Edd}$ and halo rate ~ 0.2 $\dot{m}_{Edd}$ respectively. The near Eddington accretion rate seems to be the main reason for the unprecedented high flux observed from this source. The two-component spectral fitting of AstroSat data also provides an estimate of a black hole mass between 5.14 to 7.83 M$_{\odot}$.","Sreehari H., Ravishankar B. T., Nirmal Iyer, V. K.

771,"Accretion of tidally disrupted stars (TDSs) is expected to contribute significantly to the growth of massive black holes (MBHs) with mass $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ in galactic centers. In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the effect of the TDS accretion on the spin evolution of these relatively small MBHs, by also considering the accretion of gas-clouds with (many) chaotic episodes. We find that the accretion of TDSs can play an important role or even a dominant role in shaping the spin distribution of $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs, depending on the contribution fraction ($f_{\rm TDE}$) of the TDS accretion to the MBH growth. If $f_{\rm TDE}$ is as large as $\gtrsim 0.9$, most $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$ MBHs have low spins ($|a| \lesssim 0.3$); if $f_{\rm TDE}$ is as small as $\lesssim 0.1$, most $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs have high spins ($|a| \gtrsim 0.7$). We also find that (1) the fraction of highly spinning $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs in the TDS accretion states is smaller than that in the gas-cloud (AGN) accretion states, which is a consequence of more rapid spin decrease during the period of consecutive TDS accretion than the spin increase during the AGN periods when the spin is large; (2) the fraction of retrograde spin accretion in the TDS accretion states is almost the same as that of prograde spin accretion, while it is negligible in the gas-cloud (AGN) accretion states. Current scarce sample of AGNs ($\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$) with spin measurements hints an insignificant contribution from TDS accretion to MBH growth. Future measurements on spins of $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs may provide stronger constraints on the importance of both AGN and TDS accretion states in their growth history.","Xiaoxia Zhang, Youjun Lu, Zhu Liu","15pages, 8 figures, to appear in the Astrophysical Journal",1905.04637v1,No journal ref found,Zhu Liu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04637v1,2019-05-12 02:58:17+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.GA,Effect of accreting tidally disrupted stars on the spin evolution of   $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$ black holes,2019-05-12 02:58:17+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04637v1
772,"Exploring diverse planetary atmospheres requires modeling tools that are both accurate and flexible. Here, we develop a three-dimensional general circulation model (3D GCM) that for the first time uses a line-by-line approach to describe the radiative transfer. We validate our GCM by comparing with published results done by different 1D and 3D models. To demonstrate the versatility of the model, we apply the GCM to the hot Earth-sized exoplanet GJ 1132b and study its climate and circulation assuming an atmosphere dominated by abiotic oxygen (O$_2$). Our simulations show that a minor CO$_2$ composition can change the circulation pattern substantially, intensifying the equatorial superrotation in particular. Computation of the phase-resolved spectroscopy indicates that the vertical profile of the superrotating jet could be inferred in future spectro-photometric observations by the phase shift of the hotspot in the CO$_2$ principle absorption band centered at 667 cm$^{-1}$. We also show that atmospheric mass could potentially be constrained by the phase amplitude in the O$_2$ vibrational fundamental band for planets with O$_2$-rich atmospheres, although further experimental and/or theoretical O$_2$-O$_2$ collision-induced absorption data at high temperatures is needed to confirm this. More physical schemes such as moist dynamics will be implemented in the GCM in the future so that it can be used to tackle a wide variety of planetary climate problems.","Feng Ding, Robin D.

773,"Characterizing the dependence of the orbital architectures and formation environments on the eccentricity distribution of planets is vital for understanding planet formation. In this work, we perform statistical eccentricity studies of transiting exoplanets using transit durations measured via Kepler combined with precise and accurate stellar radii from the California-Kepler Survey and Gaia. Compared to previous works that characterized the eccentricity distribution from transit durations, our analysis benefits from both high precision stellar radii ($\sim$3%) and a large sample of $\sim$1000 planets. We observe that that systems with only a single observed transiting planet have a higher mean eccentricity ($\bar{e} \sim 0.21$) than systems with multiple transiting planets ($\bar{e} \sim 0.05$), in agreement with previous studies. We confirm the preference for high and low eccentricity subpopulations among the singly transiting systems. Finally, we show suggestive new evidence that high $e$ planets in the Kepler sample are preferentially found around high metallicity ([Fe/H] $>0$) stars. We conclude by discussing the implications on planetary formation theories.","Sean M. Mills, Andrew W. Howard, Erik A. Petigura, Benjamin J. Fulton, Howard Isaacson, Lauren M.

774,"Constraining the dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w_x(z)$, is one of the main issues of current and future cosmological surveys. In practice, this requires making assumptions about the evolution of $w_x$ with redshift $z$, which can be manifested in a choice of a specific parametric form where cosmological parameters play an important role in the observed cosmic acceleration. Since any attempt to constrain the EoS requires fixing some prior in one form or the other, settling a method to constrain cosmological parameters is of great importance. In this letter, we provide a straightforward approach to show how cosmological tests can be improved via a new parametric methodology based on cosmography. Our result obtained can set up a pipeline for current and future cosmological surveys.","Celia Escamilla-Rivera, Salvatore Capozziello",3 pages,1905.04602v1,No journal ref found,Salvatore Capozziello,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04602v1,2019-05-11 22:39:39+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO|hep-th,Unveiling the dark energy equation of state from cosmography,2019-05-11 22:39:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04602v1
775,"We have developed a new Bayesian method to correct the flux densities of astronomical sources. The hybrid method combines a simulated likelihood to model survey selection together with an analytic source-count-based prior. The simulated likelihood captures the effect of complicated selection methods, such as multi-frequency filtering or imposed restrictions on recovered sample properties (e.g., color cuts). Simulations are also able to capture unanticipated sources of uncertainty. In this way, the method enables a broader application of Bayesian techniques. Use of an analytic prior allows variation of assumed source count models without re-simulating the likelihood. We present the method along with a detailed description of an application to real survey data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.","Megan B. Gralla, Tobias A. Marriage",10 pages.

776,"We present a catalog of 510 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN, primarily blazars) and 287 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at $> 5 \sigma$ significance in frequency bands centered on 148 GHz (2 mm), 218 GHz (1.4 mm) and 277 GHz (1.1 mm), from a 480 square degrees strip centered at R.A. 00h on the celestial equator with additional 360 square degrees shallower auxiliary fields at other longitudes. The combination of the deepest available 218 GHz wide-field imaging, our 277 GHz data, and multi-band filtering yields the most sensitive wide-field millimeter-wave DSFG selection to date with rms noise level referenced to 218 GHz reaching below 2 mJy. We developed new techniques to remove Galactic contamination (including evidence for CO(2-1) line emission) from the extragalactic catalog, providing a catalog of 321 Galactic sources in addition to the extragalactic catalog. We employ a new flux debiasing method that accounts for the heterogeneous sample selection in the presence of Galactic cuts. We present the spectral properties and source counts of the AGN and DSFGs. The DSFG spectra depart from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime of an optically thin modified blackbody between 218 GHz and 277 GHz, consistent with optically thick emission. For AGN with 148 and 218 GHz flux density > 50 mJy, we estimate the inter-year RMS fractional deviation in flux density due to source variability to be 40%. We provide source counts for AGN in the range 8$-$2870 mJy and for DSFGs in the range 8$-$90 mJy. Our DSFG counts probe both the brighter, lensed population and the fainter, unlensed population. At 277 GHz we report the first measurements of source counts at these flux densities, finding an excess above most model count predictions. Finally, we present thirty of the brightest DSFGs selected for multi-frequency study as candidate high-z lensed systems. (Abridged)","Megan B. Gralla, Tobias A. Marriage, Graeme Addison, Andrew J.

777,"It is necessary to make assumptions in order to derive models to be used for cosmological predictions and comparison with observational data. In particular, in standard cosmology the spatial curvature is assumed to be constant and zero (or at least very small). But there is, as yet, no fully independent constraint with an appropriate accuracy that gaurentees a value for the magnitude of the effective normalized spatial curvature $\Omega_{k}$ of less than approximately $0.01$. Moreover, a small non-zero measurement of $\Omega_{k}$ at such a level perhaps indicates that the assumptions in the standard model are not satisfied. It has also been increasingly emphasised that spatial curvature is, in general, evolving in relativistic cosmological models. We review the current situation, and conclude that the possibility of such a non-zero value of $\Omega_k$ should be taken seriously.",A. A.

779,"Contopoulos 2019 proposed that a dissipation zone develops in the magnetosphere of young pulsars at the edge of the closed-line region beyond the light cylinder. This is necessary in order to supply the charge carriers that will establish current closure through the equatorial and separatrix current-sheets. In the present work, we propose to investigate in greater detail this region with a simplified model that we would like to call the `ring-of-fire'. According to this simple model, the dissipation zone is a narrow reconnection layer where electrons and positrons are accelerated inwards and outwards respectively along Speiser orbits that are deflected in the azimuthal direction by the pulsar rotation. After they exit the reconnection layer, the accelerated positrons form the positively charged equatorial current-sheet, and the accelerated electrons form the negatively charged separatrix current-sheet along the boundary of the closed-line region. During their acceleration, particles lose only a small part of their energy to radiation. Most of their energy is lost outside the dissipation region, in the equatorial and separatrix current sheets. Our simple model allows us to obtain high-energy spectra and efficiencies. The radiation emitted by the positrons in the equatorial current-sheet forms a very-high energy tail that extends up to the TeV range.","Ioannis Contopoulos, Petros Stefanou","9 pages, 6 figures, Monthly Notices",1903.08501v2,No journal ref found,Petros Stefanou,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08501v2,2019-03-20 13:28:23+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,A ring-of-fire in the pulsar magnetosphere,2019-05-11 18:22:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08501v2
780,"We study the dynamical behaviour of the galactic black hole source GX 339-4 during 2002-2011 outbursts using RXTE, Swift(XRT), XMM-Newton(PN) archival data. We present the spectral evolution of the source using four outbursts data and discuss their similarities/differences between outbursts. We infer that the second peak in 2002/03 and 2004/05 outbursts can be due to a second instant of triggered instability in the accretion disc due to irradiation from the central X-ray source after peak-I. This propagates in viscous time scale and takes ~80-90 days after peak-I to produce peak-II. This unifies all four outbursts having a long rising time of ~90 days. The dynamical evolution of accretion parameters have been studied by modeling the individual observed spectrum with two-component accretion disc model where a Keplerian accretion disc produces the soft photons and the hard part of the spectrum originates from a hot sub-Keplerian central corona. A generic mathematical model has been proposed to understand the evolution of accretion parameters for sources like GX 339-4 which have longer rising time. Also, the possible differences of physical scenario for outbursts with shorter rising time are also discussed.","U. Aneesha, S. Mandal, H.

781,"We present The Payne, a general method for the precise and simultaneous determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra, based on fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances) simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the radiative transport are consistently calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000) for 25 labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a spectral flux prediction good to $10^{-3}$ rms across a wide range of $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g (including dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 element abundances that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14 values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the first time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress towards optimal modelling of survey spectra; and it leads to both precise and accurate estimates of stellar labels, based on physical models and without re-calibration.

782,"Supernova remnants (SNRs) that contain pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are characterized by distinct evolutionary stages. In very young systems, the PWN drives a shock into the innermost supernova (SN) material, giving rise to low-excitation lines and an infrared (IR) continuum from heated dust grains. These observational signatures make it possible to cleanly measure the properties of the deepest SN ejecta layers that can, in turn, provide constraints on the SN progenitor. We present Herschel Space Observatory far-IR observations of the PWN in the Galactic SNR Kes 75, containing the youngest known pulsar that exhibited magnetar-like activity. We detect highly-broadened oxygen and carbon line emission that arises from the SN ejecta encountered by the PWN. We also detect a small amount (a few thousandths of a solar mass) of shock-heated dust that spatially coincides with the ejecta material and was likely formed in the SN explosion. We use hydrodynamical models to simulate the evolution of Kes 75 and find that the PWN has so far swept up 0.05-0.1 solar masses of SN ejecta. Using explosion and nucleosynthesis models for different progenitor masses in combination with shock models, we compare the predicted far-IR emission with the observed line intensities and find that lower mass and explosion energy SN progenitors with mildly mixed ejecta profiles and comparable abundance fractions of carbon and oxygen are favored over higher mass ones. We conclude that Kes 75 likely resulted from an 8-12 solar-mass progenitor, providing further evidence that lower energy explosions of such progenitors can give rise to magnetars.","Tea Temim, Patrick Slane, Tuguldur Sukhbold, Bon-Chul Koo, John C.

784,"We investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) towards seven TeV gamma-ray sources thought to be pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) using Mopra molecular line observations at 7mm [CS(1-0), SiO(1-0,v=0)], Nanten CO(1-0) data and the SGPS/GASS HI survey. We have discovered several dense molecular clouds co-located to these TeV gamma-ray sources , which allows us to search for cosmic-rays (CRs) coming from progenitor SNRs or, potentially, from PWNe. We notably found SiO(1-0,v=0) emission towards HESS J1809-193, highlighting possible interaction between the adjacent supernova remnant SNR G011.0-0.0 and the molecular cloud at d $\sim$ 3.7 kpc. Using morphological features, and comparative studies of our column densities with those obtained from X-ray measurements, we claim a distance d $\sim$ 8.6 - 9.7 kpc for SNR G292.2-00.5, d $\sim$ 3.5 - 5.6 kpc for PSR J1418-6058 and d $\sim$ 1.5 kpc for the new SNR candidate found towards HESS J1303-631. From our mass and density estimates of selected molecular clouds, we discuss signatures of hadronic/leptonic components from PWNe and their progenitor SNRs. Interestingly, the molecular gas, which overlaps HESS J1026-582 at d $\sim$ 5 kpc, may support a hadronic origin. We find however that this scenario requires an undetected cosmic-ray accelerator to be located at d $\lt$ 10 pc from the molecular cloud. For HESS J1809-193, the cosmic-rays which have escaped SNR G011.0-0.0 could contribute to the TeV gamma-ray emission. Finally, from the hypothesis that at most 20% the pulsar spin down power could be converted into CRs, we find that, among the studied PWNe, only those from PSR J1809-1917 could potentially contribute to the TeV emission.","F.

785,"We re-examine unitarity bounds on the annihilation cross section of thermal-WIMP dark matter. For high-mass pointlike dark matter, it is generic to form WIMP bound states, which, together with Sommerfeld enhancement, affects the relic abundance. We show that these effects lower the unitarity bound from 139 TeV to below 100 TeV for non-self-conjugate dark matter and from 195 TeV (the oft-quoted value of 340 TeV assumes $\Omega_{DM} h^2 = 1$) to 140 TeV for the self-conjugate case. For composite dark matter, for which the unitarity limit on the radius was thought to be mass-independent, we show that the largest allowed mass is 1 PeV. In addition, we find important new effects for annihilation in the late universe. For example, while the production of high-energy light fermions in WIMP annihilation is suppressed by helicity, we show that bound-state formation changes this. Coupled with rapidly improving experimental sensitivity to TeV-range gamma rays, cosmic rays, and neutrinos, our results give new hope to attack the thermal-WIMP mass range from the high-mass end.","Juri Smirnov, John F.

786,"We bring forward a generalized pressure dark energy (GPDE) model to explore the evolution of the universe. This model has covered three common pressure parameterization types and can be reconstructed as quintessence and phantom scalar fields, respectively. We adopt the cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets to constrain the parameters. The results show that the inferred late-universe parameters of the GPDE model are (within $1\sigma$): The present value of Hubble constant $H_{0}=(72.30^{+1.26}_{-1.37})$km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$; Matter density parameter $\Omega_{\text{m0}}=0.302^{+0.046}_{-0.047}$, and the universe bias towards quintessence. While when we combine CC data and the $H_0$ data from Planck, the constraint implies that our model matches the $\Lambda$CDM model nicely. Then we perform dynamic analysis on the GPDE model and find that there is an attractor or a saddle point in the system corresponding to the different values of parameters. Finally, we discuss the ultimate fate of the universe under the phantom scenario in the GPDE model. It is demonstrated that three cases of pseudo rip, little rip, and big rip are all possible.","Jun-Chao Wang, Xin-He Meng","11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables",1905.04514v1,No journal ref found,Xin-He Meng,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04514v1,2019-05-11 12:33:30+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Exploring the deviation of cosmological constant by a generalized   pressure dark energy model,2019-05-11 12:33:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04514v1
787,"Following the historical observations of GW170817 and its multi-wavelength afterglow, more radio afterglows from neutron star mergers are expected in the future as counterparts to gravitational wave inspiral signals. We wish to describe these events using our current knowledge of the intrinsic population of neutron star mergers coming from gamma-ray burst science, and taking into account the sensitivities of current and future gravitational wave and radio detectors. This is done by coupling a semi-analytical model for the jet-dominated radio afterglow from a neutron star merger, an analytical simplified model for the gravitational wave signal from such events, and a population model prescribing the energetics, external density and other relevant parameters of the mergers. We report the expected distributions of observables (distance, orientation, afterglow peak time and flux, etc.) from future events and study how these can be used to further probe the population of binary neutron stars, their mergers and related outflows during future observing campaigns. In the case of the O3 run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, the radio afterglow of one third of gravitational-wave-detected mergers should be detectable--and detected if the source is localized thanks to the kilonova counterpart--by the Very Large Array, and these events should have viewing angles similar to that of GW170817. These findings confirm the radio afterglow as a powerful insight on these events, though some key afterglow-related techniques--such as Very Long Base Interferometry imaging of the merger remnant--may no longer be possible as the gravitational wave horizon increases.","RaphaÃ«l Duque, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Daigne, Robert Mochkovitch","13 pages, 9 figures, to be submitted to A&A",1905.04495v1,No journal ref found,Robert Mochkovitch,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04495v1,2019-05-11 10:26:57+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Predictions for radio afterglows of binary neutron star mergers: a   population study for O3 and beyond,2019-05-11 10:26:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04495v1

This is the first time ever that an impact flash is unambiguously recorded during a lunar eclipse and discussed in the scientific literature, and the first time that lunar impact flash observations in more than two wavelengths are reported. The impact event was observed by different instruments in the framework of the MIDAS survey. It was also spotted by casual observers that were taking images of the eclipse. The flash lasted 0.28 seconds and its peak luminosity in visible band was equivalent to the brightness of a mag. 4.2 star. The projectile hit the Moon at the coordinates 29.2 +- 0.3 $^{\circ}$S, 67.5 +- 0.4 $^{\circ}$W. In this work we have investigated the most likely source of the projectile, and the diameter of the new crater generated by the collision has been calculated.

789,"Globular clusters (GC) are important objects for tracing the early evolution of a galaxy. We study the relation between the properties of globular cluster systems - as quantified by the GC specific frequency (SN) - and the properties of their host galaxies. In order to understand the origin of the relation between the GC specific frequency (SN) and galaxy mass, we devise a theoretical model for the specific frequency (SN,th). GC erosion is considered to be an important aspect for shaping this relation, since observations show that galaxies with low densities have a higher SN, while high density galaxies have a small SN. We construct a model based on the hypothesis that star-formation is clustered and depends on the minimum embedded star cluster mass (Mecl,min), the slope of the power-law embedded cluster mass function (beta) and the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the maximum star cluster mass (Mecl,max). We find an agreement between the primordial value of the specific frequency (SNi) and our model for beta between 1.5 and 2.5 with Mecl,min <10^4 Msun.","Ahmed H.

790,"In high-energy astronomical phenomena, the stochastic particle acceleration by turbulences is one of the promising processes to generate non-thermal particles. In this paper, we investigate the energy-diffusion efficiency of relativistic particles in a temporally evolving wave ensemble that consists of a single mode (Alfv\'en, fast or slow) of linear magnetohydrodynamic waves. In addition to the gyroresonance with waves, the transit-time damping (TTD) also contributes to the energy-diffusion for fast and slow-mode waves. While the resonance condition with the TTD has been considered to be fulfilled by a very small fraction of particles, our simulations show that a significant fraction of particles are in the TTD resonance owing to the resonance broadening by the mirror force, which non-resonantly diffuses the pitch angle of particles. When the cutoff scale in the turbulence spectrum is smaller than the Larmor radius of a particle, the gyroresonance is the main acceleration mechanism for all the three wave modes. For the fast-mode, the coexistence of the gyroresonance and TTD resonance leads to anomalous energy-diffusion. For a particle with its Larmor radius smaller than the cutoff scale, the gyroresonance is negligible, and the TTD becomes the dominant mechanism to diffuse its energy. The energy-diffusion by the TTD-only resonance with fast-mode waves agrees with the hard-sphere-like acceleration suggested in some high-energy astronomical phenomena.","Yuto Teraki, Katsuaki Asano","12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1904.08579v2,No journal ref found,Katsuaki Asano,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08579v2,2019-04-18 03:12:56+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|physics.plasm-ph,Particle Energy Diffusion in Linear Magnetohydrodynamic Waves,2019-05-11 08:41:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08579v2

In this scenario, primordial black holes can comprise only part of the entire dark matter, say, of order 0.1 \%. This implies that the most of the dark matter is accounted for by a different component, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. We point out that in this situation, very compact dark matter minihalos, composed of the dominant component of the dark matter, are likely to be formed abundantly in the early Universe, with their formation redshift and abundance depending on primordial non-Gaussianity. They may be detected in future experiments via pulsar observations.","Tomohiro Nakama, Kazunori Kohri, Joseph Silk","9 pages, 2 figures",1905.04477v1,No journal ref found,Joseph Silk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04477v1,2019-05-11 08:17:18+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Ultracompact minihalos associated with stellar-mass primordial black   holes,2019-05-11 08:17:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04477v1
792,"Low sonic Mach number shocks form in the intracluster medium (ICM) during the formation of the large scale structure of the universe. Although observational evidence for $\gamma$-ray emission of hadronic origin from galaxy clusters has yet to be established, nonthermal cosmic ray (CR) protons are expected to be accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in those ICM shocks. Considering the results obtained from plasma simulations, we propose an analytic model that emulates the energy spectrum of CR protons accelerated in weak quasi-parallel ($Q_\parallel$) shocks in the test-particle regime. The transition from the postshock thermal to CR spectra occurs at the injection momentum, $p_{\rm inj}$, above which protons can undergo the full DSA process. While a fraction of the shock energy is transferred to CR protons during DSA, the gas thermal energy should decrease accordingly, and hence the postshock thermal distribution is expected to shift to lower temperatures. In our model the CR spectrum is anchored to the self-consistent, postshock thermal distribution at $p_{\rm inj}$. With this spectrum, the CR acceleration efficiency ranges $\eta\sim10^{-3}-0.02$ for supercritical, $Q_\parallel$ ICM shocks with sonic Mach number $2.25\lesssim M_{\rm s}\lesssim5$. Based on Ha et al (2018), on the other hand, we argue that proton acceleration would be negligible in subcritical shocks with $M_{\rm s}<2.25$.","Dongsu Ryu, Hyesung Kang, Ji-Hoon Ha",submitted to ApJ Lett,1905.04476v1,No journal ref found,Ji-Hoon Ha,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04476v1,2019-05-11 08:14:41+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,A Diffusive Shock Acceleration Model for Protons in Weak Quasi-parallel   Intracluster Shocks,2019-05-11 08:14:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04476v1

796,"Kepler-9, discovered by Holman et al. 2010, was the first system with multiple confirmed transiting planets and the first system to clearly show long-anticipated transit timing variations (TTVs). We review the historical circumstances behind the discovery and characterization of these planets and the publication of Holman et al. 2010. It was the first major novel exoplanet discovery of the Kepler Space Telescope mission. The Kepler pipeline identified two Saturn-radius candidates (called Kepler Objects of Interest or KOIs): KOI-377.01 with a 19-day period and KOI-377.02 with a 39-day period. Even with only 9 transits for KOI-377.01 and 6 of KOI-377.02, the transit times were completely inconsistent with a linear ephemeris and showed strongly anti-correlated variations in transit times. Holman et al. 2010 were able to readily show that these objects were planetary mass, confirming them as bona fide planets Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. As a multi-transiting system exhibiting strong TTVs, the relative planetary properties (e.g., mass ratio, radius ratio) were strongly constrained, opening a new chapter in comparative planetology. KOI-377.03, a small planet with a 1.5-day period, was not initially discovered by the Kepler pipeline, but was identified during the analysis of the other planets and was later confirmed as Kepler-9d through the BLENDER technique by Torres et al. 2011. Holman et al. 2010 included significant dynamical analysis to characterize Kepler-9's particular TTVs: planets near resonance show large amplitude anti-correlated TTVs with a period corresponding to the rotation of the line of conjunctions and an additional ""chopping"" signal due to the changing positions of the planets. We also review the updated properties of this system and propose ideas for future investigations.","Darin Ragozzine, Matthew J.

797,"Recent simulations show the \signal to be inherently non-Gaussian whereby the error covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}_{ij}$ of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) contains a trispectrum contribution which would be absent if the signal were Gaussian. Using the binned power spectrum and trispectrum from simulations, here we present a methodology for incorporating these with the baseline distribution and system noise to make error predictions for observations with any radio-interferometric array. Here we consider the upcoming SKA-Low. Non-Gaussianity enhances the errors introducing a positive deviation $\Delta$ relative to the Gaussian predictions. $\Delta$ increases with observation time $t_{\rm obs}$ and saturates as the errors approach the cosmic variance. Considering $t_{\rm obs}=1,024$ hrs where a $5 \sigma$ detection is possible at all redshifts $7 \le z \le 13$, in the absence of foregrounds we find that the deviations are important at small $k$ where we have $\Delta \sim 40-100 \%$ at $k \sim 0.04 ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for some of the redshifts and also at intermediate $k \, (\sim 0.4 ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ where we have $\Delta \sim 200 \%$ at $z=7$. Non-Gaussianity also introduces correlations between the errors in different $k$ bins, and we find both correlations and anti-correlations with the correlation coefficient value spanning $-0.4 \le r_{ij} \le 0.8$. Incorporating the foreground wedge, $\Delta$ continues to be important ($> 50 \%$) at $z=7$. We conclude that non-Gaussianity makes a significant contribution to the errors and this is important in the context of the future instruments which aim to achieve high sensitivity measurements of the EoR 21-cm PS.","Abinash Kumar Shaw, Somnath Bharadwaj, Rajesh Mondal","15 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome",1902.08706v2,No journal ref found,Rajesh Mondal,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08706v2,2019-02-22 23:58:20+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,The impact of non-Gaussianity on the error covariance for observations   of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm power spectrum,2019-05-11 02:37:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08706v2

We consider two corotating or counter-rotating vortices localized at the center of the photospheric plate, and additionally more corotating vortices that fill the plate entirely. Our investigation is specifically devoted to study the fully nonlinear stage, after the linear stage during which the vortices create laminar and smoothly twisting flux tubes. Our main goal is to understand the dynamics of photospheric vortices twisting the field lines of a coronal magnetic field permeated by finite amplitude broadband fluctuations. We find that depending on the arrangement and handedness of the photospheric vortices an inverse cascade storing a significant amount of magnetic energy may occur or not. In the first case a reservoir of magnetic energy available to large events such as destabilization of a pre-CME configuration develops, while in the second case the outcome is a turbulent heated corona.

799,"Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by shape noise, the variance in the unknown pre-lensing orientations of the source galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with a well-ordered velocity field, however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference of the shear, inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the Fisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in the idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component, $\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$ is the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing enclosing 80% of the light. The other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is degenerate with the magnification $\mu$ but with a loose prior ($\sigma_\mu=1$) it can reach $0.009\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm pix}}$. These constraints, however, degrade quickly at higher inclinations. We show that in general these constraints apply not to the shear components themselves but to two eigenvectors in the $(\gamma_\times,\gamma_+,\mu)$ space, with the third (usually $\mu$-like) eigenvector nearly unconstrained. We also forecast the potential of less expensive partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our idealized model, which may present barriers to practical implementation.","David Wittman, Matthew Self","14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ",1905.04404v1,No journal ref found,Matthew Self,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04404v1,2019-05-10 23:42:44+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|astro-ph.IM,Precision Weak Gravitational Lensing Using Velocity Fields: Fisher   Matrix Analysis,2019-05-10 23:42:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04404v1

The specific approach outlined in this paper consists of defining auxiliary variables that are related to the Bethe-Ansatz parameters, thereby transforming the Bethe-Ansatz equations into a different set of equations that are numerically better behaved and more tractable.

801,"Radius inflation continues to be explored as a peculiar occurrence among magnetically active, low-mass stars. Recently Somers et. al. 2017 showed that radius inflation among low-mass stars in the young open cluster M45 (Pleiades Cluster) is correlated to the rotation rate: faster rotators are more inflated. Here we extend that work to a sample of 68 stars of the older open Hyades Cluster. We derive the stars' spectral energy distributions to measure their bolometric fluxes. With spectroscopically defined $T_{\rm eff}$ and {\it Gaia\/} distances we calculate stellar radii using the Stefan-Boltzmann relation. We find numerous stars that exhibit significant (3-4$\sigma$) radius inflation relative to a nominal cluster isochrone. We compare these results to that of the younger Pleiades and consider radius inflation as a function of open cluster evolution. We find that unlike the Pleiades, there is not a statistically significant correlation between radius inflation and stellar rotation period. However, we do find that most inflated stars have (rapid) rotational Rossby numbers of 0.1--0.2, such that the correlation of radius inflation with Rossby number is statistically significant at 99.98\% confidence. Since the canonical rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars is understood to result from the connection between magnetic activity and surface convection, our results imply that magnetic activity within the convective layers of low-mass stars is what preferentially drives radius inflation","Karl Jaehnig, Garrett Somers, Keivan Stassun","13 Pages, 9 Figures, 2 Tables",1811.06561v3,No journal ref found,Keivan Stassun,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06561v3,2018-11-15 19:05:28+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Radius Inflation at Low Rossby Number in the Hyades Cluster,2019-05-10 21:14:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06561v3
802,"We present a seven-minute long $4\pi$-3D simulation of a shell merger event in a non-rotating $18.88\, \text{M}_{\odot}$ supernova progenitor before the onset of gravitational collapse. The key motivation is to capture the large-scale mixing and asymmetries in the wake of the shell merger before collapse using a self-consistent approach. The $4\pi$ geometry is crucial as it allows us to follow the growth and evolution of convective modes on the largest possible scales. We find significant differences between the kinematic, thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the 3D and the 1D model. The 3D model shows vigorous convection leading to more efficient mixing of nuclear species. In the 3D case the entire oxygen shell attains convective Mach numbers of $\mathord{\approx}\, 0.1$, whereas in the 1D model, the convective velocities are much lower and there is negligible overshooting across convective boundaries. In the 3D case, the convective eddies entrain nuclear species from the neon (and carbon) layers into the deeper part of the oxygen burning shell, where they burn and power a violent convection phase with outflows. This is a prototypical model of a convective-reactive system. Due to the strong convection and the resulting efficient mixing, the interface between the neon layer and the silicon-enriched oxygen layer disappears during the evolution, and silicon is mixed far out into merged oxygen/neon shell. Neon entrained inwards by convective downdrafts burns, resulting in lower neon mass in the 3D model compared to the 1D model at time of collapse. In addition, the 3D model develops remarkable large-scale, large-amplitude asymmetries, which may have important implications for the impending gravitational collapse and the subsequent explosion.","Naveen Yadav, Bernhard~MÃ¼ller, Hans Thomas Janka, Tobias Melson, Alexander Heger","20 pages, 15 figure, submitted to ApJ",1905.04378v1,No journal ref found,Alexander Heger,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04378v1,2019-05-10 20:41:25+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Large-Scale Mixing in a Violent Oxygen-Neon Shell Merger Prior to a   Core-Collapse Supernova,2019-05-10 20:41:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04378v1
803,"In September 2017, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory recorded a very-high-energy neutrino in directional coincidence with a blazar in an unusually bright gamma-ray state, TXS0506+056. Blazars are prominent photon sources in the universe because they harbor a relativistic jet whose radiation is strongly collimated and amplified. High-energy atomic nuclei known as cosmic rays can produce neutrinos; thus the recent detection may help identifying the sources of the diffuse neutrino flux and the energetic cosmic rays. Here we report on a self-consistent analysis of the physical relation between the observed neutrino and the blazar, in particular the time evolution and spectral behavior of neutrino and photon emission. We demonstrate that a moderate enhancement in the number of cosmic rays during the flare can yield a very strong increase of the neutrino flux which is limited by co-produced hard X-rays and TeV gamma rays. We also test typical radiation models for compatibility and identify several model classes as incompatible with the observations. We investigate to what degree the findings can be generalized to the entire population of blazars, to determine the relation between their output in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, and suggest how to optimize the strategy of future observations.","Shan Gao, Anatoli Fedynitch, Walter Winter, Martin Pohl","The published version is available from Nature Astronomy, open read

804,"As part of the Swift/UVOT Stars Survey, we present near-ultraviolet point-source photometry for 103 Galactic open clusters. These data, taken over the span of the mission, provide a unique and unprecedented set of near-ultraviolet point-source photometry on simple stellar populations. After applying membership analysis fueled mostly by GAIA DR2 proper motions, we find that 49 of these 103 have clear precise CMDs amenable to investigation. We compare the CMDs to theoretical isochrones and find good agreement between the theoretical isochrones and the CMDs. The exceptions are the fainter parts of the main sequence and the red giant branch in the uvw2-uvw1 CMDs, which is most likely due either to the difficulty of correcting for the red leak in the uvw2 filter or limitations in our understanding of UV opacities for cool stars. For the most part, our derived cluster parameters -- age, distance and reddening -- agree with the consensus literature but we find a few clusters that warrant substantial revision from literature values, notably NGC~2304, NGC~2343, NGC~2360, NGC~2396, NGC~2428, NGC~2509, NGC~2533, NGC~2571, NGC~2818, Collinder~220 and NGC~6939. A number of clusters also show white dwarf and blue straggler sequences. We confirm the presence of extended main sequence turnoffs in NGC~2360 and NGC~2818 and show hints of it in a number of other clusters which may warrant future spectroscopic study. Most of the clusters in the study have low extinction and the rest are well fit by a ""Milky-Way-like"" extinction law. However, Collinder~220 hints at a possible ""LMC-like"" extinction law.

It is important to investigate properties of perturbations in these models and go beyond the smooth FRLW cosmology. This allows us to distinguish different dark energy models with the same expansion history. For this, one often needs the potential for a particular expansion history. We study how such potentials can be reconstructed obtaining closed formulae for potential or reducing the problem to quadrature. We consider three classes of models here: tachyons, quintessence, and, interacting dark energy. We present results for constant w and the CPL parameterization.

Particular profiles of density function $\psi=\ln \bar{n}$ (where $\bar{n}$ is normalized by some constant density $N_0$) and temperatures $T_j$ (for $j=e,i)$ are chosen which reduce the set of nonlinear partial differential equations to two simple linear equations generating longitudinally uniform axial outflow and magnetic field in cylindrical geometry in several astrophysical objects. This mechanism also seems to be operative for producing short scale plasma jets in the solar atmosphere in the form of spicules and flares.

807,"Large scale simulations are a key pillar of modern research and require ever increasing computational resources. Different novel manycore architectures have emerged in recent years on the way towards the exascale era. Performance portability is required to prevent repeated non-trivial refactoring of a code for different architectures. We combine Athena++, an existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) CPU code, with Kokkos, a performance portable on-node parallel programming paradigm, into K-Athena to allow efficient simulations on multiple architectures using a single codebase. We present profiling and scaling results for different platforms including Intel Skylake CPUs, Intel Xeon Phis, and NVIDIA GPUs. K-Athena achieves $>10^8$ cell-updates/s on a single V100 GPU for second-order double precision MHD calculations, and a speedup of 30 on up to 24,576 GPUs on Summit (compared to 172,032 CPU cores), reaching $1.94\times10^{12}$ total cell-updates/s at 76% parallel efficiency. Using a roofline analysis we demonstrate that the overall performance is currently limited by DRAM bandwidth and calculate a performance portability metric of 83.1%. Finally, we present the strategies used for implementation and the challenges encountered maximizing performance.

The baryonic component is modelled as an axisymmetric exponential disk and its characteristics are derived from the surface luminosity profile of the galaxies. The purely baryonic fit is unsatisfactory, hence a dark matter component is clearly needed. The rotational curves of five galaxies could be explained with high confidence level by the BEC model. For these galaxies, we derive: (i) upper limits for the allowed graviton mass; and (ii) constraints on a velocity-type and a density-type quantity characterizing the BEC, both being expressed in terms of the BEC particle mass, scattering length and chemical potential. The upper limit for the graviton mass is of the order of $10^{-26}$ $\text{eV/c}^2$, three orders of magnitude stronger than the limit derived from recent gravitational wave detections.","Emma Kun, ZoltÃ¡n Keresztes, Saurya Das, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Ã.

809,"In terms of scientific output, the best way to study solar system bodies is sending spacecraft to make in-situ measurements or to observe at close distance. Probably, the second best means to learn about important physical properties of solar system objects is through stellar occultations. By combining occultation observations from several sites, size and shape can be derived with kilometric accuracy. Also, atmospheric properties can be derived if the body has an atmosphere. Furthermore, the technique can detect rings and even satellites (although rarely) around the main body. Except for the very special cases of Pluto and Charon, stellar occultations by Transneptunian Objects (TNOs) had never been observed until October 2009. This was because the ephemeris of the TNOs have much larger uncertainties than their angular diameters (typically of the order of ~10 milliarcsecond) and also because stellar catalogs were not accurate to the milliarcsecond level. Despite the difficulties, at the time of this writing, 43 occultations by 22 different Trans-Neptunian Objects, and 17 occultations by 5 Centaurs have been detected thanks to the efforts of several teams. Due to the complications of accurately predicting and observing these events, most of the successes have been achieved through wide international collaboration, which is a key issue to succeed in observing stellar occultations by TNOs. Multichord occultations are typically detected at a rate of ~3 per year on average, whereas the majority of the observed occultations are single-chord detections, which means that only one site detects the occultation. In these cases, no tight constraints on size and shape can be derived from those observations alone. Here we review most of the aspects involved in the complex process to successfully observe occultations, and present some of the lessons learned.","J. L. Ortiz, B. Sicardy, J. I. B. Camargo, P.

810,"Chandra HRC observations are investigated for evidence of proper motion and brightness changes in the X-ray jet of the nearby radio galaxy M87. Using images spanning 5 years, proper motion is measured in the X-ray knot HST-1, with a superluminal apparent speed of $6.3 \pm 0.4 c$, or $24.1 \pm 1.6\rm\ mas\ yr^{-1}$, and in Knot D, with a speed of $2.4\pm 0.6c$. Upper limits are placed on the speeds of the remaining jet features. The X-ray knot speeds are in excellent agreement with existing measurements in the radio, optical, and ultraviolet. Comparing the X-ray results with images from the Hubble Space Telescope indicates that the X-ray and optical/UV emitting regions co-move. The X-ray knots also vary by up to 73% in brightness, whereas there is no evidence of brightness changes in the optical/UV. Using the synchrotron cooling models, we determine lower limits on magnetic field strengths of $\sim 420~\mu \rm G$ and $\sim 230~\mu \rm G$ for HST-1 and Knot A, respectively, consistent with estimates of the equipartition fields. Together, these results lend strong support to the synchrotron cooling model for Knot HST-1, which requires that its superluminal motion reflects the speed of relativistic bulk flow in the jet.","Bradford Snios, Paul E.

811,"The latest analysis of the cosmic microwave background by the Planck team finds more smoothing of the acoustic peaks in the temperature power spectrum than predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Here we investigate whether this additional smoothing can be mimicked by an oscillatory feature, generated during inflation, that is similar to the acoustic peaks but out of phase. We consider oscillations generated by oscillating modulations of the background---e.g., due to heavy fields or modulated potentials---and by sharp features. We show that it is difficult to induce oscillations that are linear (or almost linear) in $k$ by oscillatory modulations of the background. We find, however, that a sharp bumpy feature in the sound speed of perturbations is able to produce the desired oscillations. The scenario can be tested by combining CMB and BAO data.","Guillem DomÃ¨nech, Marc Kamionkowski",No comment found,1905.04323v1,No journal ref found,Marc Kamionkowski,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04323v1,2019-05-10 18:03:03+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,Lensing anomaly and oscillations in the primordial power spectrum,2019-05-10 18:03:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04323v1
812,"Two studies utilizing sparse aperture masking (SAM) interferometry and $H_{\rm \alpha}$ differential imaging have reported multiple jovian companions around the young solar-mass star, LkCa 15 (LkCa 15 bcd): the first claimed direct detection of infant, newly-formed planets (""protoplanets""). We present new near-infrared direct imaging/spectroscopy from the SCExAO system coupled with the CHARIS integral field spectrograph and multi-epoch thermal infrared imaging from Keck/NIRC2 of LkCa 15 at high Strehl ratios. These data provide the first direct imaging look at the same wavelengths and in the same locations where previous studies identified the LkCa 15 protoplanets and thus offer the first decisive test of their existence.   The data do not reveal these planets. Instead, we resolve extended emission tracing a dust disk with a brightness and location comparable to that claimed for LkCa 15 bcd. Forward-models attributing this signal to orbiting planets are inconsistent with the combined SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2 data. An inner disk provides a more compelling explanation for the SAM detections and perhaps also the claimed $H_{\alpha}$ detection of LkCa 15 b.   We conclude that there is currently no clear, direct evidence for multiple protoplanets orbiting LkCa 15, although the system likely contains at least one unseen jovian companion. To identify jovian companions around LkCa 15 from future observations, the inner disk should be detected and its effect modeled, removed, and shown to be distinguishable from planets. Protoplanet candidates identified from similar systems should likewise be clearly distinguished from disk emission through modeling.","Thayne Currie, Christian Marois, Lucas Cieza, Gijs Mulders, Kellen Lawson, Claudio Caceres, Dary Rodriguez-Ruiz, John Wisniewski, Olivier Guyon, Timothy Brandt, N.

813,"We present a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations, using the FIRE-2 feedback physics together with explicit treatment of magnetic fields, anisotropic conduction and viscosity, and cosmic rays (CRs) injected by supernovae (including anisotropic diffusion, streaming, adiabatic, hadronic and Coulomb losses). We survey systems from ultra-faint dwarf ($M_{\ast}\sim 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$) through Milky Way masses, systematically vary CR parameters (e.g. the diffusion coefficient $\kappa$ and streaming velocity), and study an ensemble of galaxy properties (masses, star formation histories, mass profiles, phase structure, morphologies). We confirm previous conclusions that magnetic fields, conduction, and viscosity on resolved ($\gtrsim 1\,$pc) scales have small effects on bulk galaxy properties. CRs have relatively weak effects on all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs ($M_{\ast} \ll 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$), or at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 1-2$), for any physically-reasonable parameters. However at higher masses ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) and $z\lesssim 1-2$, CRs can suppress star formation by factors $\sim 2-4$, given relatively high effective diffusion coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim 3\times10^{29}\,{\rm cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$. At lower $\kappa$, CRs take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose energy to hadronic collisions, producing negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission. But around $\kappa\sim 3\times10^{29}\,{\rm cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$, CRs escape the galaxy and build up a CR-pressure-dominated halo which supports dense, cool ($T\ll 10^{6}$\,K) gas that would otherwise rain onto the galaxy. CR heating (from collisional and streaming losses) is never dominant.","Philip F. Hopkins, T. K. Chan, Shea Garrison-Kimmel, Suoqing Ji, Kung-Yi Su, Cameron B.

814,"Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are among the most luminous galaxies in the Universe. Powered by highly obscured, possibly Compton-thick, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Hot DOGs are characterized by SEDs that are very red in the mid-IR yet dominated by the host galaxy stellar emission in the UV and optical. An earlier study identified a sub-sample of Hot DOGs with significantly enhanced UV emission. One target, W0204-0506, was studied in detail and, based on Chandra observations, it was concluded that the enhanced emission was most likely due to either extreme unobscured star-formation (${\rm SFR}>1000~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$) or to light from the highly obscured AGN scattered by gas or dust into our line of sight. Here, we present a follow-up study of W0204-0506 as well as two more Hot DOGs with excess UV emission. For the two new objects we obtained Chandra/ACIS-S observations, and for all three targets we obtained HST/WFC3 F555W and F160W imaging. We conclude that the excess UV emission is primarily dominated by light from the central highly obscured, hyper-luminous AGN that has been scattered into our line of sight.

816,"The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue has enabled numerous studies in cosmic magnetism, and will continue being a unique dataset complementing future polarisation surveys. Robust comparisons with these new surveys will however require further understandings in the systematic effects present in the NVSS RM catalogue. In this paper, we make careful comparisons between our new on-axis broadband observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the NVSS RM results for 23 sources. We found that two unpolarised sources were reported as polarised at about 0.5% level in the RM catalogue, and noted significant differences between our newly derived RM values and the catalogue values for the remaining 21 sources. These discrepancies are attributed to off-axis instrumental polarisation in the NVSS RM catalogue. By adopting the 0.5% above as the typical off-axis instrumental polarisation amplitude, we quantified its effect on the reported RMs with a simulation, and found that on average the RM uncertainties in the catalogue have to be increased by $\approx$ 10% to account for the off-axis instrumental polarisation effect. This effect is more substantial for sources with lower fractional polarisation, and is a function of the source's true RM. Moreover, the distribution of the resulting RM uncertainty is highly non-Gaussian. With the extra RM uncertainty incorporated, we found that the RM values from the two observations for most (18 out of 21) of our polarised targets can be reconciled. The remaining three are interpreted as showing hints of time variabilities in RM.","Yik Ki Ma, S. A. Mao, Jeroen Stil, Aritra Basu, Jennifer West, Carl Heiles, Alex S. Hill, S. K.

818,"We use observations of heavy elements in very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.5) in order to place constraints on the viability of collapsar models as a significant source of the r-process. We combine bipolar explosion nucleosynthesis calculations with recent disk calculations to make predictions of the observational imprints these explosions would leave on very metal-poor stars. We find that a source of low (~ 0.1-0.5 $M_\odot$) Fe mass which also yields a relatively high (> 0.08 $M_\odot$) r-process mass would, after subsequently mixing and forming new stars, result in [r/Fe] abundances up to three orders of magnitude higher than those seen in stars. In order to match inferred abundances, 10-10$^3 M_\odot$ of Fe would need be efficiently incorporated into the r-process ejecta. We show that Fe enhancement and hence [r/Fe] dilution from other nearby supernovae is not able to explain the observations unless significant inflow of pristine gas occurs before the ejecta are able to form new stars. Finally, we show that the inferred [Eu/Fe] abundances require levels of gas mixing which are in conflict with other properties of r-process enhanced metal-poor stars. Our results suggest that early r-process production is likely to be spatially uncorrelated with Fe production, a condition which can be satisfied by neutron star mergers due to their large kick velocities and purely r-process yields.","Phillip Macias, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz","6 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL",1905.04315v1,No journal ref found,Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04315v1,2019-05-10 18:00:04+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Constraining Collapsar r-Process Models through Stellar Abundances,2019-05-10 18:00:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04315v1
819,"The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue is invaluable for the study of cosmic magnetism. However, the RM values reported in it can be affected by n$\pi$-ambiguity, resulting in deviations of the reported RM from the true values by multiples of +-652.9 rad m-2. We therefore set off to observationally constrain the fraction of sources in the RM catalogue affected by this ambiguity. New broadband spectro-polarimetric observations were performed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1--2 GHz, with 23 n$\pi$-ambiguity candidates selected by their peculiarly high |RM| values. We identified nine sources with erroneous RM values due to n$\pi$-ambiguity and 11 with reliable RM values. In addition, we found two sources to be unpolarised and one source to be inconsistent with neither n$\pi$-ambiguity nor reliable RM cases. By comparing the statistical distributions of the above two main classes, we devised a measure of how much a source's RM deviates from that of its neighbours: $\Delta/\sigma$, which we found to be a good diagnostic of n$\pi$-ambiguity. With this, we estimate that there are at least 50 sources affected by n$\pi$-ambiguity among the 37,543 sources in the catalogue. Finally, we explored the Faraday complexities of our sources revealed by our broadband observations.","Yik Ki Ma, S. A. Mao, Jeroen Stil, Aritra Basu, Jennifer West, Carl Heiles, Alex S. Hill, S. K.

820,"We infer the properties of massive star populations using the far-ultraviolet stellar continua of 61 star-forming galaxies: 42 at low-z observed with HST and 19 at z~2 from the Megasaura sample. We fit each stellar continuum with a linear combination of up to 50 single age and single metallicity Starburst99 models. From these fits, we derive light-weighted ages and metallicities, which agree with stellar wind and photospheric spectral features, and infer the spectral shapes and strengths of the ionizing continua. Inferred light-weighted stellar metallicities span 0.05-1.5 Z$_\odot$ and are similar to the measured nebular metallicities. We quantify the ionizing continua using the ratio of the ionizing flux at 900\AA\ to the non-ionizing flux at 1500\AA\ and demonstrate the evolution of this ratio with stellar age and metallicity using theoretical single burst models. These single burst models only match the inferred ionizing continua of half of the sample, while the other half are described by a mixture of stellar ages. Mixed age populations produce stronger and harder ionizing spectra than continuous star formation histories, but, contrary to previous studies that assume constant star formation, have similar stellar and nebular metallicities. Stellar population age and metallicity affect the far-UV continua in different and distinguishable ways; assuming a constant star formation history diminishes the diagnostic power. Finally, we provide simple prescriptions to determine the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion}$) from the stellar population properties. $\xi_{ion}$ has a range of log($\xi_{ion})=24.4-25.7$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ that depends on stellar age, metallicity, star formation history, and contributions from binary star evolution. These stellar population properties must be observationally determined to determine the number of ionizing photons generated by massive stars.","J. Chisholm, J. R. Rigby, M. Bayliss, D. A. Berg, H.

821,"In Paper I (Safarzadeh & Berger 2019) we studied the determination of the delay time distribution (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) through scaling relations between halo/stellar mass and the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies hosting gravitational wave (GW) events in the local universe. Here we explore how a detailed reconstruction of the individual SFHs of BNS merger host galaxies can improve on the use of the scaling relations. We use galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, which is mass complete at $M_*>10^9$ M$_\odot$ in the redshift range $0.05<z<0.08$. We use the reconstructed SFHs derived from the Prospector code, for two distinct sets of priors (favoring continuous and bursty SFHs), and convolve those with power law DTDs characterized by an index $\Gamma$ and a minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}$. We find that with this approach $\mathcal{O}(100)-\mathcal{O}(300)$ host galaxies are required to constrain the DTD parameters, with the number depending on the choice of SFH prior and on the parameters of the true DTD. We further show that using only the host galaxies of BNS mergers, as opposed to the full population of potential host galaxies in the relevant cosmic volume, leads to a minor bias in the recovered DTD parameters. The required host galaxy sample size is nearly an order of magnitude smaller relative to the approach of using scaling relations, and we expect such a host galaxy sample to be collected within a decade or two, prior to the advent of third-generation GW detectors.","Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Edo Berger, Joel Leja, Joshua S.

822,"Discovering other worlds the size of our own has been a long-held dream of astronomers. The transiting planets Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, which belong to a multi-planet system, hold a very special place among the many groundbreaking discoveries of the Kepler mission because they finally realized that dream. The radius of Kepler-20f is essentially identical to that of the Earth, while Kepler-20e is even smaller (0.87 R[Earth]), and was the first exoplanet to earn that distinction. Their masses, however, are too light to measure with current instrumentation, and this has prevented their confirmation by the usual Doppler technique that has been used so successfully to confirm many other larger planets. To persuade themselves of the planetary nature of these tiny objects, astronomers employed instead a statistical technique to ""validate"" them, showing that the likelihood they are planets is orders of magnitude larger than a false positive. Kepler-20e and 20f orbit their Sun-like star every 6.1 and 19.6 days, respectively, and are most likely of rocky composition. Here we review the history of how they were found, and present an overview of the methodology that was used to validate them.","Guillermo Torres, Francois Fressin","19 pages including figures and tables, to appear in a special issue

823,"Galaxy mergers are a fundamental part of galaxy evolution. To study the resulting mass distributions of different kinds of galaxy mergers, we present a simulation suite of 36 high-resolution isolated merger simulations, exploring a wide range of parameter space in terms of mass ratios (mu = 1:5, 1:10, 1:50, 1:100) and orbital parameters. We find that mini mergers deposit a higher fraction of their mass in the outer halo compared to minor mergers, while their contribution to the central mass distribution is highly dependent on the orbital impact parameter: for larger pericentric distances we find that the centre of the host galaxy is almost not contaminated by merger particles. We also find that the median of the resulting radial mass distribution for mini mergers differs significantly from the predictions of simple theoretical tidal-force models. Furthermore, we find that mini mergers can increase the size of the host disc significantly without changing the global shape of the galaxy, if the impact occurs in the disc plane, thus providing a possible explanation for extended low-surface brightness disks reported in observations. Finally, we find clear evidence that streams are a strong indication of nearly circular infall of a satellite (with large angular momentum), whereas the appearance of shells clearly points to (nearly) radial satellite infall.","Geray S.

824,"Over the past three decades instruments on the ground and in space have discovered thousands of planets outside the solar system. These observations have given rise to an astonishingly detailed picture of the demographics of short-period planets, but are incomplete at longer periods where both the sensitivity of transit surveys and radial velocity signals plummet. Even more glaring is that the spectra of planets discovered with these indirect methods are either inaccessible (radial velocity detections) or only available for a small subclass of transiting planets with thick, clear atmospheres. Direct detection can be used to discover and characterize the atmospheres of planets at intermediate and wide separations, including non-transiting exoplanets. Today, a small number of exoplanets have been directly imaged, but they represent only a rare class of young, self-luminous super-Jovian-mass objects orbiting tens to hundreds of AU from their host stars. Atmospheric characterization of planets in the <5 AU regime, where radial velocity (RV) surveys have revealed an abundance of other worlds, is technically feasible with 30-m class apertures in combination with an advanced AO system, coronagraph, and suite of spectrometers and imagers. There is a vast range of unexplored science accessible through astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy of rocky planets, ice giants, and gas giants.

829,"MRC 0116+111 is a nearby ($z=0.132$) poor galaxy group, which was previously known for exhibiting a bright diffuse radio emission with no central point-like source, presumably related to a past activity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in its central cD galaxy. Here, we present an X-ray observation ($\sim$30 ks of cleaned XMM-Newton/EPIC exposure) of this system, allowing us for the first time a detailed comparison between the thermal and non-thermal components of its intragroup medium (IGrM). Remarkably, we find that the radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratio is among the highest ever observed for a diffuse extragalactic source so far, while the extent of the observed radio emission is about three times larger than its observed soft X-ray emission. Although powerful AGN activity may have disturbed the dynamics of the thermal IGrM in the form of turbulence, possibly re-energising part of the relativistic electron population, the gas properties lie within the $L_X$-$T$ scaling relation established previously for other groups. The upper limit we find for the non-thermal inverse-Compton X-ray emission translates into a surprisingly high lower limit for the volume-averaged magnetic field of the group ($\ge$4.3 $\mu$G).

830,"AG Draconis is a strongly interacting binary system which manifests characteristic symbiotic activity of alternating quiescent and active stages. The latter ones consist of the series of individual outbursts repeating at about a one-year interval. After seven years of flat quiescence following the 2006-2008 major outbursts, in the late spring of 2015, the symbiotic system AG Dra started to become brighter again toward what appeared to be a new minor outburst. The current outburst activity of AG Dra was confirmed by the following three outbursts in April 2016, May 2017 and April 2018. The photometric and spectroscopic observations suggest that all these outbursts are of the hot type. Such behaviour is considerably peculiar in almost 130-year history of observing of this object, because the major outbursts at the beginning of active stages are typically cool ones.

832,"A simple model of dark matter contains a light Dirac field charged under a hidden U(1) gauge symmetry. When a chiral matter content in a strong dynamics satisfies the t'Hooft anomaly matching condition, a massless baryon is a natural candidate of the light Dirac field. One realization is the same matter content as the standard SU(5)$\times$U(1)$_{(B-L)}$ grand unified theory. We propose a chiral [SU(5)$\times$U(1)]$^4$ gauge theory as a unified model of the SM and DM sectors. The low-energy dynamics, which was recently studied, is governed by the hidden U(1)$_4$ gauge interaction and the third-family U(1)$_{(B-L)_3}$ gauge interaction. This model can realize self-interacting dark matter and alleviate the small-scale crisis of collisionless cold dark matter in the cosmological structure formation.

834,"OGLE-LMC-DPV-065 is an interacting binary whose double-hump long photometric cycle remains hitherto unexplained. We analyze photometric time series available in archive datasets spanning 124 years and present the analysis of new high-resolution spectra. A refined orbital period is found of 10\fd0316267 $\pm$ 0\fd0000056 without any evidence of variability. In spite of this constancy, small but significant changes in timings of the secondary eclipse are detected. We show that the long period continuously decreases from 350 to 218 days during 13 years, then remains almost constant for about 10 years. Our study of radial velocities indicates a circular orbit for the binary and yields a mass ratio of 0.203 $\pm$ 0.001. From the analysis of the orbital light curve we find that the system contains 13.8 and 2.81 \msun\ stars of radii 8.8 and 12.6 \rsun\ and absolute bolometric magnitudes -6.4 and -3.0, respectively. The orbit semi-major axis is 49.9 \rsun\ and the stellar temperatures are 25460 K and 9825 K. We find evidence for an optically and geometrically thick disk around the hotter star. According to our model, the disk has a radius of 25 \rsun, central and outer vertical thickness of 1.6 \rsun\ and 3.5 \rsun, and temperature of 9380 K at its outer edge. Two shock regions located at roughly opposite parts of the outer disk rim can explain the light curves asymmetries.

835,"In this paper, we present the analysis and results of a direct measurement of the cosmic-ray proton spectrum with the CALET instrument onboard the International Space Station, including the detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties. The observation period used in this analysis is from October 13, 2015 to August 31, 2018 (1054 days). We have achieved the very wide energy range necessary to carry out measurements of the spectrum from 50 GeV to 10 TeV covering, for the first time in space, with a single instrument the whole energy interval previously investigated in most cases in separate subranges by magnetic spectrometers (BESS-TeV, PAMELA, and AMS-02) and calorimetric instruments (ATIC, CREAM, and NUCLEON). The observed spectrum is consistent with AMS-02 but extends to nearly an order of magnitude higher energy, showing a very smooth transition of the power-law spectral index from -2.81 +- 0.03 (50--500 GeV) neglecting solar modulation effects (or -2.87 +- 0.06 including solar modulation effects in the lower energy region) to -2.56 +- 0.04 (1--10 TeV), thereby confirming the existence of spectral hardening and providing evidence of a deviation from a single power law by more than 3 sigma.","O.

836,"We study a simple class of dark matter models with N_f copies of electroweak fermionic multiplets, stabilized by O(N_F) global symmetry. Unlike conventional minimal dark matter which usually suffers from Landau poles, in these models the gauge coupling g_2 has a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point, and thus is asymptotically safe as long as N_F is large enough. These fermionic n-plet models have only two free parameters: N_F and a common mass M_DM, which relate to dark matter relic abundance. We find that the mass of triplet fermionic dark matter with N_F being dozens of flavors can be several hundred GeV, which is testable on LHC. A benefit of large N_F is that DM pair annihilation rate in dwarf galaxies is effectively suppressed by 1/N_F, and thus they can evade the constraint from gamma-ray continuous spectrum observation. For the case of triplets, we find that the models in the range 3 <= N_F <= 20 are consistent with all current experiments. However, for N_F quintuplets, even with large N_F they are still disfavored by the gamma-ray continuous spectrum.","Chengfeng Cai, Hong-Hao Zhang","15 pages, 4 figures",1905.04227v1,No journal ref found,Hong-Hao Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04227v1,2019-05-10 15:50:36+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.CO,Minimal asymptotically safe dark matter,2019-05-10 15:50:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04227v1
837,"The production of very high energy muons inside an extensive air shower is observable at neutrino telescopes and sensitive to the composition of the primary cosmic ray. Here we discuss five different sources of these muons: pion and kaon decays; charmed hadron decays; rare decays of unflavored mesons; photon conversion into a muon pair; and photon conversion into a J/psi vector meson decaying into muons. We solve the cascade equations for a $10^{10.5}$ GeV proton primary and find that unflavored mesons and gamma conversions are the two main sources of $E > 10^9$ GeV muons, while charm decays dominate at $10^5$ GeV $ < E < 10^9$ GeV. In inclined events one of these muons may deposite a large fraction of its energy near the surface, implying anomalies in the longitudinal profile of the shower and in the muon to electron count at the ground level. In particular, we show that 1 out of 300 proton showers of $10^{10.5}$ GeV will include an $E > 10^7$ GeV deposition within 500 g/cm$^2$. We also show that the production of high energy muons is very different in proton, iron or photon showers. In particular, conversions $\gamma \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ are the main source of $E > 10^5$ GeV muons in photon showers.","Carmen GÃ¡mez, Miguel GutiÃ©rrez, Juan S.

838,"Over the past decade, the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution in the Universe. The standard technique used to reconstruct the CMB lensing signal employs the quadratic estimator (QE) method, which has recently been shown to be suboptimal for lensing measurements on very small scales in temperature and polarization data. We implement a simple, more optimal method for the small-scale regime, which involves taking the direct inverse of the background gradient. We derive new techniques to make continuous maps of lensing using this ""Gradient-Inversion"" (GI) method and validate our method with simulated data, finding good agreement with predictions. For idealized simulations of lensing cross- and autospectra that neglect foregrounds, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than previous quadratic estimator methods in temperature; at $L=5000-9000$, it reduces errors on the lensing auto-power spectrum by a factor of $\sim 4$ for both idealized CMB-S4 and Simons Observatory-like experiments and by a factor of $\sim 2.6$ for cross-correlations of CMB-S4-like lensing reconstruction and the true lensing field. We caution that the level of the neglected small-scale foreground power, while low in polarization, is very high in temperature; though we briefly outline foreground mitigation methods, further work on this topic is required. Nevertheless, our results show the future potential for improved small-scale CMB lensing measurements, which could provide stronger constraints on cosmological parameters and astrophysics at high redshifts.","Boryana Hadzhiyska, Blake D.

839,"The Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array (AMIGA) aims to both extend the detection range of the Pierre Auger Observatory down to energies $\sim 10^{16.5}~\mathrm{eV}$ and to measure the muon content of extensive air showers. To accomplish these goals, its detection system is composed of an array of coupled water-Cherenkov and scintillation detectors deployed in a graded triangular grid of 433 and 750\,m spacings. At each position, the scintillation detector is buried $2.3~\mathrm{m}$ deep so as to shield it from the air shower electromagnetic component and thus only measure the muon component. These muon detectors have $30~\mathrm{m^2}$ area split into modules, each of them highly segmented in 64 plastic-scintillator strips with an embedded wavelength-shifter optical fiber to transport light to an optical sensor located at the center of the module. During the engineering array phase (finished in November 2017) two module areas ($5~\mathrm{m^2}$ and $10~\mathrm{m^2}$) and two optical sensors (photo-multiplier tubes and silicon-photomultipliers) were tested. In this work, we present the final performance of the muon detectors equipped with silicon-photomultipliers which were thereafter selected as the baseline design for the AMIGA production phase.

841,"Rings and radial gaps are ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks, yet their possible connection to planet formation is currently subject to intense debates. In principle, giant planet formation leads to wide gaps which separate the gas and dust mass reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass planets lead to shallow gaps which are manifested mainly on the dust component. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the star HD169142, host to a prominent disk with deep wide gaps that sever the disk into inner and outer regions. The new ALMA high resolution images allow for the outer ring to be resolved as three narrow rings. The HD169142 disk thus hosts both the wide gaps trait of transition disks and a narrow ring system similar to those observed in the TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond a deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed rings are narrow in radial extent (width/radius of 1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2 and 3.4/76.0, in au) and have asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle ring are separated by 7 au while the middle and outermost ring are distanced by ~12 au. Using hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple explanation, involving a single migrating low mass planet (10 M$_\oplus$), entirely accounts for such an apparently complex phenomenon. Inward migration of the planet naturally explains the ring's asymmetric mutual separation. The isolation of HD169142's outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to interpret the detailed architecture of the outer region of protoplanetary disks with low mass planet formation of mini-Neptune's size, i.e. as in the protosolar nebula.","SebastiÃ¡n PÃ©rez, Simon Casassus, ClÃ©ment Baruteau, Ruobing Dong, Antonio Hales, Lucas Cieza","13 pages. 4 figures in main text plus 4 in appendix.

842,"This paper is a pedagogical introduction to models of gravity and how to constrain them through cosmological observations. We focus on the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and on the quantities that can be measured with a minimum of assumptions. Alternatives or extensions of General Relativity have been proposed ever since its early years. Because of Lovelock theorem, modifying gravity in four dimensions typically means adding new degrees of freedom. The simplest way is to include a scalar field coupled to the curvature tensor terms. The most general way of doing so without incurring in the Ostrogradski instability is the Horndeski Lagrangian and its extensions. Testing gravity means therefore, in its simplest term, testing the Horndeski Lagrangian. Since local gravity experiments can always be evaded by assuming some screening mechanism or that baryons are decoupled, or even that the effects of modified gravity are visible only at early times, we need to test gravity with cosmological observations in the late universe (large-scale structure) and in the early universe (cosmic microwave background). In this work we review the basic tools to test gravity at cosmological scales, focusing on model-independent measurements.","Luca Amendola, Dario Bettoni, Ana Marta Pinho, Santiago Casas",Review paper.

843,"We present the first cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN). The analysis uses a subsample of 207 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia from the first three years of DES-SN, combined with a low-redshift sample of 122 SNe from the literature. Our ""DES-SN3YR"" result from these 329 SNe Ia is based on a series of companion analyses and improvements covering SN Ia discovery, spectroscopic selection, photometry, calibration, distance bias corrections, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. For a flat LCDM model we find a matter density Omega_m = 0.331 +_ 0.038. For a flat wCDM model, and combining our SN Ia constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a dark energy equation of state w = -0.978 +_ 0.059, and Omega_m = 0.321 +_ 0.018. For a flat w0waCDM model, and combining probes from SN Ia, CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, we find w0 = -0.885 +_ 0.114 and wa = -0.387 +_ 0.430.

844,"Despite deflections by Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the distribution of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) over the celestial sphere remains a most promising observable for the identification of their sources. Thanks to a large number of detected events over the past years, a large-scale anisotropy at energies above 8 EeV has been identified, and there are also indications from the Telescope Array and Pierre Auger Collaborations of deviations from isotropy at intermediate angular scales (about 20 degrees) at the highest energies. In this contribution, we map the flux of UHECRs over the full sky at energies beyond each of two major features in the UHECR spectrum -- the ankle and the flux suppression --, and we derive limits for anisotropy on different angular scales in the two energy regimes. In particular, full-sky coverage enables constraints on low-order multipole moments without assumptions about the strength of higher-order multipoles. Following previous efforts from the two Collaborations, we build full-sky maps accounting for the relative exposure of the arrays and differences in the energy normalizations. The procedure relies on cross-calibrating the UHECR fluxes reconstructed in the declination band around the celestial equator covered by both observatories. We present full-sky maps at energies above 10 EeV and 50 EeV, using the largest datasets shared across UHECR collaborations to date. We report on anisotropy searches exploiting full-sky coverage and discuss possible constraints on the distribution of UHECR sources.","J. Biteau, T. Bister, L. Caccianiga, O.

845,"Gas and dust properties in the Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex have been investigated with emission lines from atomic hydrogen (HI) and 12CO molecule, dust optical depth at 353 GHz ($\tau_{353}$), and $J$-band infrared extinction ($A_{J}$). We have found a scatter correlation between the HI integrated intensity ($W_{\rm HI}$) and $\tau_{353}$ in the Chamaeleon region. The scattering has been examined in terms of possible large optical depth in HI emission ($\tau_{\rm HI}$) using a total column density ($N_{\rm H}$) model based on $\tau_{353}$. A nonlinear relation of $\tau_{353}$ with the $\sim$1.2 power of $A_{J}$ has been found in opaque regions ($A_{J}$ $\gtrsim$ 0.3 mag), which may indicate dust evolution effect. If we apply this nonlinear relation to the $N_{\rm H}$ model (i.e., $N_{\rm H} \propto \tau_{353}^{1/1.2}$) allowing arbitrary $\tau_{\rm HI}$, the model curve reproduces well the $W_{\rm HI}$-$\tau_{353}$ scatter correlation, suggesting optically thick HI ($\tau_{\rm HI} \sim$1.3) extended around the molecular clouds. Based on the correlations between the CO integrated intensity and the $N_{\rm H}$ model, we have then derived the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor ($X_{\rm CO}$) on $\sim$1.5$^{\circ}$ scales (corresponding to $\sim$4 persec) and found spatial variations of $X_{\rm CO}$ $\sim$(0.5-3)$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s across the cloud complex, possibly depending on the radiation field inside or surrounding the molecular clouds.

846,"In order to get the primary energy of cosmic rays from their extensive air showers using the fluorescence detection technique, the invisible energy should be added to the measured calorimetric energy. The invisible energy is the energy carried away by particles that do not deposit all their energy in the atmosphere. It has traditionally been calculated using Monte Carlo simulations that are dependent on the assumed primary particle mass and on model predictions for neutrino and muon production. In this work the invisible energy is obtained directly from events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The method applied is based on the correlation of the measurements of the muon number at the ground with the invisible energy of the showers. By using it, the systematic uncertainties related to the unknown mass composition and to the high energy hadronic interaction models are significantly reduced, improving in this way the estimation of the energy scale of the Observatory.",Analisa G.

847,"We present a two-dimensional mapping of stellar population age components, emission-line fluxes, gas excitation and kinematics within the inner $\sim200$ pc of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2110. We used the Gemini North Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) in the J and K bands at a spatial resolution of $\sim22$ pc. The unresolved nuclear continuum is originated in combined contributions of young stellar population (SP; age$\leq100$ Myr), a featureless AGN continuum and hot dust emission. The young-intermediate SP ($100<$age$\leq700$ Myr) is distributed in a ring-shaped structure at $\approx140$ pc from the nucleus, which is roughly coincident with the lowest values of the stellar velocity dispersion. In the inner $\approx115$ pc the old SP (age$>2$ Gyr) is dominant. The [FeII]1.25$\mu$m emission-line flux distribution is correlated with the radio emission and its kinematics comprise two components, one from gas rotating in the galaxy plane and another from gas in outflow within a bicone oriented along north-south. These outflows seem to originate in the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas producing shocks that are the main excitation mechanism of the [FeII] emission.

848,"The orthodox approach for understanding a dynamical system is to establish its equation of motion, by which one can unveil its dynamical behavior at a given system parameter set, and reveal how the dynamic behavior evolves as the system parameters change. Here we show that this task can be fulfilled with a learning machine in a model-free way. We find that, based only on a segmental time series of a state variable recorded at present stage, the dynamics exhibited by the learning machine at different training stages can be mapped to the dynamics of the target system along a particular path in its parameter space following an appropriate training strategy that monotonously decreases the cost. This path is important, because along which the primary dynamical properties of the target system will emerge subsequently, in the simple-to-complex order, matching closely to the evolution of a natural system. A theoretical framework is proposed to explain the underlying mechanism. This revealed function of the learning machine opens up a novel way to probe the global dynamical properties of a black-box system without the equation of motion established artificially, and as such it might have huge potential applications. As an application example, this method is applied to infer what dynamical stages a variable star has experienced and how it will evolve in future by using the light curve observed presently.",Hong Zhao,"16 pages, 10 figures",1905.08313v1,No journal ref found,Hong Zhao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08313v1,2019-05-10 13:31:19+00:00,cs.LG,cs.LG|astro-ph.SR|math.DS|nlin.CD,Prediction of System Evolution by Learning Machine,2019-05-10 13:31:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08313v1
849,"We present a novel method to model galactic scale star formation and the resulting emission from star clusters and the multi-phase interstellar medium. We combine global parameters, such as SFR and CMF, with {\sc warpfield} which provides a description of the feedback-driven evolution of individual star-forming regions. Our approach includes stellar evolution, stellar winds, radiation pressure, supernovae, all of which couple to the dynamical evolution of the parental cloud in a highly non-linear fashion. The heating of diffuse gas and dust is calculated self-consistently with the age, mass and density dependent escape fractions of the local star-forming regions. From this we construct the interstellar radiation field at any point in the galaxy, and we employ the multi-frequency Monte Carlo radiative transfer code {\sc polaris} to produce synthetic emission maps for the one-to-one comparison with observational data.   We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by applying the method to a Milky Way like galaxy built-up in a high-resolution cosmological MHD simulation. We give three examples. First, we compute the multi-scale distribution of electron $n_{e^-}$ and $T_{e^{-}}$ and synthesize the MW all-sky H$\alpha$ emission. We use a multipole expansion method to show that the resulting maps are consistent with observations. Second, we predict the expected \SIII 9530~\AA\ emission. This line is a key target of several planned large survey programs. It suffers less extinction than other diagnostic lines and provides information about star formation in very dense environments that are otherwise observationally not readily accessible. Third, we explore the effects of differential extinction as seen by an extra-galactic observer, and discuss the consequences for the correct interpretation of \Ha emission as a star-formation rate tracer at different viewing angles.(abridged)","E.

850,"Small stellar systems like dwarf galaxies are suggested to be the main building blocks of our Galaxy by numerical simulations in Lambda CDM models. The existence of star streams like Sagittarius tidal stream indicates that dwarf galaxies play a role in the formation of the Milky Way. However, it is unclear how many and what kind of stars in our Galaxy are originated from satellite dwarf galaxies, which could be constrained by chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Here we report on the discovery of a metal-poor star with an extreme r-process enhancement and alpha-element deficiency. In this star, the abundance ratio of the r-process element Eu with respect to Fe is more than one order of magnitude higher than the Sun and the metallicity is 1/20 of the solar one. Such kind of stars have been found in present-day dwarf galaxies, providing the clearest chemical signature of past accretion events. The long timescale of chemical evolution of the host dwarf galaxy expected from the abundance of alpha element with respect to Fe suggests that the accretion occurred in a relatively late phase compared to most of the accretions that formed the bulk of the Milky Way halo.","Qian-Fan Xing, Gang Zhao, Wako Aoki, Satoshi Honda, Hai-Ning Li, Miho N.

851,"Context. The bipolar outflows associated with low-mass protostars create cavities in the infalling envelope. These cavities are illuminated by the central protostar and inner disk, creating a bipolar scattered light nebula at near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths. The variability of the scattered light nebula in both total intensity and intensity as a function of position in the scattered light nebula can provide important insights into the structure of the inner disk that cannot be spatially resolved. Aims. We aim to determine the likelihood that a warped inner disk is the origin of the surface brightness variability in the bipolar scattered light nebula associated with L1527 IRS. Methods. We present results from near-IR imaging conducted over the course of seven years, with periods of monthly cadence monitoring. We used Monte Carlo radiative transfer models to interpret the observations. Results. We find a time varying, asymmetrical brightness in the scattered light nebulae within the outflow cavities of the protostar. Starting in 2007, the surface brightnesses of the eastern and western outflow cavities were roughly symmetric. Then, in 2009, the surface brightnesses of the cavities were found to be asymmetric, with a substantial increase in surface brightness and a larger increase in the eastern outflow cavity. More regular monitoring was conducted from 2011 to 2014, revealing a rotating pattern of surface brightness variability in addition to a slow change of the eastern and western outflow cavities toward symmetry, but still not as symmetric as observed in 2007. We find that an inner disk warp is a feasible mechanism to produce the rotating pattern of surface brightness variability.","Brian T. Cook, John J. Tobin, Michael F. Skrutskie, Matthew J.

853,"Mergers are an important aspect of galaxy formation and evolution. We aim to test whether deep learning techniques can be used to reproduce visual classification of observations, physical classification of simulations and highlight any differences between these two classifications. With one of the main difficulties of merger studies being the lack of a truth sample, we can use our method to test biases in visually identified merger catalogues. A convolutional neural network architecture was developed and trained in two ways: one with observations from SDSS and one with simulated galaxies from EAGLE, processed to mimic the SDSS observations. The SDSS images were also classified by the simulation trained network and the EAGLE images classified by the observation trained network. The observationally trained network achieves an accuracy of 91.5% while the simulation trained network achieves 65.2% on the visually classified SDSS and physically classified EAGLE images respectively. Classifying the SDSS images with the simulation trained network was less successful, only achieving an accuracy of 64.6%, while classifying the EAGLE images with the observation network was very poor, achieving an accuracy of only 53.0% with preferential assignment to the non-merger classification. This suggests that most of the simulated mergers do not have conspicuous merger features and visually identified merger catalogues from observations are incomplete and biased towards certain merger types. The networks trained and tested with the same data perform the best, with observations performing better than simulations, a result of the observational sample being biased towards conspicuous mergers. Classifying SDSS observations with the simulation trained network has proven to work, providing tantalizing prospects for using simulation trained networks for galaxy identification in large surveys.","W.

856,"We introduce a novel abundance matching technique that produces a more accurate estimate of the pre-infall halo mass, $M_{200}$, for satellite galaxies. To achieve this, we abundance match with the mean star formation rate, averaged over the time when a galaxy was forming stars, $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle$, instead of the stellar mass, $M_*$. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the GAMA survey and the Bolshoi simulation, we obtain a statistical $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}_{200}$ relation in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. We then compare the pre-infall halo mass, $M^{\rm abund}_{200}$, derived from this relation with the pre-infall dynamical mass, $M^{\rm dyn}_{200}$, for 21 nearby dSph and dIrr galaxies, finding a good agreement between the two. As a first application, we use our new $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}_{200}$ relation to empirically measure the cumulative mass function of a volume-complete sample of bright Milky Way satellites within 280 kpc of the Galactic centre. Comparing this with a suite of cosmological 'zoom' simulations of Milky Way-mass halos that account for subhalo depletion by the Milky Way disc, we find no missing satellites problem above $M_{200} \sim 10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in the Milky Way. We discuss how this empirical method can be applied to a larger sample of nearby spiral galaxies.","J. I. Read, D. Erkal","15 pages, 7 figures. Final version accepted for publication in MNRAS.

This effort applies the successful quasar selection strategy of the Extremely Luminous Survey in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint ($\sim12,000\,\rm{deg}^2$) to a much larger area ($\sim\rm{21486}\,\rm{deg}^2$). This spectroscopic survey targets the most luminous quasars ($M_{1450}\le-26.5$; $m_{i}\le18.5$) at intermediate redshifts ($z\ge2.8$). Candidates are selected based on a near-infrared JKW2 color cut using WISE AllWISE and 2MASS photometry to mainly reject stellar contaminants. Photometric redshifts ($z_{\rm{reg}}$) and star-quasar classifications for each candidate are calculated from near-infrared and optical photometry using the supervised machine learning technique random forests. We select 806 quasar candidates at $z_{\rm{reg}}\ge2.8$ from a parent sample of 74318 sources. After exclusion of known sources and rejection of candidates with unreliable photometry, we have taken optical identification spectra for 290 of our 334 good PS-ELQS candidates. We report the discovery of 190 new $z\ge2.8$ quasars and an additional 28 quasars at lower redshifts. A total of 44 good PS-ELQS candidates remain unobserved. Including all known quasars at $z\ge2.8$, our quasar selection method has a selection efficiency of at least $77\%$. At lower declinations $-30\le\rm{Decl.}\le0$ we approximately triple the known population of extremely luminous quasars. We provide the PS-ELQS quasar catalog with a total of 592 luminous quasars ($m_{i}\le18.5$, $z\ge2.8$).

The HIFI pipeline processed data from all HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment, as well as, within an interactive environment.

863,"The formation scenario of brown dwarfs is still unclear because observational studies to investigate its initial condition are quite limited. Our systematic survey of nearby low-mass star-forming regions using the Atacama Compact Array (aka Morita array) and the IRAM 30 m telescope in 1.2 mm continuum has identified a centrally concentrated starless condensation with a central H$_2$ volume density of $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, MC5-N, connected to a narrow (width $\sim$0.03 pc) filamentary cloud in the Taurus L1495 region. The mass of the core is $\sim$0.2-0.4 $M_{\odot}$, which is an order of magnitude smaller than typical low-mass prestellar cores. Taking into account a typical core to star formation efficiency for prestellar cores ($\sim$20%-40%) in nearby molecular clouds, brown dwarf(s) or very low-mass star(s) may be going to be formed in this core. We have found possible substructures at the high-density portion of the core, although much higher angular resolution observation is needed to clearly confirm them.

864,"The rather elusive High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations(HFQPO) observed in the X-ray lightcurve of black holes have been seen in a wide range of frequencies, even within one source. It is also notable to have been detected in ""pairs"" of HFQPOs with a close to integer ratio between the frequencies. The aim of this paper is to investigate some of the possible observable that we could obtain from having the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) active in the accretion disc surrounding the compact object.   Using the newly developed GR-AMRVAC code able to follow the evolution of the RWI in a full general relativistic framework, we explore how RWI can reproduce observed HFQPO frequencies ratios and if it is compatible with the observations. In order to model the emission coming from the disc we have linked our general relativistic simulations to the general relativistic ray-tracing GYOTO code and delivered synthetic observables that can be confronted to actual data from binary systems hosting HFQPOs.}{We have demonstrated in our study that some changes in the physical conditions prevailing in the part of the disc where RWI can be triggered leads to various dominant RWI modes whose ratio recovers frequency ratios observed in various X-ray binary systems. In addition, we have also highlighted that when RWI is triggered near the last stable orbit of a spinning black hole, the amplitude of the X-ray modulation increases with the spin of the black hole. Revisiting published data on X-ray binary systems, we show that this type of relationship actually exists in the five systems where an indirect measure of the spin of the black hole is available.","Peggy Varniere, Fabien Casse, Frederic Vincent",accepted by A&A,1905.03984v1,No journal ref found,Frederic Vincent,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03984v1,2019-05-10 07:39:01+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Rossby Wave Instability and High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations   in accretion discs orbiting around black holes,2019-05-10 07:39:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03984v1
865,"The surface of last scattering of the photons in the cosmic microwave background is not a spherical shell. Apart from its finite width, each photon experiences a different gravitational potential along its journey to us, leading to different travel times in different directions. Since all photons were released at the same cosmic time, the photons with longer travel times started farther away from us than those with shorter times. Thus, the surface of last scattering is corrugated, a deformed spherical shell. We present an estimator quadratic in the temperature and polarization fields that could provide a map of the time delays as a function of position on the sky. The signal to noise of this map could exceed unity for the dipole, thereby providing a rare insight into the universe on the largest observable scales.","Peikai Li, Scott Dodelson, Wayne Hu","8 pages, 7 figures",1905.03923v1,No journal ref found,Wayne Hu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03923v1,2019-05-10 03:41:12+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO,Distortions in the Surface of Last Scattering,2019-05-10 03:41:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03923v1
866,"We describe catalog-level simulations of Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) light curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN), and in low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from selection effects and light curve analysis, and to determine bias corrections for SN~Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN~Ia model, incorporates information from observations (PSF, sky noise, zero point), and uses summary information (e.g., detection efficiency vs. signal to noise ratio) based on 10,000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05~mag over the redshift ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly those with extreme red or blue color, distance biases can reach 0.4~mag. Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision measurements of cosmological parameters.

868,"Gas giants are thought to form by runaway accretion: an instability driven by the self-gravity of growing atmospheres that causes accretion rates to rise super-linearly with planet mass. Why runaway should stop at a Jupiter or any other mass is unknown. We consider the proposal that final masses are controlled by circumstellar disc gaps (cavities) opened by planetary gravitational torques. We develop a fully time-dependent theory of gap formation and couple it self-consistently to planetary growth rates. When gaps first open, planetary torques overwhelm viscous torques, and gas depletes as if it were inviscid. In low-viscosity discs, of the kind motivated by recent observations and theory, gaps stay predominantly in this inviscid phase and planet masses finalize at $M_{\rm final}/M_\star\sim(\Omega t_{\rm disc})^{0.07}(H/a)^{2.73}(G\rho_0/\Omega^2)^{1/3}$, with $M_\star$ the host stellar mass, $\Omega$ the planet's orbital angular velocity, $t_{\rm disc}$ the gas disc's lifetime, $H/a$ its aspect ratio, and $\rho_0$ its unperturbed density. This final mass is independent of the dimensionless viscosity $\alpha$ and applies to large orbital distances, typically beyond $\sim$10 AU, where disc scale heights exceed planet radii. It evaluates to a few Jupiter masses at 10-100 AU, increasing gradually with distance as gaps become harder to open.","Sivan Ginzburg, Eugene Chiang",Accepted to MNRAS,1905.03887v1,No journal ref found,Eugene Chiang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03887v1,2019-05-09 23:17:07+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,The End of Runaway: How Gap Opening Limits the Final Masses of Gas   Giants,2019-05-09 23:17:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03887v1
869,"Accreting black holes produce collimated outflows, or jets, that traverse many orders of magnitude in distance, accelerate to relativistic velocities, and collimate into tight opening angles. Of these, perhaps the least understood is jet collimation due to the interaction with the ambient medium. In order to investigate this interaction, we carried out axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets produced by a large accretion disc, spanning over 5 orders of magnitude in time and distance, at an unprecedented resolution. Supported by such a disc, the jet attains a parabolic shape, similar to the M87 galaxy jet, and the product of the Lorentz factor and the jet half-opening angle, $\gamma\theta\ll 1$, similar to values found from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets; this suggests extended discs in AGN. We find that the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium leads to the development of pinch instabilities, which produce significant radial and lateral variability across the jet by converting magnetic and kinetic energy into heat. Thus pinched regions in the jet can be detectable as radiating hotspots and may provide an ideal site for particle acceleration. Pinching also causes gas from the ambient medium to become squeezed between magnetic field lines in the jet, leading to enhanced mass-loading of the jet and potentially contributing to the spine-sheath structure observed in AGN outflows.","Koushik Chatterjee, Matthew Liska, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Sera B.

870,"Regolith on Mars exchanges water with the atmosphere on a diurnal basis and this process causes significant variation in the abundance of water vapor at the surface. While previous studies of regolith-atmosphere exchange focus on the abundance, recent in-situ experiments and remote sensing observations measure the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water. We are therefore motivated to investigate isotopic water exchange between the atmosphere and the regolith and determine its effect on the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of the atmosphere. We model transport of water in the regolith and regolith-atmosphere exchange by solving a transport equation including regolith adsorption, condensation, and diffusion. The model calculates equilibrium fractionation between HDO and H2O in each of these processes. The fractionation in adsorption is caused by the difference in the latent heat of adsorption, and that of condensation is caused by the difference in the vapor pressure. Together with a simple, bulk-aerodynamic boundary layer model, we simulate the diurnal variation of the D/H near the planetary surface. We find that the D/H can vary by 300 - 1400 per mil diurnally in the equatorial and mid-latitude locations, and the magnitude is greater at a colder location or season. The variability is mainly driven by adsorption and desorption of regolith particles, and its diurnal trend features a drop in the early morning, a rise to the peak value during the daytime, and a second drop in the late afternoon and evening, tracing the water vapor flow into and out from the regolith. The predicted D/H variation can be tested with in-situ measurements. As such, our calculations suggest stable isotope analysis to be a powerful tool in pinpointing regolith-atmosphere exchange of water on Mars.",Renyu Hu,Accepted by Earth and Planetary Science Letters,1905.03882v1,No journal ref found,Renyu Hu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03882v1,2019-05-09 22:42:34+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Predicted Diurnal Variation of the Deuterium to Hydrogen Ratio in Water   at the Surface of Mars Caused by Mass Exchange with the Regolith,2019-05-09 22:42:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03882v1

In the next decades third generation observatories are expected to detect hundreds to thousand gravitational wave events from compact binary coalescences with potentially a joint electromagnetic counterpart. In the present work we show how future standard siren detections can be used within the framework of Bayesian model selection to discriminate between cosmological models differing by the parametrization of the late time acceleration. In particular we show that the standard LambdaCDM model can be confirmed or ruled out in case the uncertainty in the gravitational determination of the luminosity distance is reduced with respect to current expectations, e.g. by combining detections from multiple detectors.","Josiel MendonÃ§a, Riccardo Sturani","11 pages, 8 figures",1905.03848v1,No journal ref found,Riccardo Sturani,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03848v1,2019-05-09 21:03:12+00:00,gr-qc,gr-qc|astro-ph.CO,Cosmological model selection from standard siren detections by third   generation gravitational wave obervatories,2019-05-09 21:03:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03848v1

We apply the iterative Lucy-Richardson deconvolution technique to the problem of circumstellar disks to derive disk geometries and surface brightness distributions of the gas. The derived disk parameters are used as input for thermochemical models to test both primordial and cometary scenarios for the origin of the gas.

873,"We present an independent confirmation of the zero-point offset of ${\rm \it Gaia}$ Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes using asteroseismic data of evolved stars in the ${\rm \it Kepler}$ field.

We estimate systematic effects on the inferred global ${\rm \it Gaia}$ parallax offset, $c$, due to radius and temperature systematics, as well as choices in bolometric correction and the adopted form for ${\rm \it Gaia}$ parallax spatial correlations. Because of possible spatially-correlated parallax errors, as discussed by the ${\rm \it Gaia}$ team, our ${\rm \it Gaia}$ parallax offset model is specific to the ${\rm \it Kepler}$ field, but broadly compatible with the magnitude- and color-dependent offset inferred by the ${\rm \it Gaia}$ team and several subsequent investigations using independent methods.","Joel C.

We use this data in the context of Emergent Gravity to predict the ""apparent"" dark matter distribution from the observed baryon distribution, and vice-versa. We find that although the inclusion of the brightest cluster galaxy in the analysis improves the agreement with observations in the inner regions of the clusters ($r \lesssim 10-30$ kpc), at larger radii ($r \sim 100-200$~kpc) the Emergent Gravity predictions for mass profiles and baryon mass fractions are discrepant with observations by a factor of up to $\sim2-6$, though the agreement improves at radii near $r_{500}$.

We model the astrochemical impact of cosmic rays, including those accelerated by protostellar accretion shocks, on molecular clouds hosting protoclusters. Our models with embedded protostars reproduce observed ionization rates. We study the imprint of cosmic ray attenuation on ions for models with different surface cosmic ray spectra and different star formation efficiencies. We find that abundances, particularly ions, are sensitive to the treatment of cosmic rays. We show the column densities of ions are under predicted by the `classic' treatment of cosmic rays by an order of magnitude. We also test two common chemistry approximations used to infer ionization rates. We conclude that the approximation based on the H$_3^+$ abundance under predicts the ionization rate except in regions where the cosmic rays dominate the chemistry. Our models suggest the chemistry in dense gas will be significantly impacted by the increased ionization rates, leading to a reduction in molecules such as NH$_3$ and causing H$_2$-rich gas to become [C II] bright.","Brandt A.

877,"The Earth is a rapidly rotating body. The centrifugal pull makes its shape resemble a flattened ellipsoid and Coriolis forces support waves in its fluid core, known as inertial waves. These waves can lead to global oscillations, or modes, of the fluid. Periodic variations of the Earth's rotation axis (nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and the fluid core and excite these inertial modes. In addition to viscous torques that exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques on the mantle. These torques effectively couple the rigid-body dynamics of the Earth with the fluid dynamics of the fluid core. Here we present the first high resolution numerical model that solves simultaneously the rigid body dynamics of the mantle and the Navier-Stokes equation for the liquid core. This method takes naturally into account dissipative processes in the fluid that are ignored in current nutation models. We find that the Free Core Nutation (FCN) mode, mostly a toroidal fluid flow if the mantle has a large moment of inertia, enters into resonance with nearby modes if the mantle's moment of inertia is reduced. These mode interactions seem to be completely analogous to the ones discovered by Schmitt (2006) in a uniformly rotating ellipsoid with varying flattening.","Santiago Andres Triana, Jeremy Rekier, Antony Trinh, Veronique Dehant","30 pages, 19 figures.

878,"The dynamic quadrupole Love number of Titan measured by \Cassini is $k_\mathrm{2,obs}=0.616\pm 0.067$, strongly indicating a global subsurface ocean. However, the theoretical Love number due to equilibrium tides is at most $k_\mathrm{2,eq}^\mathrm{max}\approx 0.48$ in the absence of an ice shell on top of the ocean. In reality, there is an outer ice shell of thickness $ 100\,\mathrm{km}$, reducing the equilibrium-tide Love number to $k_\mathrm{2,eq}\approx 0.42$. Therefore, other types of tidal response, like dynamic tides, may be also present in Titan. We propose that the ocean is stably stratified. As a result, there exist standing ocean waves (gravity modes) with eigen-frequencies close to the tidal frequency. Such a gravity mode (g-mode) is resonantly excited. It bends the outer ice shell radially and thus enhances the dynamic Love number by $k_\mathrm{2,g}$. In order for $k_\mathrm{2,g}$ to account for the discrepancy between $k_\mathrm{2,eq}$ and $k_\mathrm{2,obs}$, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the ocean is required to be $3.3\times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{rad\, s^{-1}}$. It is compatible with the volatile-rich model for Titan that was proposed to explain the methane-rich atmosphere. The three components of the tidal potential with azimuthal degrees, $m=-2,0,2$, correspond to the three components of the quadrupole Love number, $k_\mathrm{2,-2}$, $k_\mathrm{2,0}$ and $k_\mathrm{2,2}$. They can excite retrograde, axisymmetric and prograde g-modes equally in the absence of rotation. However, Coriolis force induced by Titan's rotation breaks the symmetry among these modes. Most likely, only one of the Love-number components is significantly enhanced by a g-mode, while the other two are still attributed to equilibrium tides. This prediction is testable by observation. If confirmed, the smaller components of the Love number can be used to constrain the thickness of the outer ice shell.",Jing Luan,Comments are welcome.

This model reproduces many of the observed properties of the HI Stream including most of its density profile along its length and its dual filamentary structure. Besides this, ram-pressure combined with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities extracts amounts of ionized and HI gas consistent with those observed. The modeled scenario also reproduces the Magellanic Bridge, including the offset between young and old stars, and the collision between the Clouds, which is responsible of the very elongated morphology of the Small Magellanic Cloud along the line of sight. This model has solved most of the mysteries linked to the formation of the Magellanic Stream. The Leading Arm is not reproduced in the current model because it requires an alternative origin.","Jianling Wang, Francois Hammer, Yanbin Yang, Vincenzo Ripepi, Maria-Rosa L.

880,"The existence of cosmic superstrings may be probed by astronomical time domain surveys. When crossing the line of sight to point-like sources, strings produce a distinctive microlensing signature. We consider two avenues to hunt for a relic population of superstring loops: frequent monitoring of (1) stars in Andromeda, lensed by loops in the haloes of the Milky-Way and Andromeda and (2) supernovae at cosmological distances, lensed by loops in the intergalactic medium. We assess the potential of such experiments to detect and/or constrain strings with a range of tensions, $10^{-15} \lesssim G \mu/c^2 \lesssim 10^{-6}$. The practical sensitivity is tied to cadence of observations which we explore in detail. We forecast that high-cadence monitoring of $\sim 10^5$ stars on the far side of Andromeda over a year-long period will detect microlensing events if $G\mu/c^2 \sim 10^{-13}$, while $\sim 10^6$ stars will detect events if $10^{-13.5} <G\mu/c^2 < 10^{-11.5}$; the upper and lower bounds of the accessible tension range continue to expand as the number of stars rises. We also analyse the ability to reject models in the absence of fluctuations. While challenging, these studies are within reach of forthcoming time-domain surveys. Supernova observations can hypothetically constrain models with $10^{-12} < G\mu/c^2 < 10^{-6}$ without any optimisation of the survey cadence. However, the event rate forecast suggests it will be difficult to reject models of interest. As a demonstration, we use observations from the Pantheon Type Ia supernova cosmology data-set to place modest constraints on the number density of cosmic superstrings in a poorly tested region of the parameter space.","David F.

881,"The discovery of a binary neutron star merger (NSM) through both its gravitational wave and electromagnetic emission has revealed these events to be key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we evaluate the prospects of finding the remnants of Galactic NSMs by detecting the gamma-ray decay lines from their radioactive r-process ejecta. The most promising isotope appears to be $^{126}$Sn, with several lines in the energy range $415 - 695$ keV, because its half-life $t_{1/2} = 2.30(14)\times 10^{5}$ yr is comparable to the ages of the most recent NSMs; as $^{126}$Sn resides close to the second r-process peak, its production in NSMs is also likely to be robust. Using a Monte Carlo procedure, we predict that multiple remnants are detectable as individual sources by next-generation gamma-ray telescopes which achieve sub-MeV line sensitivities of $\sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-6}$ $\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. However, given the unknown locations of the remnants, the most promising search strategy is a systematic survey of the Galactic plane and bulge extending to high Galactic latitudes. Individual known supernova remnants which may be mis-classified NSM remnants could also be targeted, especially those located outside the Galactic plane. Once candidate NSM remnants are identified, the co-detection of gamma-ray lines from $^{230}$Th could shed light on the production yield of heavy actinide nuclei in NSMs. We also investigate the diffuse flux from longer-lived nuclei (e.g. $^{182}$Hf) that could in principle trace the Galactic spatial distribution of NSMs over longer timescales, but find that the detection of the diffuse flux appears challenging even with next-generation telescopes.","Meng-Ru Wu, Projjwal Banerjee, Brian D.

882,"The scattering rate of multi-${\rm TeV}$ and ${\rm PeV}$ energy neutrinos is fast becoming an interesting topic in (astro)particle-physics. This is due to experimental progress at Neutrino Telescopes such as IceCube which have begun to gain sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos in this energy range. In view of this, a precise calculation of the scattering rate of neutrinos upon atoms is presented. The two main components of the calculation are the differential cross-section predictions for neutrino scattering upon an atomic nucleus (such as that of water), as well as upon atomic electrons. In the first case, the predictions for neutrino-nucleus cross-sections in charged- and neutral-current scattering are refined by including resonant contributions generated within the photon field of the nucleus, which alter the considered distributions by $\approx 2\%$. In the latter case, radiative corrections are provided for all $2\to2$ scattering processes of the form $\bar{\nu}_e e^-\to f\bar{f}^{\prime}$. For antineutrino energies of $E_{\bar{\nu}_e}\approx6{\rm~PeV}$, where these processes become resonantly enhanced (the Glashow resonance) and dominate the total cross-section, these corrections amount to $\approx-10\%$.",Rhorry Gauld,"4.5 pages, 3 figures",1905.03792v1,No journal ref found,Rhorry Gauld,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03792v1,2019-05-09 18:00:03+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,Precise predictions for multi-${\rm TeV}$ and ${\rm PeV}$ energy   neutrino scattering rates,2019-05-09 18:00:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03792v1
883,"A natural consequence of the galaxy formation paradigm is the existence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Gravitational perturbations from a massive far away SMBH can induce high orbital eccentricities on dark matter particles orbiting the primary SMBH, via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. This process yields an influx of dark matter particles into the primary SMBH ergosphere, where test particles linger for long timescales. This influx results in high self-gravitating densities, forming a dark matter clump extremely close to the SMBH. In such a situation, the gravitational wave emission between the dark matter clump and the SMBH is potentially detectable by LISA. If dark matter self-annihilates, the high densities of the clump will result in a unique co-detection of gravitational wave emission and high energy electromagnetic signatures.","Smadar Naoz, Joseph Silk","5 pages, 3 figures, submitted",1905.03790v1,No journal ref found,Joseph Silk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03790v1,2019-05-09 18:00:01+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Dark Matter Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries,2019-05-09 18:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03790v1
884,"With a selected sample of neutron star (NS) equation-of-states (EOSs) that are consistent with the current observations and have a range of maximum masses, we investigate the relations between NS gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$, and the relations between the maximum NS mass supported through uniform rotation ($M_{\rm max}$) and that of nonrotating NSs ($M_{\rm TOV}$). We find that if one intends to apply an EOS-independent quadratic, universal transformation formula ($M_b=M_g+A\times M_{g}^2$) to all EOSs, the best fit $A$ value is 0.080 for non-rotating NSs only and 0.073 when different spin periods are considered. The residual error of the transformation is as large as $\sim0.1M_{\odot}$. For different EOSs, we find that the parameter $A$ for non-rotating NSs is proportional to $R_{1.4}^{-1}$ (where $R_{1.4}$ is NS radius for 1.4$M_\odot$ in unit of km). For a particular EOS, if one adopts the best-fit parameters for different spin periods, the residual error of the transformation is smaller, which is of the order of 0.01$M_\odot$ for the quadratic form and less than 0.01$M_\odot$ for the cubic form ($M_b=M_g+A_1\times M_{g}^2+A_2\times M_{g}^3$). We also find a very tight and general correlation between the normalized mass gain due to spin $\Delta m\equiv(M_{\rm max}-M_{\rm TOV})/M_{\rm TOV}$ and the spin period normalized to the Keplerian period ${\cal P}$, i.e. ${\rm log_{10}}\Delta m = (-2.74\pm0.05){\rm log_{10}}{\cal P}+{\rm log_{10}}(0.20\pm 0.01)$, which is independent of EOS models.

885,"Using our new state-of-the-art core-collapse supernova (CCSN) code Fornax, we explore the dependence upon spatial resolution of the outcome and character of three-dimensional (3D) supernova simulations. For the same 19-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor star, energy and radial binning, neutrino microphysics, and nuclear equation of state, changing only the number of angular bins in the $\theta$ and $\phi$ directions, we witness that our lowest resolution 3D simulation does not explode. However, when jumping progressively up in resolution by factors of two in each angular direction on our spherical-polar grid, models then explode, and explode slightly more vigorously with increasing resolution. This suggests that there can be a qualitative dependence of the outcome of 3D CCSN simulations upon spatial resolution. The critical aspect of higher spatial resolution is the adequate capturing of the physics of neutrino-driven turbulence, in particular its Reynolds stress. The greater numerical viscosity of lower-resolution simulations results in greater drag on the turbulent eddies that embody turbulent stress, and, hence, in a diminution of their vigor. Turbulent stress not only pushes the temporarily stalled shock further out, but bootstraps a concomitant increase in the deposited neutrino power. Both effects together lie at the core of the resolution dependence we observe.","Hiroki Nagakura, Adam Burrows, David Radice, David Vartanyan",Submitted to MNRAS,1905.03786v1,No journal ref found,David Vartanyan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03786v1,2019-05-09 18:00:00+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.SR,Towards an Understanding of the Resolution Dependence of Core-Collapse   Supernova Simulations,2019-05-09 18:00:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03786v1
886,"Measuring the temperature and abundance patterns of clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) provides an observational basis for models of the physical conditions within the clouds, which play an important role in studies of star and planet formation. The Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS) is a far ultraviolet rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within diffuse molecular and translucent cloud regions. The final two flights of the instrument observed $\beta^{1}$ Scorpii ($\beta$ Sco) and $\gamma$ Arae. We present flight results of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H$_{\rm 2}$) excitation on the sightlines, including measurements of the column densities and temperatures. These results are compared to previous values that were measured using the damping wings of low J$^{\prime \prime}$ H$_{\rm 2}$ absorption features (Savage et al. 1977). For $\beta$ Sco, we find that the derived column density of the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 rotational level differs by a factor of 2-3 when compared to the previous observations. We discuss the discrepancies between the two measurements and show that the source of the difference is due to the opacity of higher rotational levels contributing to the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 absorption wing, increasing the inferred column density in the previous work. We extend this analysis to 9 $Copernicus$ and 13 $FUSE$ spectra to explore the interdependence of the column densities of different rotational levels and how the H$_{\rm 2}$ kinetic temperature is influenced by these relationships. We find a revised average gas kinetic temperature of the diffuse molecular ISM of T$_{01}$ = 68 $\pm$ 13 K, 12% lower than the value found previously.","Nicholas Kruczek, Kevin France, Keri Hoadley, Brian Fleming, Nicholas Nell","20 pages, 10 Figures, Accepted in ApJ",1905.03781v1,No journal ref found,Nicholas Nell,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03781v1,2019-05-09 17:59:59+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.IM|astro-ph.SR,Revisiting the Temperature of the Diffuse ISM with CHESS Sounding Rocket   Observations,2019-05-09 17:59:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03781v1
887,"We study the significance of non-Gaussianity in the likelihood of weak lensing shear two-point correlation functions, detecting significantly non-zero skewness and kurtosis in one-dimensional marginal distributions of shear two-point correlation functions in simulated weak lensing data though the full multivariate distributions are relatively more Gaussian. We examine the implications in the context of future surveys, in particular LSST, with derivations of how the non-Gaussianity scales with survey area. We show that there is no significant bias in one-dimensional posteriors of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 8}$ due to the non-Gaussian likelihood distributions of shear correlations functions using the mock data ($100$ deg$^{2}$). We also present a systematic approach to constructing an approximate multivariate likelihood function by decorrelating the data points using principal component analysis (PCA). When using a subset of the PCA components that account for the majority of the cosmological signal as a data vector, the one-dimensional marginal likelihood distributions of those components exhibit less skewness and kurtosis than the original shear correlation functions. We further demonstrate that the difference in cosmological parameter constraints between the multivariate Gaussian likelihood model and more complex non-Gaussian likelihood models would be even smaller for an LSST-like survey due to the area effect. In addition, the PCA approach automatically serves as a data compression method, enabling the retention of the majority of the cosmological information while reducing the dimensionality of the data vector by a factor of $\sim$5.","Chien-Hao Lin, Joachim Harnois-DÃ©raps, Tim Eifler, Taylor Pospisil, Rachel Mandelbaum, Ann B.

888,"Ionized outflows are ubiquitous in non radio-loud obscured quasars (QSO2s) at different redshifts. We search for large-scale ionized outflows associated with six optically selected QSO2 (five non-radio-loud and one radio-loud) at $z\sim$ 0.2-0.5, targeting objects with extended radio structures. We have obtained OSIRIS/GTC optical long slit spectroscopy data for these six QSO2 with the slit located along the radio axis. We traced the gas kinematics with the [OIII]$\lambda$4959,5007 lines to investigate ionized outflows and characterize the dynamical state of the host galaxies. This second study has been complemented with previously published FORS2/VLT spectroscopic data of 13 more QSO2 at similar z. We identify ionized outflows in four out of the six QSO2 observed with the GTC. The outflows are spatially unresolved in two QSO2 and compact in a third (radial size of R=0.8$\pm$0.3 kpc). Of particular interest is the radio-quiet QSO2 SDSS 0741+3020 at z=0.47, associated with a giant $\sim$ 112 kpc nebula. An ionized outflow probably induced by the radio structures has been detected along the axis defined by the central $\sim$1\arcsec\ radio structure, extending up to at least $\sim$4 kpc from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Turbulent gas ($\sigma\sim$130 km s$^{-1}$) has also been detected across the giant gas nebula up to $\sim$40 kpc from the AGN. This turbulence may have been induced by outflows triggered by the interaction between a so-far undetected large-scale radio source and the nebula. Regarding the dynamical state of the host galaxies, we find that the majority of the QSO2 show v/$\sigma<$ 1, implying that they are dominated by random motions (so-called dispersion-dominated systems). Most (17 of 19) fall in the area of the E/S0 galaxies in the dynamical diagram v/$\sigma$ versus $\sigma$.

In such a scenario the lightest neutralino mass is approximately $m_\chi \simeq 60$ GeV and the direct Dark Matter detection cross section is naturally below the current bound. In this work we present simple extensions of this scenario that lead to an explanation of the gamma ray excess at the center of the galaxy observed by Fermi-LAT, as well as the anti-proton excess observed by AMS-02. These extensions include the addition of a small CP violating phase in the neutralino sector or the addition of a light CP-odd Higgs scalar.

890,"Sensitive signal processing methods are needed to detect transiting planets from ground-based photometric surveys. Caceres et al. (2019) show that the AutoRegressive Planet Search (ARPS) method --- a combination of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) parametric modeling, a new Transit Comb Filter (TCF) periodogram, and machine learning classification --- is effective when applied to evenly spaced light curves from space-based missions. We investigate here whether ARIMA and TCF will be effective for ground-based survey light curves that are often sparsely sampled with high noise levels from atmospheric and instrumental conditions. The ARPS procedure is applied to selected light curves with strong planetary signals from the Kepler mission that have been altered to simulate the conditions of ground-based exoplanet surveys. Typical irregular cadence patterns are used from the HATSouth survey. We also evaluate recovery of known planets from HATSouth. Simulations test transit signal recovery as a function of cadence pattern and duration, stellar magnitude, planet orbital period and transit depth. Detection rates improve for shorter periods and deeper transits. The study predicts that the ARPS methodology will detect planets with $\gtrsim 0.1$\% transit depth and periods $\lesssim 40$ days in HATSouth stars brighter than $\sim$15 mag. ARPS methodology is therefore promising for planet discovery from ground-based exoplanet surveys with sufficiently dense cadence patterns.","Andrew M. Stuhr, Eric D. Feigelson, Gabriel A.

892,"We calculate the interplanetary magnetic field path lengths traveled by electrons in solar electron events detected by the WIND 3DP instrument from $1994$ to $2016$. The velocity dispersion analysis method is applied for electrons at energies of $\sim$ $27$ keV to $310$ keV. Previous velocity dispersion analyses employ the onset times, which are often affected by instrumental effects and the pre-existing background flux, leading to large uncertainties. We propose a new method here. Instead of using the peak or onset time, we apply the velocity dispersion analysis to the times that correspond to the rising phase of the fluxes that are a fraction, $\eta$, of the peak flux. We perform statistical analysis on selected events whose calculated path lengths have uncertainties smaller than $0.1$ AU. The mean and standard deviation, ($\mu$, $\sigma$), of the calculated path lengths corresponding to $\eta=$ $3/4$, $1/2$, and $1/3$ of the peak flux is ($1.17$ AU, $0.17$ AU), ($1.11$ AU, $0.14$ AU), and ($1.06$ AU, $0.15$ AU). The distribution of the calculated path lengths is also well fitted by a Gaussian distribution for the $\eta=3/4$ and $1/3$ cases. These results suggest that in these electron events the interplanetary magnetic field topology is close to the nominal Parker spiral with little field line meandering. Our results have important implications for particles' perpendicular diffusion.","Lulu Zhao, Gang Li, Ming Zhang, Linghua Wang, Ashraf Moradi, Frederic Effenberger",No comment found,1905.03755v1,No journal ref found,Frederic Effenberger,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03755v1,2019-05-09 17:09:38+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR|astro-ph.EP|physics.space-ph,Statistical analysis of interplanetary magnetic field path lengths from   solar energetic electron events observed by WIND,2019-05-09 17:09:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03755v1
893,"The $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models are nowadays favored by CMB Planck observations. Their similarity with canonical quintessence models motivates the exploration of a common framework that explains both inflation and dark energy. We study the expected constraints that next-generation cosmological experiments will be able to impose for the dark energy $\alpha$-attractor model. We systematically account for the constraining power of SNIa from WFIRST, BAO from DESI and WFIRST, galaxy clustering and shear from LSST and Stage-4 CMB experiments. We assume a tensor-to-scalar ratio, $10^{-3} < r < 10^{-2}$, which permits to explore the wide regime sufficiently close, but distinct, to a cosmological constant, without need of fine tunning the initial value of the field. We find that the combination S4CMB + LSST + SNIa will achieve the best results, improving the FoM by almost an order of magnitude; respect to the S4CMB + BAO + SNIa case. We find this is also true for the FoM of the $w_0 - w_a$ parameters.

894,"MHD waves are ubiquitous in the solar corona where the highly structured magnetic fields provide efficient wave guides for their propagation. While MHD waves have been observed originating from lower layers of the solar atmosphere, recent studies have shown that some can be generated in-situ by the collision of dense counter propagating flows. In this theoretical study, we analyse the mechanism that triggers the propagation of kink and sausage modes in the solar corona, following the collision of counter-propagating flows and how the properties of the flows affect the properties of the generated waves. In order to study in detail such a mechanism we run a series of ideal 2D and 3D MHD simulations where we vary the properties of the counter-propagating flows and by means of a simple technique to estimate the amplitudes of the kink and sausage modes, we investigate their role on the generation and propagation of the MHD waves. We find that the amplitude of the waves is largely dependent on the kinetic energy of the flows and that the onset of kink or sausage modes depends on the asymmetries between the colliding blobs. Moreover, the initial wavelength of the MHD waves is associated with the magnetic configuration resulting from the collision of the flows. We also find that genuine 3D systems respond with smaller wave amplitudes. In this study, we present a parameter space description of the mechanism that leads to the generation of MHD waves from the collision of flows in the corona. Future observations of these waves can be used to understand the properties of the plasma and magnetic field of the solar corona.","P. Pagano, H. J. Van Damme, P. Antolin, I.

METHODS: We performed an imaging and spectral study of the X-ray emission from the PWN G29.4+0.1 using archival observations obtained with the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Public radio continuum and HI data were used to derive distance constraints for the SNR that is linked to G29.37+0.1 and to investigate the interstellar medium where it is expanding. We applied a simple model of the evolution of a PWN inside an SNR to analyze the association between G29.4+0.1 and the radio emission from G29.37+0.1. We compared the spectral properties of the system with the population of TeV PWNe to investigate if HESS J1844-030 is the very high energy counterpart of the X-ray PWN G29.4+0.1. RESULTS: We conclude that G29.4+0.1 is a PWN and that a point source embedded on it is the powering pulsar. The HI data revealed that the SNR linked to G29.37+0.1 is a Galactic source at 6.5 kpc and expanding in a nonuniform medium. From the analysis of the pulsar motion and the pressure balance at the boundary of X-ray emission, we conclude that G29.4+0.1 could be a PWN that is located inside its host remnant, forming a new composite SNR. Based on the magnetic field of the PWN obtained from the X-ray luminosity, we found that the population of electrons producing synchrotron radiation in the keV band can also produce IC photons in the TeV band. This suggests that HESS J1844-030 could be the very high energy counterpart of G29.4+0.1.",Alberto Petriella,"Accepted for publication in A&A. The quality of some of the images

896,"NGC300 ULX1 is an ultra-luminous X-ray pulsar, showing an unprecedented spin evolution, from about 126 s to less than 20 s in only 4 years, consistent with steady mass accretion rate. Following its discovery we have been monitoring the system with Swift/XRT and NICER to further study its properties. We found that even though the observed flux of the system dropped by a factor of $\gtrsim$20, the spin-up rate remained almost constant. A possible explanation is that the decrease in the observed flux is a result of increased absorption of obscuring material due to outflows or a precessing accretion disk.","G. Vasilopoulos, M.

898,"Context. In the near- to mid-infrared wavelength domain, bright continuum sources in the central parsec of the Galactic center (GC) are subject to foreground absorption. These sources therefore represent ideal probes of the intervening material that is responsible for the absorption along the line of sight. Aims. Our aim is to shed light on the location and physics of the absorbing clouds. We try to find out which of the gaseous absorbing materials is intimately associated with the GC and which one is associated with clouds at a much larger distance. Methods. We used the capabilities of CRIRES spectrograph located at ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile to obtain absorption spectra of individual lines at a high spectral resolution of R=65000, that is, 5 km/s. We observed the 12CO R(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), P(5), P(6), P(7) and P(9) transition lines, applied standard data reduction, and compared the results with literature data. Results. We present the results of CRIRES observations of 13 infrared sources located in the central parsec of the Galaxy. The data provide direct evidence for a complex structure of the interstellar medium along the line of sight and in the close environment of the central sources. In particular we find four cold foreground clouds at radial velocities vLS R of the order of -145,-85, -60, and -40+-15 km/s that show absorption in the lower transition lines from R(0) to P(2) and in all the observed spectra.We also find in all sources an absorption in velocity range of 50-60 km/s, possibly associated with the so-called 50 km/s cloud and suggesting an extension of this cloud in front of the GC. Finally, we detect individual absorption lines that are probably associated with material much closer to the center and with the sources themselves, suggesting the presence of cold gas in the local region.","Jihane Moultaka, Andreas Eckart, Kiran Tikare, Armelle Bajat","24 pages, 19 figures, A&A in press",1905.03734v1,No journal ref found,Armelle Bajat,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03734v1,2019-05-09 16:24:47+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,High-spectral resolution M-band observations of CO Rot-Vib absorption   lines towards the Galactic center,2019-05-09 16:24:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03734v1
899,"Aims. To date, more than 600 multi-planetary systems have been discovered. Due to the limitations of the detection methods, our knowledge of the systems is usually far from complete. In particular, for planetary systems discovered with the radial velocity (RV) technique, the inclinations of the orbital planes, and thus the mutual inclinations and planetary masses, are unknown. Our work aims to constrain the spatial configuration of several RV-detected extrasolar systems that are not in a mean-motion resonance. Methods. Through an analytical study based on a first-order secular Hamiltonian expansion and numerical explorations performed with a chaos detector, we identified ranges of values for the orbital inclinations and the mutual inclinations, which ensure the long-term stability of the system. Our results were validated by comparison with n-body simulations, showing the accuracy of our analytical approach up to high mutual inclinations (approx. 70{\deg}-80{\deg}). Results. We find that, given the current estimations for the parameters of the selected systems, long-term regular evolution of the spatial configurations is observed, for all the systems, i) at low mutual inclinations (typically less than 35{\deg}) and ii) at higher mutual inclinations, preferentially if the system is in a Lidov-Kozai resonance. Indeed, a rapid destabilisation of highly mutually inclined orbits is commonly observed, due to the significant chaos that develops around the stability islands of the Lidov-Kozai resonance. The extent of the Lidov-Kozai resonant region is discussed for ten planetary systems (HD 11506, HD 12661, HD 134987, HD 142, HD 154857, HD 164922, HD 169830, HD 207832, HD 4732, and HD 74156).","Mara Volpi, Arnaud Roisin, Anne-Sophie Libert",Accepted for publication in A&A,1905.03722v1,No journal ref found,Anne-Sophie Libert,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03722v1,2019-05-09 15:57:44+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,On the 3D secular dynamics of radial-velocity-detected planetary systems,2019-05-09 15:57:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03722v1
900,"The orbital period distribution of close binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence star (WDMS) is a powerful observational constraint on population synthesis models of the poorly understood common-envelope (CE) interaction. Models have often struggled to reproduce the small number of post-CE WDMS binaries with anomalously long orbital periods greater than $\sim$4 d, though recent studies suggest that in longer period systems recombination energy may help contribute to the efficient ejection of the CE. Planetary nebulae (PNe) are an emerging source of rare long period post-CE binaries which can act as powerful complementary constraints on population synthesis models to more traditional post-CE binary populations. A tentative 9.0 d orbital period was recently proposed for the central star of the PN IC~4776, potentially one of the longest periods observed in post-CE WDMS binaries. Here we present SALT HRS observations of IC~4776 that rule out a 9.0 d orbital period, as well as the previously suggested Wolf-Rayet classification of the primary. The SALT HRS data establish a 3.11 d orbital period and rule out Of and Wolf-Rayet primary spectral types. Assuming a mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ for the primary and an orbital inclination matching the nebula orientation, we find a companion mass of $0.22\pm0.03$ $M_\odot$, most likely corresponding to an M4V companion. The orbital period of IC~4776 is still consistent with findings of abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) studies of post-CE PNe, but any trends in the ADF distribution derived from the sample remain significantly biased by selection effects.","B.

901,"We develop a physically motivated, spherical corona model to investigate the frequency-dependent time lags in AGN. The model includes the effects of Compton up-scattering between the disc UV photons and coronal electrons, and the subsequent X-ray reverberation from the disc. The time lags are associated with the time required for multiple scatterings to boost UV photons up to soft and hard X-ray energies, and the light crossing time the photons take to reach the observer. This model can reproduce not only low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft lags, but also the clear bumps and wiggles in reverberation profiles which should explain the wavy-residuals currently observed in some AGN. Our model supports an anti-correlation between the optical depth and coronal temperatures. In case of an optically thin corona, time delays due to propagating fluctuations may be required to reproduce observed time lags. We fit the model to the lag-frequency data of 1H0707-495, Ark 564, NGC 4051 and IRAS 13224-3809 estimated using the minimal bias technique so that the observed lags here are highest-possible quality. We find their corona size is ~7-15 r_g having the constrained optical depth ~2-10. The coronal temperature is ~150-300 keV. Finally, we note that the reverberation wiggles may be signatures of repeating scatters inside the corona that control the distribution of X-ray sources.","P. Chainakun, A. Watcharangkool, A. J.

902,"Fundamental atomic transition parameters, such as oscillator strengths and wavelengths, play a key role in modelling and understanding the chemical composition of stars in the universe. Despite the significant work under way to produce these parameters for many ions, uncertainties in these parameters remain large and can limit the accuracy of chemical abundance determinations. The Belgian repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS) aims to provide a large systematic and homogeneous quality assessment of the atomic data available for quantitative spectroscopy. BRASS shall compare synthetic spectra against extremely high quality observed spectra, at a resolution of ~85000 and signal-noise ratios of ~1000, for around 20 bright BAFGK spectral type stars, in order to evaluate the atomic data available for over a thousand potentially useful spectral lines. A large-scale homogeneous selection of atomic lines is performed by synthesising theoretical spectra of literature atomic lines, for FGK-type stars including the Sun, resulting in a selection of 1091 theoretically deep and unblended lines, in the wavelength range 4200-6800~\AA, which may be suitable for quality assessment. Astrophysical log(gf) values are determined for the 1091 transitions using two commonly employed methods. The agreement of these log(gf) values are used to select well-behaving lines for quality assessment. 845 atomic lines were found to be suitable for quality assessment, of which 408 were found to be robust against systematic differences between analysis methods. Around 54% of the quality-assessed lines were found to have at least one literature log(gf) value in agreement with our derived values, though the remaining values can disagree by as much as 0.5 dex. Only 38% of FeI lines were found to have sufficiently accurate log(gf) values, increasing to ~70-75% for the remaining Fe-group lines.","M. Laverick, A. Lobel, P. Royer, T. Merle, C. Martayan, P. A.

903,"While the equation of state (EOS) of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) at suprasaturation densities has been relatively well constrained from heavy-ion collisions, the EOS of high-density neutron-rich matter is still largely uncertain due to the poorly known high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the constraints on the EOS of SNM at suprasaturation densities from heavy-ion collisions together with the data of finite nuclei and the existence of $2M_\odot$ neutron stars from electromagnetic (EM) observations, we show that the high-density symmetry energy cannot be too soft, which leads to lower bounds on dimensionless tidal deformability of $\Lambda_{1.4} \ge 193$ and radius of $R_{1.4} \ge 11.1$ km for $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star. Furthermore, we find that the recent constraint of $\Lambda_{1.4} \le 580$ from the gravitational wave signal GW170817 detected from the binary neutron star merger by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations rules out too stiff high-density symmetry energy, leading to an upper limit of $R_{1.4} \le 13.3$ km. All these terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on strong, EM and gravitational measurements together put stringent constraints on the high-density symmetry energy and the EOS of SNM, pure neutron matter and neutron star matter.","Ying Zhou, Lie-Wen Chen, Zhen Zhang","6 pages, 4 figures.

904,"Neutrino-neutrino interactions can lead to collective flavor conversion in the dense parts of a core collapse supernova. Growing instabilities that lead to collective conversions have been studied intensely in the limit of two-neutrino species and occur for inverted mass ordering in the case of a perfectly spherical supernova. We examine two simple models of colliding and intersecting neutrino beams and show, that for three neutrino species instabilities exist also for normal mass ordering even in the case of a fully symmetric system. Whereas the instability for inverted mass ordering is associated with $\Delta m_{31}^2$, the new instability we find for normal mass ordering is associated with $\Delta m_{21}^2$. As a consequence, the growth rate of these new instabilities for normal ordering is smaller by about an order of magnitude compared to the rates of the well studied case of inverted ordering.","Christian DÃ¶ring, Rasmus S.

905,"M-dwarf stars provide very favourable conditions to find habitable worlds beyond our solar system. The estimation of the fundamental parameters of the transiting exoplanets rely on the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for radius and effective temperature of the host M-dwarf, hence the importance of multiple empirical tests of very low-mass star (VLM) models, the theoretical counterpart of M-dwarfs. Recent determinations of mass, radius and effective temperature of a sample of M-dwarfs of known metallicity have disclosed a supposed discontinuity in the effective temperature-radius diagram corresponding to a stellar mass of about 0.2Mo, that has been ascribed to the transition from partially convective to fully convective stars. In this paper we compare existing VLM models to these observations, and find that theory does not predict any discontinuity at around 0.2Mo, rather a smooth change of slope of the effective temperature-radius relationship around this mass value. The appearance of a discontinuity 5is due to naively fitting the empirical data with linear segments. Also, its origin is unrelated to the transition to fully convective structures. We find that this feature is instead an empirical signature for the transition to a regime where electron degeneracy provides an important contribution to the stellar EOS, and constitutes an additional test of the consistency of the theoretical framework for VLM models.","Santi Cassisi, Maurizio Salaris","5 pages, 6 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics in press",1905.03623v1,No journal ref found,Maurizio Salaris,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03623v1,2019-05-09 13:41:01+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,The effective temperature -- radius relationship of M-dwarfs,2019-05-09 13:41:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03623v1
906,"String theory suggests a unique and unambiguous modification to General Relativity: the symmetry of $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ T-duality promotes the entire closed-string massless NS-NS sector to stringy graviton fields. The symmetry fixes the couplings to other matter fields unambiguously and the Einstein field equations are enriched to comprise $D^{2}+1$ components, dubbed recently as the Einstein Double Field Equations. Here we explore the cosmological implications of this `Stringy Gravity'. We derive the most general homogeneous and isotropic ansatzes for both stringy graviton fields and the stringy energy-momentum tensor. Substituting them into the Einstein Double Field Equations, we obtain the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ completion of the Friedmann equations along with a generalized continuity equation. We discuss how this gives an enriched and novel framework beyond typical string cosmology, with solutions that may be characterized by two equation-of-state parameters, $w$ (conventional) and $\lambda$ (new). When $\lambda+3w=1$, the dilaton remains constant throughout the cosmological evolution, and one recovers the standard Friedmann equations for generic matter content (i.e. for any $w$), an improvement over conventional string cosmology where this occurs only for a radiation equation of state ($w=1/3$). We further point out that, in contrast to General Relativity, in Stringy Gravity there is no de Sitter solution arising from either an $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric cosmological constant or scalar field with positive energy density.","Stephen Angus, Kyoungho Cho, Guilherme Franzmann, Shinji Mukohyama, Jeong-Hyuck Park","28 + 12 pages (main body + title, appendix, and references); 1 figure",1905.03620v1,No journal ref found,Jeong-Hyuck Park,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03620v1,2019-05-09 13:36:22+00:00,hep-th,hep-th|astro-ph.CO|gr-qc,"$\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ completion of the Friedmann equations",2019-05-09 13:36:22+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03620v1

Here, we show that baroclinicity appears naturally in the kinetic energy budget after carrying out the appropriate scale decomposition. Strain generation by pressure and density gradients, both barotropic and baroclinic, also results from our analysis. These two processes underlie the recently identified mechanism of ""baropycnal work,"" which can transfer energy across scales in variable density flows. As such, baropycnal work is markedly distinct from pressure-dilatation into which the former is implicitly lumped in Large Eddy Simulations. We provide numerical evidence from 1,024^3 direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence.

909,"The resonant perturbations from planets are able to halt the drag-induced migration, and capture the inwardly drifting planetesimals into mean motion resonances. The equilibrium eccentricity of planetesimals in resonances, and the minimum size of planetesimal that can trigger resonance trapping, have been analyzed and formulated. However, the analytical works based on the assumption that the disk is axisymmetric, which is violated by the asymmetric structures developed by planets. We perform long-term 2D hydrodynamic simulations to study the dynamics of planetesimals in the $j:(j+1)$ first-order exterior resonances, and reexamine the theoretical expressions. We find the expression of equilibrium eccentricity underestimates the values for resonances with $j < 5$, in particular the 1:2 resonance that the underestimation can be $30 - 40\%$. Within the parameter space we explored, we find the equilibrium eccentricity and the minimum size are reduced in an asymmetric disk. The amount of discrepancy in eccentricity depends on the degree of asymmetric structures. For cases of Earth-sized planets, where the disk is less disturbed, the planetesimal's eccentricity can reach to the values predicted by our modified expression. For gaseous planets, however, the eccentricity can be $0.01 - 0.02$ smaller in value. We find the minimum size is 10 times smaller, and the factor seems to be independent of the planet's mass. The influences of asymmetric profiles on the eccentricity and the minimum size could affect the outcome of collisions between resonant and nonresonant planetesimals, and the amount of planetesimals migrated into the planet's feeding zone.","He-Feng Hsieh, Ing-Guey Jiang","14 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication by ApJ",1904.07552v3,No journal ref found,Ing-Guey Jiang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07552v3,2019-04-16 09:32:52+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Long-term Hydrodynamic Simulations on the Planetesimals Trapped in the   First-order Mean Motion Resonances,2019-05-09 12:36:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07552v3
910,"A multi-wavelength analysis of the large Galactic infrared bubble N 24 is has been presented in this paper in order to investigate the molecular and star formation environment around expanding HII regions. Using archival data from Herschel and ATLASGAL, the distribution and physical properties of the dust over the entire bubble are studied. Twenty three dense clumps are identified using the Clumpfind2d algorithm with sizes and masses in the range 0.65-1.73 pc and 600-16300 Msun, respectively. To analyse the molecular environment in N 24, observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) were carried out using the Nanshan 26m radio telescope. Analysis of the kinetic temperature and gravitational stability of these clumps suggests gravitational collapse in several of them. The mass-size distributions of the clumps and the presence of massive young protostars indicate that the shell of N 24 is a region of ongoing massive star formation. The compatibility of the dynamical and fragmentation time-scales and the overabundance of YSOs and clumps on the rim suggest that the collect and collapse mechanism is in play at the boundary of the bubble, but the existence of the IRDC at the edge of bubble indicates that radiation-driven implosion mechanism may also have played a role there.","Xu Li, Jarken Esimbek, Jianjun Zhou, W.

911,"Detection of forming planets means detection of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in reality, since the planet is still surrounded by a disk at this evolutionary stage. Yet, no comprehensive CPD modeling was done in near-infrared wavelengths, where high contrast imaging is a powerful tool to detect these objects. We combined 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of various embedded planets with RADMC-3D radiative transfer post-processing that includes scattering of photons on dust particles. We made synthetic images for VLT NaCo/ERIS in the Ks, L', M' bands as well as examined the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of disks between 1 $\mu m$ and 10 cm. We found that the observed magnitudes from the planet's vicinity will mostly depend on the CPD parameters, not on the planet's. The CPD is 20-100x brighter than the embedded planet in near-IR. We also show how the CPD parameters, e.g. the dust-to-gas ratio will affect the resulting CPD magnitudes. According to the SEDs, the best contrast ratio between the CPD and circumstellar disks is in sub-mm/radio wavelengths and between 8-33 microns in case if the planet opened a resolvable, deep gap ($\ge 5 \rm{M_{Jup}}$), while the contrast is particularly poor in the near-IR. Hence, to detect the forming planet and its CPD, the best chance today is targeting the sub-mm/radio wavelengths and the 10-micron silicate feature vicinity. In order to estimate the forming planet's mass from the observed brightness, it is necessary to run system specific disk modeling.","J. SzulÃ¡gyi, C. P. Dullemond, A. Pohl, S. P.

912,"Solar chromosphere consists of a partially ionized plasma, which makes modeling the solar chromosphere a particularly challenging numerical task. Here we numerically model chromospheric waves using a two-fluid approach with a newly developed numerical code. The code solves two-fluid equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, together with the induction equation, for the case of the purely hydrogen plasma with collisional coupling between the charged and neutral fluid components. The implementation of a semi-implicit algorithm allows us to overcome the numerical stability constraints due to the stiff collisional terms. We test the code against analytical solutions of acoustic and Alfv\'en wave propagation in uniform medium in several regimes of collisional coupling.The results of our simulations are consistent with the analytical estimates, and with other results described in the literature. In the limit of a large collisional frequency, the waves propagate with a common speed of a single fluid. In the other limit of a vanishingly small collisional frequency, the Alfv\'en waves propagate with an Alfv\'en speed of the charged fluid only, while the perturbation in neutral fluid is very small. The acoustic waves in these limits propagate with the sound speed corresponding to either the charges or the neutrals, while the perturbation in the other fluid component is very small. Otherwise, when the collision frequency is similar to the real part of the wave frequency, the interaction between charges and neutrals through momentum transfer collisions cause alterations of the waves frequencies and damping of the wave amplitudes.","B.

For $p-wave suppressed annihilations, constraints from BBN turn out to be significantly stronger than the ones from CMB observations, and are competitive with the strongest bounds from other indirect searches. We furthermore update the lower bound from BBN on the mass of thermal dark matter using improved determinations of primordial abundances.

914,"Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity (EG) describes gravity as an emergent phenomenon rather than a fundamental force. Applying this reasoning in de Sitter space leads to gravity behaving differently on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales; this excess gravity might offer an alternative to dark matter. Here we test these ideas using the data from the Coma cluster and from 58 stacked galaxy clusters. The X-ray surface brightness measurements of the clusters at $0.1 < z < 1.2$ along with the weak lensing data are used to test the theory. We find that the simultaneous EG fits of the X-ray and weak lensing datasets are significantly worse than those provided by General Relativity (with cold dark matter). For the Coma cluster, the predictions from Emergent Gravity and General Relativity agree in the range of 250 - 700 kpc, while at around 1 Mpc scales, EG total mass predictions are larger by a factor of 2. For the cluster stack the predictions are only in good agreement at around the 1 - 2 Mpc scales, while for $r \gtrsim 10$ Mpc EG is in strong tension with the data. According to the Bayesian information criterion analysis, GR is preferred in all tested datasets; however, we also discuss possible modifications of EG that greatly relax the tension with the data.","Andrius Tamosiunas, David Bacon, Kazuya Koyama, Robert C.

916,"SPICA, the cryogenic infrared space telescope recently pre-selected for a `Phase A' concept study as one of the three remaining candidates for ESA's fifth medium class (M5) mission, is foreseen to include a far-infrared polarimetric imager (SPICA-POL, now called B-BOP), which would offer a unique opportunity to resolve major issues in our understanding of the nearby, cold magnetized Universe. This paper presents an overview of the main science drivers for B-BOP, including high dynamic range polarimetric imaging of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in both our Milky Way and nearby galaxies. Thanks to a cooled telescope, B-BOP will deliver wide-field 100-350 micron images of linearly polarized dust emission in Stokes Q and U with a resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and both intensity and spatial dynamic ranges comparable to those achieved by Herschel images of the cold ISM in total intensity (Stokes I). The B-BOP 200 micron images will also have a factor ~30 higher resolution than Planck polarization data. This will make B-BOP a unique tool for characterizing the statistical properties of the magnetized interstellar medium and probing the role of magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of the interstellar web of dusty molecular filaments giving birth to most stars in our Galaxy. B-BOP will also be a powerful instrument for studying the magnetism of nearby galaxies and testing galactic dynamo models, constraining the physics of dust grain alignment, informing the problem of the interaction of cosmic rays with molecular clouds, tracing magnetic fields in the inner layers of protoplanetary disks, and monitoring accretion bursts in embedded protostars.","Ph.

917,"Observations of Neptune, made in 2018 using the new Narrow Field Adaptive Optics mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) from 0.48 - 0.93 micron, are analysed here to determine the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity and methane abundance in Neptune's observable troposphere (0.1 - ~3 bar). Previous observations at these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011, Icarus 205, 674-694) found that the mole fraction of methane above the cloud tops (at ~2 bar) varied from ~4% at equatorial latitudes to ~2% at southern polar latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths near 825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H2-H2/H2-He collision-induced absorption. We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane abundance in 2018, which suggests that this depletion of methane towards Neptune's pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term upwelling at mid-equatorial latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By analysing these MUSE observations along the central meridian with a retrieval model, we demonstrate that a broad boundary between the nominal and depleted methane abundances occurs at between 20 - 40S. We also find a small depletion of methane near the equator, perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local enhancement near 60 - 70S, which we suggest may be associated with South Polar Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune's atmosphere at these latitudes. Finally, by the use of both a reflectivity analysis and a principal component analysis, we demonstrate that this depletion of methane towards the pole is apparent at all locations on Neptune's disc, and not just along its central meridian.","Patrick G.

918,"Satellite galaxies in galaxy clusters represent a significant fraction of the global galaxy population. Because of the unusual dense environment of clusters, their evolution is driven by different mechanisms than the ones affecting field or central galaxies. Understanding the different interactions they are subject to, and how they are influenced by them, is therefore an important step towards explaining the global picture of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we use the publicly-available high resolution hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-1 to study satellite galaxies in the three most massive host haloes (with masses $M_{200} > 10^{14}\,h^{-1}\rm{M}_{\odot}$) at $z=0$. We measure the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (hereafter SHMR) of the galaxies, and find that for satellites it is shifted towards lower halo masses compared to the SHMR of central galaxies. We provide simple fitting functions for both the central and satellite SHMR. To explain the shift between the two, we follow the satellite galaxies since their time of accretion into the clusters, and quantify the impact of dark matter stripping and star formation. We find that subhaloes start losing their dark matter as soon as they get closer than $\sim 1.5\times R_{\rm{vir}}$ to the centre of their host, and that up to 80\% of their dark matter content gets stripped during infall. On the other hand, star formation quenching appears to be delayed, and galaxies continue to form stars for a few Gyr after accretion. The combination of these two effects impacts the ratio of stellar to dark matter mass which varies drastically during infall, from 0.03 to 0.3.","Anna Niemiec, Eric Jullo, Carlo Giocoli, Marceau Limousin, Mathilde Jauzac","14 pages, 12 figures",1811.04996v3,No journal ref found,Mathilde Jauzac,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04996v3,2018-11-12 20:42:00+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA|astro-ph.CO,Dark matter stripping in galaxy clusters: a look at the Stellar to Halo   Mass relation in the Illustris simulation,2019-05-09 10:12:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04996v3

920,"The Borexino detector measures solar neutrino fluxes via neutrino-electron elastic scattering. Observed spectra are determined by the solar-$\nu_{e}$ survival probability $P_{ee}(E)$, and the chiral couplings of the neutrino and electron. Some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model postulate the existence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI's) which modify the chiral couplings and $P_{ee}(E)$. In this paper, we search for such NSI's, in particularly neutral-current-like interactions that modify the $\nu_e - e$ and $\nu_\tau - e$ couplings, using Borexino Phase II data. Standard Solar Model predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes for both high- and low-metallicity assumptions are considered. No indication of new physics is found at the level of sensitivity of the detector and constraints on the parameters of the NSI's are placed.

921,"The background evolution of an accelerated, dark energy dominated universe is aptly described by non-canonical tachyon scalar field models. The accelerated expansion of the universe is determined by the choice of a suitable scalar field potential; in the case of a tachyon field, a 'runaway' potential. In the absence of a fundamental theory, dark energy properties are studied in a phenomenological approach. This includes determining the model parameters using observations and to probe the allowed deviation from the cosmological constant model. In this paper, we present constraints on tachyon scalar field parameters from low redshift data for two different scalar field potentials. These scalar field potentials have been crucial in tachyon dark energy studies. The datasets considered in this paper include the supernova type Ia data, independent measurements of the Hubble parameter and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. In this paper, we present constraints on tachyon field parameters using these observations and their combination. A combination of the datasets indicates that those model parameters are preferred which emulate the cosmological constant model. The initial value of the scalar field, in the unit of the Hubble constant, is bounded from below and does not require fine-tuning at larger values.","Avinash Singh, Archana Sangwan, H. K.

922,"Decades of studies have suggested several criteria to detect Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) in time series from in-situ spacecraft measurements. Among them the most common are an enhanced and smoothly rotating magnetic field, a low proton temperature and a low plasma beta. However, these features are not all observed for each ICME due to their strong variability. Visual detection is time-consuming and biased by the observer interpretation leading to non exhaustive, subjective and thus hardly reproducible catalogs. Using convolutional neural networks on sliding windows and peak detection, we provide a fast, automatic and multi-scale detection of ICMEs. The method has been tested on the in-situ data from WIND between 1997 and 2015 and on the 657 ICMEs that were recorded during this period. The method offers an unambiguous visual proxy of ICMEs that gives an interpretation of the data similar to what an expert observer would give. We found at a maximum 197 of the 232 ICMEs of the 2010-2015 period (recall 84 +-4.5 % including 90% of the ICMEs present in the lists of Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2015) and Chi et al. (2016). The minimal number of False Positives was 25 out of 158 predicted ICMEs (precision 84+-2.6%). Although less accurate, the method also works with one or several missing input parameters. The method has the advantage of improving its performance by just increasing the amount of input data. The generality of the method paves the way for automatic detection of many different event signatures in spacecraft in-situ measurements.","Gautier Nguyen, Nicolas Aunai, Dominique Fontaine, Erwan Le Pennec, Joris Van den Bossche, Alexis Jeandet, Brice Bakkali, Louis Vignoli, Bruno Regaldo-Saint Blancard",No comment found,1903.10780v2,No journal ref found,Bruno Regaldo-Saint Blancard,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10780v2,2019-03-26 10:27:34+00:00,astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.SR,Automatic detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections from   in-situ data: a deep learning approach,2019-05-09 09:09:56+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10780v2
923,"Joint gravitational-wave detections of stellar-mass black-hole binaries by ground- and space-based observatories will provide unprecedented opportunities for fundamental physics and astronomy. We present a semianalytic method to estimate multiband event rates by combining selection effects of ground-based interferometers (like LIGO/Virgo) and space missions (like LISA). We forecast the expected number of multiband detections first by using information from current LIGO/Virgo data, and then through population synthesis simulations of binary stars. We estimate that few to tens of LISA detections can be used to predict mergers detectable on the ground. Conversely, hundreds of events could potentially be extracted from the LISA data stream using prior information from ground detections. In general, the merger signal of binaries observable by LISA is strong enough to be unambiguously identified by both current and future ground-based detectors. Therefore third-generation detectors will not increase the number of multiband detections compared to LIGO/Virgo. We use population synthesis simulations of isolated binary stars to explore some of the stellar physics that could be constrained with multiband events, and we show that specific formation pathways might be overrepresented in multiband events compared to ground-only detections.","Davide Gerosa, Sizheng Ma, Kaze W.

924,"The magnetic field of magnetars may be twisted compared with that of normal pulsars. Previous works mainly discussed magnetic energy release in the closed field line regions of magnetars. For a twisted magnetic field, the field lines will inflate in the radial direction. Similar to normal pulsars, the idea of light cylinder radius is introduced. More field lines will cross the light cylinder and become open for a twisted magnetic field. Therefore, magnetars may have a large polar cap, which may correspond to the hot spot during outburst. Particle flow in the open field line regions will result in the untwisting of the magnetic field. Magnetic energy release in the open field line regions can be calculated. The model calculations can catch the general trend of magnetar outburst decay: decreasing X-ray luminosity, shrinking hot spot etc. For magnetic energy release in the open field line regions, the geometry will be the same for different outburst in one magnetar.",H.

925,"Strangeon is proposed to be the constituent of bulk strong matter, as an analogy of nucleon for an atomic nucleus. The nature of both nucleon matter (2 quark flavors, u and d) and strangeon matter (3 flavors, u, d and s) is controlled by the strong-force, but the baryon number of the former is much smaller than that of the latter, to be separated by a critical number of $A_{\rm c}\sim 10^9$. While micro nucleon matter (i.e., nuclei) is focused by nuclear physicists, astrophysical/macro strangeon matter could be manifested in the form of compact stars (strangeon star), cosmic rays (strangeon cosmic ray), and even dark matter (strangeon dark matter). This trinity of strangeon matter is explained, that may impact dramatically on today's physics.",Renxin Xu,typos corrected,1904.11153v2,No journal ref found,Renxin Xu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11153v2,2019-04-25 04:20:12+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|hep-lat|nucl-th,Trinity of Strangeon Matter,2019-05-09 07:30:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11153v2
926,"It has long been suggested that nearby pulsars within $\sim 1 \,{\rm kpc}$ are the leading candidate of the 10-500 GeV cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and other experiments. The recent measurement of surface brightness profile of TeV nebulae surrounding Geminga and PSR~B0656+14 by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) suggests inefficient diffusion of particles from the sources, giving rise to a debate on the pulsar interpretation of the cosmic-ray positron excess. Here we argue that GeV observations provide more direct constraints on the positron density in the TeV nebulae in the energy range of 10-500 GeV and hence on the origin of the observed positron excess. Motivated by this, we search for GeV emission from the TeV nebulae with the \textsl{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). No spatially-extended GeV emission is detected from these two TeV nebulae in the framework of two-zone diffusion spatial templates, suggesting a relatively low density of GeV electrons/positrons in the TeV nebulae. A joint modelling of the data from HAWC and \textsl{Fermi}-LAT disfavors Geminga and PSR~B0656+14 as the dominant source of the positron excess at $\sim 50-500$ GeV for the usual Kolmogorov-type diffusion, while for an energy-independent diffusion, a dominant part of the positron excess contributed by them cannot be ruled out by the current data.","Shao-Qiang Xi, Ruo-Yu Liu, Zhi-Qiu Huang, Kun Fang, Xiang-Yu Wang","26 pages, 11 figures, significantly expanded, to appear in ApJ",1810.10928v3,No journal ref found,Xiang-Yu Wang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10928v3,2018-10-25 15:29:32+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE|astro-ph.CO|hep-ph,GeV observations of the extended pulsar wind nebulae constrain the   pulsar interpretations of the cosmic-ray positron excess,2019-05-09 07:30:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10928v3
927,"We present the results of a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in the data from the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We search for gravitational-wave transients with a duration of milliseconds to approximately one second in the 32-4096 Hz frequency band with minimal assumptions about the signal properties, thus targeting a wide variety of sources. We also perform a matched-filter search for gravitational-wave transients from cosmic string cusps for which the waveform is well-modeled. The unmodeled search detected gravitational waves from several binary black hole mergers which have been identified by previous analyses. No other significant events have been found by either the unmodeled search or the cosmic string search. We thus present search sensitivity for a variety of signal waveforms and report upper limits on the source rate-density as function of the characteristic frequency of the signal. These upper limits are a factor of three lower than the first observing run, with a $50\%$ detection probability for gravitational-wave emissions with energies of $\sim10^{-9}M_\odot c^2$ at 153 Hz. For the search dedicated to cosmic string cusps we consider several loop distribution models, and present updated constraints from the same search done in the first observing run.","The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, B.

928,"We reassess the relationship between the photospheric magnetic field strength and the Ca II K intensity for a variety of surface features as a function of the position on the disc and the solar activity level. This relationship can be used to recover the unsigned photospheric magnetic field from images recorded in the core of Ca II K line. We have analysed 131 pairs of high-quality, full-disc, near-co-temporal observations from SDO/HMI and Rome/PSPT spanning half a solar cycle. To analytically describe the observationally-determined relation, we considered three different functions: a power law with an offset, a logarithmic function, and a power law function of the logarithm of the magnetic flux density. We used the obtained relations to reconstruct maps of the line-of-sight component of the unsigned magnetic field (unsigned magnetograms) from Ca II K observations, which were then compared to the original magnetograms. We find that both power-law functions represent the data well, while the logarithmic function is good only for quiet periods. We see no significant variation over the solar cycle or over the disc in the derived fit parameters, independently of the function used. We find that errors in the independent variable, usually not accounted for, introduce attenuation bias. To address this, we binned the data with respect to the magnetic field strength and Ca II K contrast separately and derived the relation for the bisector of the two binned curves. The reconstructed unsigned magnetograms show good agreement with the original ones. RMS differences are less than 90 G. The results were unaffected by the stray-light correction of the SDO/HMI and Rome/PSPT data. Our results imply that Ca~II~K observations, accurately processed and calibrated, can be used to reconstruct unsigned magnetograms by using the relations derived in our study.","Theodosios Chatzistergos, Ilaria Ermolli, Sami K.

929,"The extended jet structures of radio galaxies (RGs) represent an ideal acceleration site for High Energy Cosmic Rays (HECRs) and a recent model showed that the HECR data can be explained by these sources, if the arrival directions of HECRs at energies $\lesssim 8\,\text{EeV}$ from a certain RG, Cygnus A, are isotropized.   First, this work introduces the inverted simulation setup in order to probe the isotropy assumption. Here, different extragalactic magnetic field models are compared showing that either a magnetic field of primordial origin that yields a high field strength in the large scale structures of the Universe is needed, or a significant contribution by a multitude of isotropically distributed sources.   Secondly, the HECRs contribution by the bulk of RGs of different Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type is determined. Here, the most recent FR-type dependent radio-to-CR correlations $Q_{\rm cr}\propto L_{\rm radio}^{\beta_L}$ are used, and the impact of the slope $\beta_L$ on the HECRs is analyzed in detail. Finally, it is carved out that FR-II RGs provide a promising spectral behavior at the hardening part of the CR flux, between about $3\,\text{EeV}$ and $30\,\text{EeV}$, but most likely not enough CR power. At these energies, FR-I RGs can only provide an appropriate flux in the case of a high acceleration efficiency and $\beta_L\gtrsim 0.9$, otherwise these sources rather contribute below $3\,\text{EeV}$. Further, the required acceleration efficiency for a significant HECR contribution is exposed dependent on $\beta_L$ and the CR spectrum at the acceleration site.",BjÃ¶rn Eichmann,No comment found,1902.00309v2,No journal ref found,BjÃ¶rn Eichmann,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00309v2,2019-02-01 12:55:36+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,High Energy Cosmic Rays from Fanaroff-Riley Radio Galaxies,2019-05-09 06:31:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00309v2
930,"We present direct spectroscopic modeling of 44 Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) using spectral synthesis code SYNAPPS. We confirm detections of helium emission in the early-time spectra of two SNe Iax: SNe 2004cs and 2007J. These He I features are better fit by a pure-emission Gaussian than by a P-Cygni profile, indicating that the helium emission originates from the circumstellar environment rather than the SN ejecta. Based on the modeling of the remaining 42 SNe Iax, we find no obvious helium features in other SN Iax spectra. However, $\approx 76\%$ of our sample lack sufficiently deep luminosity limits to detect helium emission with a luminosity of that seen in SNe 2004cs and 2007J. Using the objects with constraining luminosity limits, we calculate that 33% of SNe Iax have detectable helium in their spectra. We examine 11 SNe Iax with late-time spectra and find no hydrogen or helium emission from swept up material. For late-time spectra, we calculate typical upper limits of stripped hydrogen and helium to be $2 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. While detections of helium in SNe Iax support a white dwarf-He star binary progenitor system (i.e., a single-degenerate [SD] channel), non-detections may be explained by variations in the explosion and ejecta material. The lack of helium in the majority of our sample demonstrates the complexity of SN Iax progenitor systems and the need for further modeling. With strong independent evidence indicating that SNe Iax arise from a SD channel, we caution the common interpretation that the lack of helium or hydrogen emission at late-time in SN Ia spectra rules out SD progenitor scenarios for this class.","Wynn Jacobson-Galan, Ryan Foley, Josiah Schwab, Georgios Dimitriadis, Shawfeng Dong, Saurabh Jha, Daniel Kasen, Charles Kilpatrick, Rollin Thomas","43 pages, 55 figures.

931,"If the dark matter is made of ultra-light axions, stable solitonic cores form at the centers of virialized halos. In some range for the mass $m$ of the axion particle, these cores are sufficiently compact and can mimic supermassive black holes (SMBH) residing at galactic nuclei. We use the solitonic core--halo mass relation, validated in numerical simulations, to constrain a new range of allowed axion mass from measurements of the SMBH mass in (pseudo)bulge and bulgeless galaxies. These limits are based on observations of galactic nuclei on scales smaller than 10 pc. Our analysis strongly suggests that $m < 10^{-18}$ eV is ruled out by the data.

932,"We report the discovery of a radio transient in the spiral galaxy M81. The transient was detected in early 2015 as part of a two-year survey of M81 made up of 12 epochs using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. While undetected on 2014 September 12, the source was first detected on 2015 January 2, from which point it remained visible at an approximately constant luminosity of $L_{R} = 1.5 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{24}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at the observing frequency of 6 GHz for at least 2 months. Assuming this is a synchrotron event with a rise-time between 2.6 and 112 days, the peak luminosity (at equipartition) corresponds to a minimum energy of $10^{44} \lesssim E_{min} \lesssim 10^{46}$erg and jet power of $P_{min} \sim 10^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$, which are higher than most known X-ray binaries. Given its longevity, lack of short-term radio variability, and the absence of any multi-wavelength counterpart (X-ray luminosity $L_{X} \lesssim 10^{36}$erg s$^{-1}$), it does not behave like known Galactic or extragalactic X-ray binaries. The M81 transient radio properties more closely resemble the unidentified radio transient 43.78+59.3 discovered in M82, which has been suggested to be a radio nebula associated with an accreting source similar to SS 433. One possibility is that both the new M81 transient and the M82 transient may be the birth of a short-lived radio bubble associated with a discrete accretion event similar to those observed from the ULX Holmberg II X-1. However, it is not possible to rule out other identifications including long-term supernova shockwave interactions with the surrounding medium from a faint supernova or a background active galaxy.","G.

This conclusion is devised within modified weak-field General Relativity where the accelerated expansion of the Universe and the dynamics of galaxy groups and clusters are described by the same parameter, the cosmological constant.

We assume that the dark matter potential is spherically symmetric, characterized by a scale radius and scale density, and the velocity distribution is isotropic. We find that the effect of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation is largely determined by dimensional analysis; the angular size of gamma-ray emission from an individual subhalo is rescaled by a factor which depends on the form of the dark matter distribution, but not on the halo parameters, while the relative normalization of the gamma-ray flux from different mass subhalos is rescaled by a factor which depends on the halo parameters, but not on the form of the dark matter distribution.

935,"We derive an anthropic bound on the extra neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, based on the observation that a positive $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ suppresses the growth of matter fluctuations due to the prolonged radiation dominated era, which reduces the fraction of matter that collapses into galaxies, hence, the number of observers. We show that the probability of finding ourselves in a universe satisfying the current bound is of order a few percents for a flat prior distribution. If $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is found to be close to the current upper bound or the value suggested by the $H_0$ tension, the anthropic explanation is not very unlikely. On the other hand, if the upper bound on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is significantly improved by future observations, such simple anthropic consideration does not explain the small value of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. We also study simple models where dark radiation consists of relativistic particles produced by heavy scalar decays, and show that the prior probability distribution sensitively depends on the number of the particle species.","Fuminobu Takahashi, Masaki Yamada","14 pages, 4 figures; V2: Added references",1904.12864v2,No journal ref found,Masaki Yamada,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12864v2,2019-04-29 18:00:03+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|hep-ph|hep-th,Anthropic Bound on Dark Radiation and its Implications for Reheating,2019-05-09 03:21:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12864v2
936,"Understanding gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae will be essential for their detection with current and future gravitational wave detectors. This requires a sample of waveforms from modern 3D supernova simulations reaching well into the explosion phase, where gravitational wave emission is expected to peak. However, recent waveforms from 3D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport do not reach far into the explosion phase, and some are still obtained from non-exploding models. We therefore calculate waveforms up to 0.9\,s after bounce using the neutrino hydrodynamics code \textsc{CoCoNuT-FMT}. We consider two models with low and normal explosion energy, namely explosions of an ultra-stripped progenitor with an initial helium star mass of $3.5\,M_{\odot}$, and of an $18\,M_{\odot}$ single star. Both models show gravitational wave emission from the excitation of surface g-modes in the proto-neutron star with frequencies between $\mathord{\sim}800\,\mathrm{Hz}$ and 1000\,Hz at peak emission. The peak amplitudes are about $6\, \mathrm{cm}$ and $10\, \mathrm{cm}$, respectively, which is somewhat higher than in most recent 3D models of the pre-explosion or early explosion phase. Using a Bayesian analysis, we determine the maximum detection distances for our models in simulated Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and Einstein Telescope design sensitivity noise. The more energetic $18 M_\odot$ explosion will be detectable to about $17.5 \,\mathrm{kpc}$ by the LIGO/Virgo network and to about $180\, \mathrm{kpc}$ with the Einstein Telescope.","Jade Powell, Bernhard MÃ¼ller",No comment found,1812.05738v2,No journal ref found,Bernhard MÃ¼ller,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05738v2,2018-12-13 23:59:36+00:00,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.HE,Gravitational Wave Emission from 3D Explosion Models of Core-Collapse   Supernovae with Low and Normal Explosion Energies,2019-05-09 03:08:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05738v2
937,"YZ Phe is a very short-period contact binary (Sp.= $K2\,V$) with an orbital period of 0.2347 days near the short period limit (0.22 d). We present the complete light curves in $VRI$ bands, which photometric data were obtained with the 0.61-m telescope of PROMPT-8 at CTIO in Chile during June to October 2016 and August 2017. The photometric solutions were determined by using the W-D method and the results reveal that YZ Phe is a W-subtype shallow contact binary ($f\sim$ 10%, $q$ = 2.635 or $1/q$ = 0.379 for W subtype) with rotational motion of a large hot spot on the more massive component, showing a strong O'Connell effect with variation of maxima in photometric time series at period of 4.20 yr and stellar cycle at period of 1.28 yr. By compiling all available eclipse times, the result shows a long-term period decrease at a rate of $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -2.64(\pm 0.02)\times 10^{-8}$ d $yr^{-1}$, superimposed on a cyclic variation ($A_3$ = 0.0081 days and $P_3$ = 40.76 years). This variation cannot be explained by Applegate mechanism. Thus, the cyclic change may be interpreted as light-travel time effect via the presence of a cool third body. Based on photometric solutions, the third light was detected with 2% contribution of total light in $V$ and $I$ bands. Those support the existence of a third body. For the long-term period decrease, it can be explained by mass transfer from the more massive component ($M_2 \sim 0.74 M_{\odot}$) to the less massive one ($M_1 \sim 0.28 M_{\odot}$) or plus AML via magnetic braking. With $1/q$ $<$ 0.4 and long-term period decrease, all suggest that YZ Phe is on the AML-controlled state and its fill-out factor will increase, as well as the system will evolve into a deeper normal contact binary.","T.

938,"Lorentz invariance violations (LIV) can yield vacuum birefringence, which results in an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization vector of linearly polarized emission from astrophysical sources. It is believed that if the relative rotation angle ($\Delta\Theta$) of the polarization vector of high energy photons with respect to that of low energy photons is larger than $\pi/2$, then the net polarization of the signal would be significantly depleted and could not be as high as the observed level. Hence, the measurement of high polarization implies that $\Delta\Theta$ should not be too large. In this work, we assemble recent detections of prompt emission polarization in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), all of whom have high detection significance. Following the method shown in Lin et al. (2016), we give a detailed calculation on the polarization evolution arising from the LIV effect for each GRB, and confirm that, even if $\Delta\Theta$ is approaching to $\pi/2$, the net polarization is not severely suppressed, and more than 60\% of the initial polarization can be conserved. Applying this method to our GRB polarimetric data, we improve existing sensitivities to LIV involving photons by factors ranging from two to ten.

939,"We offer a standing wave explanation for the observed excess proper motions at the center of the globular cluster 47-Tucanae, amounting to $\simeq 0.5\%$ of the total mass.

We propose this core develops from dark matter captured in the deep gravitational potential of this globular cluster as it orbits the dark halo of our galaxy. This boson may be evidence for a second light axion, additional to a lighter boson of $10^{-22}eV$, favored for the dominant dark matter implied by the large dark cores of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

940,"The scaling of reaction yields in light ion fusion to low reaction energies is important for our understanding of stellar fuel chains and the development of future energy technologies. Experiments become progressively more challenging at lower reaction energies due to the exponential drop of fusion cross sections below the Coulomb barrier. We report on experiments where deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reactions are studied in a pulsed plasma in the glow discharge regime using a benchtop apparatus. We model plasma conditions using particle-in-cell codes. Advantages of this approach are relatively high peak ion currents and current densities (0.1 to several A/cm^2) that can be applied to metal wire cathodes for several days. We detect neutrons from D-D reactions with scintillator-based detectors. For palladium targets, we find neutron yields as a function of cathode voltage that are over 100 times higher than yields expected for bare nuclei fusion at ion energies below 2 keV (center of mass frame). A possible explanation is a correction to the ion energy due to an electron screening potential of 1000+/-250 eV, which increases the probability for tunneling through the repulsive Coulomb barrier.

To examine and calibrate the theoretical $I_{\rm 7.0}/I_{\rm 6.7}$--$T_{\rm max}$--$M_{\rm WD}$ relations, reliable measurements of $T_{\rm max}$ and $I_{\rm 7.0}/I_{\rm 6.7}$ are necessary.

942,"The Galactic Center (GC) is dominated by the gravity of a super-massive black hole (SMBH), Sagittarius A$^*$, and is suspected to contain a sizable population of binary stars. Such binaries form hierarchical triples with the SMBH, undergoing Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) evolution, which can lead to high eccentricity excitations for the binary companions' mutual orbit. This effect can lead to stellar collisions or Roche-lobe crossings, as well as orbital shrinking due to tidal dissipation. In this work we investigate the dynamical and stellar evolution of such binary systems, especially with regards to the binaries' post-main-sequence evolution. We find that the majority of binaries (~75%) is eventually separated into single stars, while the remaining binaries (~25%) undergo phases of common-envelope evolution and/or stellar mergers. These objects can produce a number of different exotic outcomes, including rejuvenated stars, G2-like infrared-excess objects, stripped giant stars, Type Ia supernovae (SNe), cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotic binaries (SBs), or compact object binaries. We estimate that, within a sphere of 250 Mpc radius, about 7.5 to 15 Type Ia SNe per year should occur in galactic nuclei due to this mechanism, potentially detectable by ZTF and ASAS-SN. Likewise we estimate that, within a sphere of 1 Gpc$^3$ volume, about 10 to 20 compact object binaries form per year that could become gravitational wave sources. Based on results of EKL-driven compact object binary mergers in galactic nuclei by Hoang at al. (2018), this compact object binary formation rate translates to about 15 to 30 events per year detectable by Advanced LIGO.","Alexander P. Stephan, Smadar Naoz, Andrea M. Ghez, Mark R.

943,"We present spatially resolved millimeter maps of Neptune between 95 and 242 GHz taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in $2016-2017$. The millimeter weighting functions peak between 1 and 10 bar on Neptune, lying in between the altitudes probed at visible/infrared and centimeter wavelengths. Thus, these observations provide important constraints on the atmospheric structure and dynamics of Neptune.   We identify seven well-resolved latitudinal bands of discrete brightness temperature variations, on the order of $0.5-3$K in all three observed ALMA spectral bands. We model Neptune's brightness temperature using the radiative transfer code Radio-BEAR and compare how various H$_2$S, CH$_4$, and \textit{ortho/para} H$_2$ abundance profiles can fit the observed temperature variations across the disk. We find that observed variations in brightness temperature with latitude can be explained by variations in the H$_2$S profile that range from sub- to super-saturations at altitudes above the 10-bar pressure level, while variations in CH$_4$ improve the quality of fit near the equator. At the south polar cap, our best fit model has a depleted deep atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S from 30 to only 1.5 times the protosolar value, while simultaneously depleting the CH$_4$ abundance. This pattern of enhancement and depletion of condensable species is consistent with a global circulation structure where enriched air rises at the mid-latitudes ($32^{\circ}-12^{\circ}$S) and north of the equator ($2^{\circ}-20^{\circ}$N), and dry air descends at the poles ($90^{\circ}-66^{\circ}$S) and just south of the equator ($12^{\circ}$S$-2^{\circ}$N). Our analysis finds more complex structure near the equator than accounted for in previous circulation models.","Joshua Tollefson, Imke de Pater, Statia Luszcz-Cook, David DeBoer","21 pages, 17 Figures, accepted into the Astronomical Journal May,

944,"Two recent observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 with NuSTAR, one simultaneous with an XMM-Newton observation, provide an opportunity to examine its population of bright accreting sources from a broadband perspective. We study the three known ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the galaxy, and find that ULX-1 and ULX-2 have very steep power-law spectra with $\Gamma=3.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ in both cases. Their properties are consistent with being super-Eddington accreting sources with the majority of their hard emission obscured and down-scattered. ULX-3 (NGC 6946 X-1) is significantly detected by both XMM-Newton and NuSTAR at $L_{\rm X}=(6.5\pm0.1)\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and has a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma=2.51\pm0.05$. We are unable to identify a high-energy break in its spectrum like that found in other ULXs, but the soft spectrum likely hinders our ability to detect one. We also characterise the new source, ULX-4, which is only detected in the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation, at $L_{\rm X}=(2.27\pm0.07)\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and is absent in a Chandra observation ten days later. It has a very hard cut-off power-law spectrum with $\Gamma=0.7\pm0.1$ and $E_{\rm cut}=11^{+9}_{-4}$ keV. We do not detect pulsations from ULX-4, but its transient nature can be explained either as a neutron star ULX briefly leaving the propeller regime or as a micro-tidal disruption event induced by a stellar-mass compact object.","Hannah P.

945,"We present the UNIT $N$-body cosmological simulations project, designed to provide precise predictions for nonlinear statistics of the galaxy distribution. We focus on characterizing statistics relevant to emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. We use a suite of precise particle mesh simulations (FastPM) as well as with full $N$-body calculations with a mass resolution of $\sim 1.2\times10^9\,h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the recently suggested technique of Angulo & Pontzen 2016 to suppress the variance of cosmological simulations We study redshift space distortions, cosmic voids, higher order statistics from $z=2$ down to $z=0$. We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased. Over the scales of interest for baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, we find that the variance is greatly reduced in the two-point statistics and in the cross correlation between halos and cosmic voids, but is not reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey with effective volume of 20 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ is improved by about a factor of 40, indicating that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ lead to the equivalent variance of $\sim$150 such simulations. The $N$-body simulations presented here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of DESI or Euclid.

947,"Spectroscopy for 247 stars towards the young cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud has been combined with that for 116 targets from the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. Spectral classification yields a sample of 47 O-type and 287 B-type spectra, while radial-velocity variations and/or spectral multiplicity have been used to identify 45 candidate single-lined systems, 17 double-lined systems, and one triple-lined system. Atmospheric parameters (T$_eff$ and log$g$) and projected rotational velocities ($v_e$sin$i$) have been estimated using TLUSTY model atmospheres; independent estimates of $v_e$sin$i$ were also obtained using a Fourier Transform method. Luminosities have been inferred from stellar apparent magnitudes and used in conjunction with the T$_eff$ and $v_e$sin$i$ estimates to constrain stellar masses and ages using the BONNSAI package. We find that targets towards the inner region of NGC 346 have higher median masses and projected rotational velocities, together with smaller median ages than the rest of the sample. There appears to be a population of very young targets with ages of less than 2 Myr, which have presumably all formed within the cluster. The more massive targets are found to have lower $v_e$sin$i$ consistent with previous studies. No significant evidence is found for differences with metallicity in the stellar rotational velocities of early-type stars, although the targets in the SMC may rotate faster than those in young Galactic clusters. The rotational velocity distribution for single non-supergiant B-type stars is inferred and implies that a significant number have low rotational velocity ($\simeq$10\% with $v_e$<40 km/s), together with a peak in the probability distribution at $v_e \simeq$300 km/s. Larger projected rotational velocity estimates have been found for our Be-type sample and imply that most have rotational velocities between 200-450 km/s.","P. L. Dufton, C. J. Evans, I. Hunter, D.

The scope of the present work is to make the first extensive quantitative analysis of the photospheric magnetic field and photospheric vertical electric current (PVEC) dynamics in the PIL region using new vector magnetograms obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) with high temporal resolution of 135 s. Data analysis revealed sharp changes of the magnetic structure and PVEC associated with the flare onset near the PIL. It was found that the strongest plasma heating and electron acceleration were associated with the largest increase of the magnetic reconnection rate, total PVEC and effective PVEC density in the flare ribbons. Observations and non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations have shown that the magnetic field structure around the PIL is consistent with the tether-cutting magnetic reconnection (TCMR) geometry. We gave qualitative interpretation of the observed dynamics of the flare ribbons, magnetic field and PVEC, and electron acceleration, within the TCMR scenario.","I. N. Sharykin, I. V. Zimovets, I. I.

951,"Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect the make-up of the final cohort. We propose a new algorithm, Entrofy, designed to be part of a larger decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, quantitative, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest this algorithm be embedded in a two-step selection procedure. First, all application materials are stripped of markers of identity that could induce conscious or sub-conscious bias. During blind review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and software tool. Entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include gender, academic discipline, experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The Entrofy algorithm yields the computational maximization of diversity by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show how Entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study. This cohort selection process allows human judgment to prevail when assessing merit, but assigns the assessment of diversity to a computational process less likely to be beset by human bias. Importantly, the stage at which diversity assessments occur is fully transparent and auditable with Entrofy. Splitting merit and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected.","D. Huppenkothen, B. McFee, L.

952,"We show that a black hole surrounded by scalar dark matter develops scalar hair. This is the generalization of a phenomenon pointed out by Jacobson, that a minimally coupled scalar with a non-trivial time dependence far away from the black hole would endow the black hole with hair. In our case, the time dependence arises from the oscillation of a scalar field with a non-zero mass. We systematically explore the scalar profile around the black hole for different scalar masses. In the small mass limit, the scalar field has a $1/r$ component at large radius $r$, consistent with Jacobson's result. In the large mass limit (with the Compton wavelength of order of the horizon or smaller), the scalar field has a $1/r^{3/4}$ profile yielding a pile-up close to the horizon, while distinctive nodes occur for intermediate masses. Thus, the dark matter profile around a black hole, while challenging to measure, contains information about the dark matter particle mass. As an application, we consider the case of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, recently imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope. Its horizon size is roughly the Compton wavelength of a scalar particle of mass $10^{-20}$ eV. We consider the implications of the expected scalar pile-up close to the horizon, for fuzzy dark matter at a mass of $10^{-20}$ eV or below.","Lam Hui, Daniel Kabat, Xinyu Li, Luca Santoni, Sam S. C.

953,"The distribution of three dimensional intrinsic galaxy shapes has been a longstanding open question. The difficulty stems from projection effects meaning one must rely on statistical methods applied to galaxy samples to infer intrinsic shape distributions. Theoretical work using analytical galaxy potentials suggests a relationship between galaxy intrinsic shape (as defined by its ""triaxiality"", in practice a proxy for how prolate a galaxy is) and the intrinsic misalignment angle between kinematic and morphological axes ($\Psi_{\rm int}$). This relationship reduces the number of unknowns, providing more reliable inferred intrinsic shape distributions than methods using photometry alone. Here we explore the connection between intrinsic shape and stellar kinematics using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. The strongest relationship we find is that galaxy intrinsic flattening is correlated with specific angular momentum (j) with high j galaxies being flatter than galaxies with low specific angular momentum. Our analysis shows that, although the majority of kinematically misaligned galaxies exhibit prolate shapes, examples of kinematically aligned prolate galaxies are also present. Clearly a direct correspondence between prolate shape and minor-axis rotation (often referred to as ""prolate rotation"") is not present in Illustris. Thus, we demonstrate that the assumption of a simple relationship between $\Psi_{\rm int}$ and intrinsic shape commonly employed in shape recovery studies is not valid for Illustris galaxies. We suggest improvements on the method as well as some alternative methods for future work in this area.","Robert Bassett, Caroline Foster","18 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",1905.03306v1,No journal ref found,Caroline Foster,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03306v1,2019-05-08 19:17:05+00:00,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.GA,Prospects for Recovering Galaxy Intrinsic Shapes from Projected   Quantities,2019-05-08 19:17:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03306v1

CLU-\ha~has imaged $\approx$3$\pi$ of the sky (26,470~deg$^2$) with 4 narrow-band filters that probe a distance out to 200~Mpc. We have obtained spectroscopic follow-up for galaxy candidates in 14 preliminary fields (101.6~deg$^2$) to characterize the limits and completeness of the survey. In these preliminary fields, CLU can identify emission lines down to an \ha~flux limit of $10^{-14}$~$\rm{erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ at 90\% completeness, and recovers 83\% (67\%) of the \ha~flux from catalogued galaxies in our search volume at the $\Sigma$=2.5 ($\Sigma$=5) color excess levels. The contamination from galaxies with no emission lines is 61\% (12\%) for $\Sigma$=2.5 ($\Sigma$=5). Also, in the regions of overlap between our preliminary fields and previous emission-line surveys, we recover the majority of the galaxies found in previous surveys and identify an additional $\approx$300 galaxies. In total, we find 90 galaxies with no previous distance information, several of which are interesting objects: 7 blue compact dwarfs, 1 green pea, and a Seyfert galaxy; we also identified a known planetary nebula. These objects show that the CLU-\ha~survey can be a discovery machine for objects in our own Galaxy and extreme galaxies out to intermediate redshifts. However, the majority of the CLU-\ha~galaxies identified in this work show properties consistent with normal star-forming galaxies.

956,"It has been recently argued \cite{Barvinsky:2017lfl} that the de Sitter phase in cosmology might be naturally generated as a result of dynamics of the topologically nontrivial sectors in a strongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory in expanding universe. It is known that the de Sitter phase is realized in the history of our Universe twice: the first occurrence is coined as the inflation, while the second time (which is occurring now) is dubbed as the dark energy (DE). The crucial element of the proposal \cite{Barvinsky:2017lfl} is the presence of a nontrivial gauge holonomy which is the source of the vacuum energy leading to the de Sitter behaviour. It has been also argued that the anomalous coupling of the system with the Standard Model (SM) particles leads to the reheating epoch in case of the {\it inflationary} phase. A similar anomalous coupling of the system with the Maxwell $E\&M$ field during the {\it DE epoch} generates the cosmological magnetic field.

This information about the newly-discovered variables, along with the photometric data is freely available on-line. In this paper, we analyze ASAS-SN data on two small random samples of pulsating red giants (PRGs) in detail, and compare our results with those found by ASAS-SN. For the majority of a sample of 29 mostly semi-regular (SR) PRGs, the ASAS-SN results are incorrect or incomplete: either the ASAS-SN periods are 2, 3, or 4 times the actual period, or the ASAS-SN period is a ""long secondary period"" with a shorter pulsation present, or the star is multi-periodic or otherwise complex, or the star's data are contaminated by instrumental effects.

Our results are not surprising, given the very complex behavior of PRGs.","John R.

958,"Next-generation radio surveys will yield an unprecedented amount of data, warranting analysis by use of machine learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks are the deep learning technique that has proven to be the most successful in classifying image data. Capsule networks are a more recently developed technique that use capsules comprised of groups of neurons, that describe properties of an image including the relative spatial locations of features. The current work explores the performance of different capsule network architectures against simpler convolutional neural network architectures, in reproducing the classifications into the classes of unresolved, FRI and FRII morphologies. We utilise images from a LOFAR survey which is the deepest, wide-area radio survey to date, revealing more complex radio-source structures compared to previous surveys, presenting further challenges for machine learning algorithms. The 4- and 8-layer convolutional networks attain an average precision of 93.3% and 94.3% respectively, compared to 89.7% obtained with the capsule network, when training on original and augmented images. Implementing transfer learning achieves a precision of 94.4%, that is within the confidence interval of the 8-layer convolutional network. The convolutional networks always outperform any variation of the capsule network, as they prove to be more robust to the presence of noise in images. The use of pooling appears to allow more freedom for the intra-class variability of radio galaxy morphologies, as well as reducing the impact of noise.","V. Lukic, M. BrÃ¼ggen, B. Mingo, J. H.

959,"The growth channel of massive galaxies involving mergers can be studied via close pairs as putative merger progenitors, where the stellar populations of the satellite galaxies will be eventually incorporated into the massive primaries. We extend our recent analysis of the GAMA-based sample of close pairs presented in Ferreras et al. to the general spectroscopic dataset of SDSS galaxies (DR14), for which the high S/N of the data enables a detailed analysis of the differences between satellite galaxies with respect to the mass of the primary galaxy. A sample of approximately two thousand satellites of massive galaxies is carefully selected within a relatively narrow redshift range (0.07<z<0.14). Two main parameters are considered as major drivers of the star formation history of these galaxies, namely: the stellar velocity dispersion of the satellite ($\sigma$), as a proxy of ""local"" drivers, and the ratio between the stellar mass of the satellite and the primary, $\mu=M_{\rm SAT}/M_{\rm PRI}$, meant to serve as an indicator of environment. Consistently with the independent, GAMA-based work, we find that satellites around the most massive primaries appear older, at fixed velocity dispersion, with respect to satellites of lower mass primaries. This trend is more marked in lower mass satellites ($\sigma$~100 km/s), with SSP-equivalent age differences up to ~0.5 Gyr, and can be interpreted as a one-halo assembly bias, so that satellites corresponding to smaller values of the mass ratio $\mu$ represent older structures, akin to fossil groups.","Ignacio Ferreras, Andrew M.

960,"We present a model where the inflaton can naturally account for all the dark matter in the Universe within the warm inflation paradigm. In particular, we show that the symmetries of the Warm Little Inflaton scenario (i) avoid large thermal and radiative corrections to the scalar potential, (ii) allow for sufficiently strong dissipative effects to sustain a radiation bath during inflation that becomes dominant at the end of the slow-roll regime, and (iii) enable a stable inflaton remnant in the post-inflationary epochs. The latter behaves as dark radiation until parametrically before matter-radiation equality, leading to a non-negligible contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom during nucleosynthesis, becoming the dominant cold dark matter component in the Universe for inflaton masses in the $10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ eV range. Cold dark matter isocurvature perturbations, anti-correlated with the main adiabatic component, provide a smoking gun for this scenario that can be tested in the near future.","Joao G. Rosa, Luis B.

961,"Radial velocities of fifteen double-mode bulge RR Lyrae (RR01) stars are presented, six of which belong to a compact group of RR01 stars in pulsation space, with the ratio of first-overtone period to fundamental-mode period, P_{fo}/P_{f}~0.74, and P_{f}~0.44. It has been suggested that these pulsationally clumped RR01 stars are a relic of a disrupted dwarf galaxy or stellar cluster, as they also appear to be spatially coherent in a vertical strip across the bulge. However, the radial velocities of the stars presented here, along with proper motions from Gaia DR2, show a large range of radial velocities, proper motions and distances for the bulge RR01 stars in the pulsation clump, much larger than the RR01 stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Therefore, in contrast to the kinematics of the RRL stars belonging to Sgr, and those in and surrounding the bulge globular cluster NGC~6441, there is no obvious kinematic signature within the pulsationally clumped RR01 stars. If the pulsationally clumped RR01 stars belonged to the same system in the past and were accreted, their accretion in the inner Galaxy was not recent, as the kinematic signature of this group has been lost (i.e., these stars are now well-mixed within the inner Galaxy). We show that the apparent spatial coherence reported for these stars could have been caused by small number statistics. The orbits of the RR01 stars in the inner Galaxy suggest they are confined to the innermost ~4~kpc of the Milky Way.","Andrea Kunder, Alex Tilton, Dylon Maertens, Jonathan Ogata, David Nataf, R.

962,"We study the internal radial gradients of the stellar populations in a sample comprising 522 early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the SAMI (Sydney- AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph) Galaxy Survey. We stack the spectra of individual spaxels in radial bins, and derive basic stellar population properties: total metallicity ([Z/H]), [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe] and age. The radial gradient ($\nabla$) and central value of the fits (evaluated at R$_e$/4) are compared against a set of six possible drivers of the trends. We find that velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) - or, equivalently gravitational potential - is the dominant driver of the chemical composition gradients. Surface mass density is also correlated with the trends, especially with stellar age. The decrease of $\nabla$[Mg/Fe] with increasing $\sigma$ is contrasted by a rather shallow dependence of $\nabla$[Z/H] with $\sigma$ (although this radial gradient is overall rather steep). This result, along with a shallow age slope at the massive end, imposes stringent constraints on the progenitors of the populations that contribute to the formation of the outer envelopes of ETGs. The SAMI sample is split between a 'field' sample and a cluster sample. Only weak environment-related differences are found, most notably a stronger dependence of central total metallicity ([Z/H]$_{e4}$) with $\sigma$, along with a marginal trend of $\nabla$[Z/H] to steepen in cluster galaxies, a result that is not followed by [Mg/Fe].

963,"(Abridged) Any viable cosmological model in which galaxies interact predicts the existence of primordial and tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). In particular, in the standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM), according to the dual dwarf galaxy theorem, there must exist both primordial dark matter-dominated and dark matter-free TDGs with different radii. We study the frequency, evolution, and properties of TDGs in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use the hydrodynamical cosmological Illustris-1 simulation to identify tidal dwarf galaxy candidates (TDGCs) and study their present-day physical properties. We also present movies on the formation of a few galaxies lacking dark matter, confirming their tidal dwarf nature. TDGCs can however also be formed via other mechanisms, such as from ram-pressure-stripped material or, speculatively, from cold-accreted gas. We find 97 TDGCs with $M_{stellar} >5 \times 10^7 M_\odot$ at redshift $z = 0$, corresponding to a co-moving number density of $2.3 \times 10^{-4} h^3 cMpc^{-3}$. The most massive TDGC has $M_{total} = 3.1 \times 10^9 M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. TDGCs are phase-space-correlated, reach high metallicities, and are typically younger than dark matter-rich dwarf galaxies. We report for the first time the verification of the dual dwarf theorem in a self-consistent $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation. Simulated TDGCs and dark matter-dominated galaxies populate different regions in the radius-mass diagram in disagreement with observations of early-type galaxies. The dark matter-poor galaxies formed in Illustris-1 have comparable radii to observed dwarf galaxies and to TDGs formed in other galaxy-encounter simulations. In Illustris-1, only 0.17% of all selected galaxies with $M_{stellar} = 5 \times 10^7-10^9 M_\odot$ are TDGCs or dark matter-poor dwarf galaxies. The occurrence of NGC 1052-DF2-type objects is discussed.","Moritz Haslbauer, Joerg Dabringhausen, Pavel Kroupa, Behnam Javanmardi, Indranil Banik","Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 28 pages, 26

964,"We present a systematic study of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in M83 and its effects on the measurement of metallicity gradients at varying resolution scales. Using spectrophotometric data cubes of M83 obtained at the 2.5m duPont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory as part of the TYPHOON program, we separate the HII regions from the DIG using the [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio, HIIphot (HII finding algorithm) and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness. We find that the contribution to the overall H$\alpha$ luminosity is approximately equal for the HII and DIG regions. The data is then rebinned to simulate low-resolution observations at varying resolution scales from 41 pc up to 1005 pc. Metallicity gradients are measured using five different metallicity diagnostics at each resolution. We find that all metallicity diagnostics used are affected by the inclusion of DIG to varying degrees. We discuss the reasons of why the metallicity gradients are significantly affected by DIG using the HII dominance and emission line ratio radial profiles. We find that applying the [SII]/H$\alpha$ cut will provide a closer estimate of the true metallicity gradient up to a resolution of 1005 pc for all metallicity diagnostics used in this study.","Henry Poetrodjojo, Joshua J.

965,"We present new determinations of disk surface density, independent of an assumed dust opacity, for a sample of 7 bright, diverse protoplanetary disks using measurements of disk dust lines. We develop a robust method for determining the location of dust lines by modeling disk interferometric visibilities at multiple wavelengths. The disks in our sample have newly derived masses that are 9-27% of their host stellar mass, substantially larger than the minimum mass solar nebula. All are stable to gravitational collapse except for one which approaches the limit of Toomre-Q stability. Our mass estimates are 2-15 times larger than estimates from integrated optically thin dust emission. We derive depleted dust-to-gas ratios with typical values of ~$10^{-3}$ in the outer disk. Using coagulation models we derive dust surface density profiles that are consistent with millimeter dust observations. In these models, the disks formed with an initial dust mass that is a factor of ~10 greater than is presently observed. Of the three disks in our sample with resolved CO line emission, the masses of HD 163296, AS 209, and TW Hya are roughly 3, 115, and 40 times more massive than estimates from CO respectively. This range indicates that CO depletion is not uniform across different disks and that dust is a more robust tracer of total disk mass. Our method of determining surface density using dust lines is robust even if particles form as aggregates and is useful even in the presence of dust substructure caused by pressure traps. The low Toomre-Q values observed in this sample indicate that at least some disks do not accrete efficiently.","Diana Powell, Ruth Murray-Clay, Laura M. PÃ©rez, Hilke E.

In the present work, we investigate the modified GW form propagation from the inspiraling of compact binary systems within the context of $f(T)$ gravity in order to obtain new forecasts/constraints on the free parameter of the theory. First, we show that the modified waveform differs from the GR waveform essentially due to induced corrections on the GW amplitude. Then, we discuss the forecasts on the $f(T)$ gravity assuming simulated sources of GWs as black hole binaries, neutron star binaries and black hole - neutron star binary systems, which emit GWs in the frequency band of the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) interferometer and of the third generation Einstein Telescope (ET). We show that GWs sources detected within the aLIGO sensitivity can return estimates of the same order of magnitude of the current cosmological observations. On the other hand, detections within the ET sensitivity can improve by up to 2 orders of magnitude the current bound on the $f(T)$ gravity. Therefore, the statistical accuracy that can be achieved by future ground based GW observations, mainly with the ET detector (and planed detectors with a similar sensitivity), can allow strong bounds on the free parameter of the theory, and can be decisive to test the theory of gravitation.","Rafael C.

969,"We present 247-GHz molecular line observations of methanol (CH$_3$OH) toward sixteen massive star-forming regions, using the APEX telescope with an angular resolution of $25''$. The sample covers a range of evolutionary states, including warm molecular cores, hot molecular cores, and ultracompact HII regions. The hot cores, all of which include UC HII regions, show rich molecular line spectra, although the strength of different species and transitions varies from source to source. In contrast, the warm cores do not show significant molecular line emission. Multiple methanol transitions are detected toward nine of the hot cores; eight of these had enough transitions to use the rotation diagram method to estimate rotational temperatures and column densities. The temperatures lie in the range 104$-$168 K and column densities from $3\times10^{16}$ to $7\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. Using the average methanol line parameters, we estimate virial masses, which fall in the range from 145 to 720 M$_\odot$ and proved to be significantly higher than the measured gas masses. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the chemical differences between hot cores and warm molecular cores.

Contrary to MSS, in this paper we show that, generically, all SVT modes are coupled to each other at the quadratic level of the action.

971,"w-Projection is a wide-field imaging technique that is widely used in radio synthesis arrays. Processing the wide-field big data generated by the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will require significant updates to current methods to significantly reduce the time consumed on data processing. Data loading and gridding are found to be two major time-consuming tasks in w-projection. In this paper, we investigate two parallel methods of accelerating w-projection processing on multiple nodes: the hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) method based on multicore Central Processing Units (CPUs) and the hybrid MPI and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) method based on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Both methods are successfully employed and operated in various computational environments, confirming their robustness. The experimental results show that the total runtime of both MPI + OpenMP and MPI + CUDA methods is significantly shorter than that of single-thread processing. MPI + CUDA generally shows faster performance when running on multiple nodes than MPI + OpenMP, especially on large numbers of nodes. The single-precision GPU-based processing yields faster computation than the double-precision processing; while the single- and doubleprecision CPU-based processing shows consistent computational performance. The gridding time remarkably increases when the support size of the convolution kernel is larger than 8 and the image size is larger than 2,048 pixels.

973,"Counting experiments often rely on Monte Carlo simulations for predictions of Poisson expectations. The accompanying uncertainty from the finite Monte Carlo sample size can be incorporated into parameter estimation by modifying the Poisson likelihood. We first review previous Frequentist methods of this type by Barlow et al, Bohm et al, and Chirkin, as well as recently proposed probabilistic methods by the author and Arg\""uelles et al. We show that all these approaches can be understood in a unified way: they all approximate the underlying probability distribution of the sum of weights in a given bin, the compound Poisson distribution (CPD). The Probabilistic methods marginalize the Poisson mean with a distribution that approximates the CPD, while the Frequentist counterparts optimize the same integrand treating the mean as a nuisance parameter. With this viewpoint we can motivate three new probabilistic likelihoods based on generalized gamma-Poisson mixture distributions which we derive in analytic form. Afterwards, we test old and new formulas in different parameter estimation settings consisting of a ""background"" and ""signal"" dataset. The probablistic counterpart to the Ansatz by Barlow et al. outperforms all other existing approaches in various scenarios. We further find a surprising outcome: usage of the exact CPD is actually bad for parameter estimation. A continuous approximation performs much better and in principle allows to perform bias-free inference at any level of simulated livetime if the first two moments of the CPD of each dataset are known exactly.

974,"We report our identification of the optical afterglow and host galaxy of the short-duration gamma-ray burst sGRB 160821Bb. The spectroscopic redshift of the host is $z=0.162$, making it one of the lowest redshift sGRBs identified by Swift. Our intensive follow-up campaign using a range of ground-based facilities as well as HST, XMM and Swift, shows evidence for a late-time excess of optical and near-infrared emission in addition to a complex afterglow. The afterglow light-curve at X-ray frequencies reveals a narrow jet, $\theta_j\sim1.9$ deg, that is refreshed at $>1$ day post-burst by a slower outflow with significantly more energy than the initial outflow that produced the main GRB. Observations of the 5 GHz radio afterglow shows a reverse shock into a mildly magnetised shell. The optical and near-infrared excess is fainter than AT2017gfo associated with GW170817, and is well explained by a kilonova with dynamic ejecta mass $M_{\rm dyn}=(2.0\pm1.2)\times10^{-3}$\,M$_{\odot}$ and a secular ejecta mass with $M_{\rm pm}= 1.0\pm0.6)\times10^{-2}$\,M$_\odot$, consistent with a binary neutron star merger resulting in a short-lived massive neutron star.

975,"We are witness to a great and increasing interest in internal structure, composition and evolution of exoplanets. However, direct measurements of exoplanetary mass and radius cannot be uniquely interpreted in terms of interior structure, justifying the need for an additional observable. The second degree fluid Love number, $k_2$, is proportional to the concentration of mass towards the body's center, hence providing valuable additional information about the internal structure. When hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed for the planetary interior, $k_2$ is a direct function of the planetary shape. Previous attempts were made to link the observed tidally and rotationally induced planetary oblateness in photometric light curves to $k_2$ using ellipsoidal shape models. Here, we construct an analytical 3D shape model function of the true planetary mean radius, that properly accounts for tidal and rotational deformations. Measuring the true planetary mean radius is critical when one wishes to compare the measured $k_2$ to interior theoretical expectations. We illustrate the feasibility of our method and show, by applying a Differential Evolution Markov Chain to synthetic data of WASP-121b, that a precision $\leq$ 65 ppm/$\sqrt{2\,min}$ is required to reliably retrieve $k_2$ with present understanding of stellar limb darkening, therefore improving recent results based on ellipsoidal shape models. Any improvement on stellar limb darkening would increase such performance.","Hugo Hellard, SzilÃ¡rd Csizmadia, Sebastiano Padovan, Heike Rauer, Juan Cabrera, Frank Sohl, Tilman Spohn, Doris Breuer",Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal,1905.03171v1,No journal ref found,Doris Breuer,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03171v1,2019-05-08 15:56:05+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP,Retrieval of the fluid Love number $k_2$ in exoplanetary transit curves,2019-05-08 15:56:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03171v1
976,"We have mapped the G287.84-0.82 cometary globule (with the Treasure Chest cluster embedded in it) in the South Pillars region of Carina (i) in [CII], 63micron [OI], and CO(11-10) using upGREAT on SOFIA and (ii) in J=2-1 transitions of CO, 13CO, C18O and J=3-2 transitions of H2CO using the APEX telescope in Chile. We probe the morphology, kinematics, and physical conditions of the molecular gas and the photon dominated regions (PDRs) in G287.84-0.82. The [CII] and [OI] emission suggest that the overall structure of the pillar (with red-shifted photo evaporating tails) is consistent with the effect of FUV radiation and winds from eta-Car and O stars in Trumpler 16. The gas in the head of the pillar is strongly influenced by the embedded cluster, whose brightest member is an O9.5V star, CPD-59 2661. The emission of the [CII] and [OI] lines peak at a position close to the embedded star, while all other tracers peak at another position lying to the north-east consistent with gas being compressed by the expanding PDR created by the embedded cluster. The molecular gas inside the globule is probed with the J=2-1 transitions of CO and isotopologues as well as H2CO, and analyzed using a non-LTE model (escape-probability approach), while we use PDR models to derive the physical conditions of the PDR. We identify at least two PDR gas components; the diffuse part (~10^4 cm^-3) is traced by [CII], while the dense (n~ 2-8x10^5 cm^-3) part is traced by [CII], [OI], CO(11-10). Using the F=2-1 transition of [13CII] detected at 50 positions in the region, we derive optical depths (0.9-5), excitation temperatures of [CII] (80-255 K), and N(C+) of 0.3-1x10^19 cm^-2. The total mass of the globule is ~1000 Msun, about half of which is traced by [CII]. The dense PDR gas has a thermal pressure of 10^7-10^8 K cm^-3, which is similar to the values observed in other regions.","B. Mookerjea, G. Sandell, R. Guesten, D. Riquelme, H. Wiesemeyer, E.

977,"The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of protoplanetary disks are strongly subject to the non-ideal MHD effects arising from the low ionization fraction of the disk gas. A strong electric field induced by gas motions can heat ionized gas particles and can thereby affect the ionization balance in the disks. Our previous studies revealed that in dusty protoplanetary disks, the Ohmic conductivity decreases with increasing electric field strength until the electrical breakdown of the disk gas occurs. In this study, we extend our previous work to more general cases where both electric and magnetic fields affect the motion of plasma particles, allowing us to study the impacts of plasma heating on all non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic, Hall, and ambipolar diffusion. We find that the upper limit on the electric current we previously derived applies even in the presence of magnetic fields. Although the Hall and ambipolar resistivities can either increase or decrease with electric field strength depending on the abundance of charged dust grains, the Ohmic resistivity always increases with electric field strength. An order-of-magnitude estimate suggests that a large-scale electric current generated by gas motions in the inner part of protoplanetary disks could exceed the upper limit. This implies that MHD motions of the inner disk, such as the motion driven by the Hall-shear instability, could either get suppressed or trigger electrical breakdown (lightning discharge). This may have important implications for gas accretion and chondrule formation in the inner part of protoplanetary disks.","Satoshi Okuzumi, Shoji Mori, Shu-ichiro Inutsuka","16 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.03153v1,No journal ref found,Shu-ichiro Inutsuka,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03153v1,2019-05-08 15:29:36+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR|physics.plasm-ph,The Generalized Nonlinear Ohm's Law: How a Strong Electric Field   Influences Non-ideal MHD Effects in Dusty Protoplanetary Disks,2019-05-08 15:29:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03153v1
978,"The source X 1822-371 is an eclipsing compact binary system with a period close to 5.57 hr and an orbital period derivative $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ of 1.51(7)$\times 10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$. The very large value of $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ is compatible with a super-Eddington mass transfer rate from the companion star, as suggested by X-ray and optical data. The XMM-Newton observation taken in 2017 allows us to update the orbital ephemeris and verify whether the orbital period derivative has been stable over the last 40 yr. We added to the X-ray eclipse arrival times from 1977 to 2008 two new values obtained from the RXTE and XMM-Newton observations performed in 2011 and 2017, respectively. We estimated the number of orbital cycles and the delays of our eclipse arrival times spanning 40 yr using as reference time the eclipse arrival time obtained from the Rossi-XTE observation taken in 1996. Fitting the delays with a quadratic model, we found an orbital period $P_{\rm orb}=5.57062957(20)$ hr and a $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ value of $1.475(54) \times 10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$. The addition of a cubic term to the model does not significantly improve the quality of the fit. We also determined a spin-period value of $P_{\rm spin}=0.5915669(4)$ s and its first derivative $\dot{P}_{\rm spin}= -2.595(11) \times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. The obtained results confirm the scenario of a super-Eddington mass transfer rate; we also exclude a gravitational coupling between the orbit and the change in the oblateness of the companion star triggered by the nuclear luminosity of the companion star.","S.

981,"Recent (sub)millimeter polarimetric observations toward the young star HL Tau have successfully detected polarization emission from its circumstellar disk. The polarization pattern observed at 0.87 mm is uniform and parallel to the disk's minor axis, consistent with the self-scattering of thermal emission by dust particles whose maximum radius is $\approx 100~\mu m$. However, this maximum size is considerably smaller than anticipated from dust evolution models that assume a high sticking efficiency for icy particles. Here, we propose that the unexpectedly small particle size can be explained if CO$_2$ ice covers the particles in the outer region of the HL Tau disk. CO$_2$ ice is one of the most major interstellar ices, and laboratory experiments show that it is poorly sticky. Based on dust evolution models accounting for CO$_2$ ice mantles as well as aggregate sintering and post-processing radiative transfer, we simulate the polarimetric observation of HL Tau at 0.87 mm. We find that the models with CO$_2$ ice mantles better match the observation. These models also predict that only particles lying between the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ snow lines can grow to millimeter to centimeter sizes, and that their rapid inward drift results in a local dust gap similar to the 10 au gap of the HL Tau disk. We also suggest that the millimeter spectral index for the outer part of the HL Tau disk is largely controlled by the optical thickness of this region and does not necessarily indicate dust growth to millimeter sizes.","Satoshi Okuzumi, Ryo Tazaki","15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1904.03869v2,No journal ref found,Ryo Tazaki,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03869v2,2019-04-08 07:16:18+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Nonsticky Ice at the Origin of the Uniformly Polarized Submillimeter   Emission from the HL Tau Disk,2019-05-08 15:04:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03869v2
982,"NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) is one of the best targets to study AGN-feedback in the local Universe. Optical filaments located at 16 kpc from the galaxy along the radio jet direction show recent star formation, likely triggered by the interaction of the jet with an HI shell. A large reservoir of molecular gas has been discovered outside the HI. In this reservoir, lies the Horseshoe complex: a filamentary structure seen in CO with ALMA and in Halpha with MUSE. The ionised gas is mostly excited by shocks, with only a minor contribution of star formation. We used the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(3-2) and 12CO(4-3) transitions, as well as dense gas tracers in the Horseshoe complex. 12CO(3-2) and 12CO(4-3) are detected for the first time in the northern filaments of Centaurus A, with integrated intensity line ratios R32~0.2 and R43~0.1, compared to the 12CO(1-0) emission. We also derived a line ratio R21~0.6, based on the previous 12CO(2-1) observations of Salom\'e et al. (2016). We used the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and determined that the molecular gas in this region has a temperature of 55-70 K and densities between 2-6x10^2 cm^-3. Such densities are also in agreement with results from the Paris-Durham shock code that predicts a post-shock density of a few 100 cm^-3.

984,"The second $Gaia$ Data Release (DR2) contains astrometric and photometric data for more than 1.6 billion objects with mean $Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $<$20.7, including many Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in different evolutionary stages. In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined the $Gaia$ DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky probabilistic catalogue of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks. Our input catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table. We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects, main-sequence stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. To demonstrate the quality and potential of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it. (1) We explore the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with recent results from the literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify published $Gaia$ Science Alerts. As $Gaia$ measures the sources at multiple epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar disk. However, in many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources are not known.

985,"We chart a path toward solving for the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of cold dark matter by relying on a semiclassical description using the propagator. The evolution of the propagator is given by a Schr\""odinger equation, where the small parameter $\hbar$ acts as a softening scale that regulates singularities at shell-crossing. The leading-order propagator, called free propagator, is the semiclassical equivalent of the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), that describes inertial particle motion along straight trajectories. At next-to-leading order, we solve for the propagator perturbatively and obtain, in the classical limit the displacement field from second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). The associated velocity naturally includes an additional term that would be considered as third order in LPT. We show that this term is actually needed to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian structure, and ignoring it could lead to the spurious excitation of vorticity in certain implementations of second-order LPT. We show that for sufficiently small $\hbar$ the corresponding propagator solutions closely resemble LPT, with the additions that spurious vorticity is avoided and the dynamics at shell-crossing is regularised. Our analytical results possess a symplectic structure that allows us to advance numerical schemes for the large-scale structure. For times shortly after shell-crossing, we explore the generation of vorticity, which in our method does not involve any explicit multi-stream averaging, but instead arises naturally as a conserved topological charge.","Cora Uhlemann, Cornelius Rampf, Mateja Gosenca, Oliver Hahn","18 pages, added figure 6 that displays the generation of vorticity,

986,"Almost 10 yr of $\gamma$-ray observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) have revealed extreme $\gamma$-ray outbursts from flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), temporarily making these objects the brightest $\gamma$-ray emitters in the sky. Yet, the location and mechanisms of the $\gamma$-ray emission remain elusive. We characterize long-term $\gamma$-ray variability and the brightest $\gamma$-ray flares of six FSRQs. Consecutively zooming in on the brightest flares, which we identify in an objective way through Bayesian blocks and a hill-climbing algorithm, we find variability on subhour time scales and as short as minutes for two sources in our sample (3C279, CTA102) and weak evidence for variability at time scales less than the Fermi satellite's orbit of 95 minutes for PKS1510-089 and 3C454.3. This suggests extremely compact emission regions in the jet. We do not find any signs for $\gamma$-ray absorption in the broad-line region (BLR), which indicates that $\gamma$-rays are produced at distances greater than hundreds of gravitational radii from the central black hole. This is further supported by a cross-correlation analysis between $\gamma$-ray and radio/millimeter light curves, which is consistent with $\gamma$-ray production at the same location as the millimeter core for 3C273, CTA102, and 3C454.3. The inferred locations of the $\gamma$-ray production zones are still consistent with the observed decay times of the brightest flares if the decay is caused by external Compton scattering with BLR photons. However, the minute-scale variability is challenging to explain in such scenarios.","Manuel Meyer, Jeffrey D. Scargle, Roger D.

987,"The poor stickiness of silicate dust grains is a major obstacle to the formation of rocky planetesimals. In this study, we examine the possibility that silicate grains with an organic mantle, which we call Organic-Mantled Grains (OMGs), form planetesimals through direct coagulation. Organic mantles are commonly found in interplanetary dust particles, and laboratory experiments show that they are softer than silicates, in particular in warm environments. This, combined with the theory of particle adhesion, implies that OMGs are stickier than bare silicate grains. Because organic mantles can survive up to 400 K, silicate grains inside the water snow line in protoplanetary disks can in principle hold such mantles. We construct a simple grain adhesion model to estimate the threshold collision velocity below which aggregates of OMGs can grow. The model shows that aggregates of 0.1 \micron-sized OMGs can overcome the fragmentation barrier in protoplanetary disks if the mantles are as thick as those in interplanetary dust particles and if the temperature is above $\sim$ 200 K. We use this adhesion model to simulate the global evolution of OMG aggregates in the inner part of a protoplanetary disk, demonstrating that OMG aggregates can indeed grow into planetesimals under favorable conditions. Because organic matter is unstable at excessively high temperatures, rocky planetesimal formation by the direct sticking of OMGs is expected to occur in a disk annulus corresponding to the temperature range $ \sim$ 200--400 K. The organic-rich planetesimals may grow into carbon-poor rocky planetesimals by accreting a large amount of carbon-poor chondrules.","Kazuaki Homma, Satoshi Okuzumi, Taishi Nakamoto, Yuta Ueda","13 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",1905.03029v1,No journal ref found,Yuta Ueda,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03029v1,2019-05-08 12:27:00+00:00,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.EP|astro-ph.SR,Rocky Planetesimal Formation Aided by Organics,2019-05-08 12:27:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03029v1
988,"On 27 Apr 2015, when 67P/C-G was at 1.76 au from the Sun and moving towards perihelion, the OSIRIS and VIRTIS-M instruments on Rosetta observed the evolving dust and gas coma during a complete rotation of the comet. We aim to characterize the dust, H2O and CO2 gas spatial distribution in the inner coma. To do this we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas and compared the observed H2O production rate with the one calculated using a thermo-physical model. For this study we selected OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm (dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O) and 4200 nm (CO2). We measured the average signal in a circular annulus, to study spatial variation around the comet, and in a sector of the annulus, to study temporal variation in the sunward direction with comet rotation, both at a fixed distance of 3.1 km from the comet centre. The spatial correlation between dust and water, both coming from the sun-lit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver of dust activity in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not correlated with water and dust. There is no strong temporal correlation between the dust brightness and water production rate as the comet rotates. The dust brightness shows a peak at 0deg sub-solar longitude, which is not pronounced in the water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2 production. An excess of measured water production, with respect to the value calculated using a simple thermo-physical model, is observed when the head lobe and regions of the Southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations are illuminated. A drastic decrease in dust production, when the water production (both measured and from the model) displays a maximum, happens when typical Northern consolidated regions are illuminated and the Southern hemisphere regions with strong seasonal variations are instead in shadow.","C.

989,"If dark matter is composed of new particles, these may become captured after scattering with nuclei in the Sun, thermalise through additional scattering, and finally annihilate into neutrinos that can be detected on Earth. If dark matter scatters inelastically into a slightly heavier ($\mathcal{O} (10-100)$ keV) state it is unclear whether thermalisation occurs. One issue is that up-scattering from the lower mass state may be kinematically forbidden, at which point the thermalisation process effectively stops. A larger evaporation rate is also expected due to down-scattering. In this work, we perform a numerical simulation of the capture and thermalisation process in order to study the evolution of the dark matter distribution. We then calculate and compare the annihilation rate with that of the often assumed Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution. We also check if equilibrium between capture and annihilation is reached and find that this assumption definitely breaks down in a part of the explored parameter space. We also find that evaporation induced by down-scattering is not effective in reducing the total dark matter abundance.","Mattias Blennow, Stefan Clementz, Juan Herrero-Garcia","28 pages, 10 figures. v3: Errata: Bug fixed with some important

990,"Astrometry is one of the main science case which drives the requirements of the next multiconjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) systems for future extremely large telescopes. The small diffraction limited point-spread function (PSF) and the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of these instruments, promise astrometric precision at the level of micro-arcseconds. However, optical distortions have to be as low as possible to achieve the high demanding astrometry requirements. In addition to static distortions, the opto-mechanical instabilities cause astrometric errors that can be major contributors to the astrometry error budget. The present article describes the analysis, at design level, of the effects of opto-mechanical instabilities when coupled with optical surface irregularities due to the manufacturing process. We analyse the notable example of the Multi-conjugate Adaptive Optics RelaY (MAORY) for the extremely large telescope (ELT). Ray-tracing simulations combined with a Monte Carlo approach are used to estimate the geometrical structure and magnitude of field distortion resulting from the optical design. We consider the effects of distortion on the MCAO correction showing that it is possible achieve the micro-arcseconds astrometric precision once corresponding accuracy is obtained by both optical design and manufacturing. We predict that for single-epoch observations, an astrometric error below 50$\mu$as can be achieved for exposure times up to 2 min, provided about 100 stars are available to remove fifth-order distortions. Such performance could be reproducible for multi-epoch observations despite the time-variable distortion induced by instrument instabilities.","M. Patti, C. Arcidiacono, M. Lombini, E. Diolaiti, F.

991,"Dark matter (DM) particles in the Universe accumulate in neutron stars (NSs) through their interactions with ordinary matter. It has been known that their annihilation inside the NS core causes late-time heating, with which the surface temperature becomes a constant value of $T_s \simeq (2-3) \times 10^3$ K for the NS age $t \gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years. This conclusion is, however, drawn based on the assumption that the beta equilibrium is maintained in NSs throughout their life, which turns out to be invalid for rotating pulsars. The slowdown in the pulsar rotation drives the NS matter out of beta equilibrium, and the resultant imbalance in chemical potentials induces late-time heating, dubbed as rotochemical heating. This effect can heat a NS up to $T_s \simeq 10^6$ K for $t \simeq 10^{6-7}$ years. In fact, recent observations found several old NSs whose surface temperature is much higher than the prediction of the standard cooling scenario and is consistent with the rotochemical heating. Motivated by these observations, in this letter, we reevaluate the significance of the DM heating in NSs, including the effect of the rotochemical heating. We then show that the signature of DM heating can still be detected in old ordinary pulsars, while it is concealed by the rotochemical heating for old millisecond pulsars. To confirm the evidence for the DM heating, however, it is necessary to improve our knowledge on nucleon pairing gaps as well as to evaluate the initial period of the pulsars accurately. In any cases, a discovery of a very cold NS can give a robust constraint on the DM heating, and thus on DM models. To demonstrate this, as an example, we also discuss the case that the DM is the neutral component of an electroweak multiplet, and show that an observation of a NS with $T_s \lesssim 10^3$ K imposes a stringent constraint on such a DM candidate.","Koichi Hamaguchi, Natsumi Nagata, Keisuke Yanagi","7 pages, 3 figures",1905.02991v1,No journal ref found,Keisuke Yanagi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02991v1,2019-05-08 10:09:25+00:00,hep-ph,hep-ph|astro-ph.HE,Dark Matter Heating vs. Rotochemical Heating in Old Neutron Stars,2019-05-08 10:09:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02991v1
992,"Dispersive delays due to the Solar wind introduce excess noise in high-precision pulsar timing experiments, and must be removed in order to achieve the accuracy needed to detect, e.g., low-frequency gravitational waves. In current pulsar timing experiments, this delay is usually removed by approximating the electron density distribution in the Solar wind either as spherically symmetric, or with a two-phase model that describes the contributions from both high- and low-speed phases of the Solar wind. However, no dataset has previously been available to test the performance and limitations of these models over extended timescales and with sufficient sensitivity. Here we present the results of such a test with an optimal dataset of observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations of LOFAR. We conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better than the two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a residual root-mean-square (rms) given by the two-phase model being up to 28% larger than the result obtained with the spherical approximation. Nevertheless, the spherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the Solar-wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the Sun), as it leaves timing residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent of 0.3 microseconds at 1400 MHz. This is because a spherical model ignores the large daily variations in electron density observed in the Solar wind. In the short term, broadband observations or simultaneous observations at low frequencies are the most promising way forward to correct for Solar-wind induced delay variations.","C. Tiburzi, J. P. W.

993,"The Cassini spacecraft made a gravity assist flyby of Jupiter in December 2000. The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) acquired images of the planet that covered the visual range with filters sensitive to the distribution of clouds and hazes, their altitudes and color. We use a selection of these images to build high-resolution cylindrical maps of the planet in 9 wavelengths. We explore the spatial distribution of the planet reflectivity examining the distribution of color and altitudes of hazes as well as their relation. A variety of analyses is presented: a) Principal Component Analysis (PCA); b) color-altitude indices; and c) chromaticity diagrams (for a quantitative characterization of Jupiter ""true"" colors as they would be perceived by a human observer). PCA of the full dataset indicates that six components are required to explain the data.

994,"We investigate the effect of the cuspiness of scalar potentials on the production of gravitational waves during oscillon formation after inflation. We consider a more general form of potentials with a mass parameter $M$, which repoduce cuspy potentials for fields much larger than $M$, and smooth potentials in the opposite limit. For cuspy potentials, nonsmooth oscillations of the inflaton induce an amplification of the inflaton fluctuations at the bottom of the potential, so that oscillons copiously form, which leads to a significant stochastic gravitational wave background with a double-peak spectrum. By varying the parameter $M$, we find that cuspy potentials yield stronger signals of gravitational waves and the generation of gravitational waves disappears for smooth potentials. Moreover, we calculate the equation of state after inflation and find the presence of a quasi matter-dominated stage right before the transition to the radiation-dominated stage.","Jing Liu, Zong-Kuan Guo, Rong-Gen Cai, Gary Shiu","13 pages, 9 figures",1812.09235v2,No journal ref found,Gary Shiu,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09235v2,2018-12-20 07:45:00+00:00,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.CO|gr-qc|hep-ph,Gravitational wave production after inflation with cuspy potentials,2019-05-08 09:33:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09235v2
995,"We study the properties of photochemical hazes in super-Earths/mini-Neptunes atmospheres with particular focus on GJ1214b. We evaluate photochemical haze properties at different metallicities between solar and 10000$\times$solar. Within the four orders of magnitude change in metallicity, we find that the haze precursor mass fluxes change only by a factor of $\sim$3. This small diversity occurs with a non-monotonic manner among the different metallicity cases, reflecting the interaction of the main atmospheric gases with the radiation field. Comparison with relative haze yields at different metallicities from laboratory experiments reveals a qualitative similarity with our theoretical calculations and highlights the contributions of different gas precursors. Our haze simulations demonstrate that higher metallicity results into smaller average particle sizes. Metallicities at and above 100$\times$solar with haze formation yields of $\sim$10$\%$ provide enough haze opacity to satisfy transit observation at visible wavelengths and obscure sufficiently the H$_2$O molecular absorption features between 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.7 $\mu$m. However, only the highest metallicity case considered (10000$\times$solar) brings the simulated spectra into closer agreement with transit depths at 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m indicating a high contribution of CO/CO$_2$ in GJ1214b's atmosphere. We also evaluate the impact of aggregate growth in our simulations, in contrast to spherical growth, and find that the two growth modes provide similar transit signatures (for D$_f$=2), but with different particle size distributions. Finally, we conclude that the simulated haze particles should have major implications for the atmospheric thermal structure and for the properties of condensation clouds.","Panayotis Lavvas, Tommi Koskinen, Maria Steinrueck, Antonio GarcÃ­a MuÃ±oz, Adam P.

996,"We report an analysis of the metal-rich tail ([Fe/H] $> -0.75$) of halo stars located at distances from the Galactic plane $z$ up to $|z| \sim 10$ kpc, observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We examine the chemistry, kinematics, and dynamics of this metal-rich halo sample using chemical abundances and radial velocities provided by the fourteenth APOGEE data release (DR14) and proper motions from the second Gaia data release (DR2). The analysis reveals three chemically different stellar populations in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space -- the two distinct halo populations already reported in the literature, and a third group with intermediate [Mg/Fe] $\sim$+0.1. We derive the $U$, $V$ and $W$ velocity components with respect to the Local Standard of Rest, as well as orbits for the three stellar groups, and find that they differ also in their kinematical and dynamical properties. The high-[Mg/Fe] population exhibits a mean prograde rotation, as well as orbits that are more bound and closer to the plane, whereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $<V>$ closer to 0, and stars that move in less-bound orbits reaching larger distances from the centre and the Galactic plane. The intermediate-Mg stars exhibit different orbital characteristics, moving with a strong prograde rotation and low excentricity, but in less-bound orbits. This stellar population resembles the two stellar overdensities lying about $|z| \sim 5$ kpc recently reported in the literature, for which a disc origin has been claimed.","Emma FernÃ¡ndez-Alvar, J.

997,"We investigate metal pollution onto the surface of low-mass population III stars (Pop. III survivors) via interstellar objects floating in the Galactic interstellar medium. Only recently, Tanikawa et al. analytically estimated how much metal should collide to an orbiting Pop. III survivor encouraged by the recent discovery of 'Oumuamua and suggested that ISOs are the most dominant contributor of metal enrichment of Pop. III survivors. When we consider a distribution of interstellar objects in the Galactic disc, Pop. III survivors' orbits are significant properties to estimate the accretion rate of them though Tanikawa et al. assumed one modelled orbit. To take more realistic orbits into calculating the accretion rate, we use a high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation that resolves dark matter minihaloes. Pop. III survivors located at solar neighbourhood have a number of chances of ISO($> 100$ m) collisions, typically $5\times10^6$ times in the last $5$ Gyr, which is one order of magnitude greater than estimated in the previous study. When we assume a power-law parameter $\alpha$ of the ISO cumulative number density with size greater than $D$ as $n \propto D^{-\alpha}$, $0.80 \, M_{\odot}$ stars should be typically polluted [Fe/H]$\sim -2$ for the case of $\alpha=2.0$. Even in the cases of $0.70$ and $0.75 \, M_{\odot}$ stars, the typical surface metallicity are around [Fe/H]$=-6 \sim -5$. From the presence of stars with their [Fe/H], we can constrain on the lower limit of the power $\alpha$, as $\alpha \gtrsim 2.0$, which is consistent with $\alpha$ of km-size asteroids and comets in the solar system. Furthermore, we provide six candidates as the ISO-polluted Pop. III stars in the case of $\alpha \sim 2.5$. Metal-poor stars so far discovered are possible to be metal-free Pop.

This sample widely spans the star-forming Main Sequence (MS), having $10^{8} \leqslant M_{\star} \leqslant 10^{11.5} \ M_{\odot}$ and $20 \leqslant SFR \leqslant 680 \ M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$.

These compact galaxies have instead normally extended $K_{band}$ sizes, suggesting strong specific $SFR$ gradients. Compact galaxies comprise the $50\pm18 \%$ of MS galaxies at $M_{\star} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. This is not expected in standard bi-modal scenarios where MS galaxies are mostly steadily-growing extended disks. We suggest that compact MS objects are early post-starburst galaxies in which the merger-driven boost of SF has subsided. They retain their compact SF size until either further gas accretion restores pre-merger galaxy-wide SF, or until becoming quenched. The fraction of merger-affected SF inside the MS seems thus larger than anticipated and might reach $\sim 50$\% at the highest $M_{\star}$.

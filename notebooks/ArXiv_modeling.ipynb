      "Modeling solar coronal bright point oscillations with multiple nanoflare   heated loops \n",
      "\n",
      "Intensity oscillations of coronal bright points (BPs) have been studied for past several years. It has been known for a while that these BPs are closed magnetic loop like structures. However, initiation of such intensity oscillations is still an enigma. There have been many suggestions to explain these oscillations, but modeling of such BPs have not been explored so far. Using a multithreaded nanoflare heated loop model we study the behavior of such BPs in this work. We compute typical loop lengths of BPs using potential field line extrapolation of available data (Chandrashekhar et al. 2013), and set this as the length of our simulated loops. We produce intensity like observables through forward modeling and analyze the intensity time series using wavelet analysis, as was done by previous observers. The result reveals similar intensity oscillation periods reported in past observations. It is suggested these oscillations are actually shock wave propagations along the loop. We also show that if one considers different background subtractions, one can extract adiabatic standing modes from the intensity time series data as well, both from the observed and simulated data. \n",

      "First Imaging Observation of Standing Slow Wave in Coronal Fan loops \n",
      "\n",
      "We observe intensity oscillations along coronal fan loops associated with the active region AR 11428. The intensity oscillations were triggered by blast waves which were generated due to X-class flares in the distant active region AR 11429. To characterise the nature of oscillations, we created time-distance maps along the fan loops and noted that the intensity oscillations at two ends of the loops were out of phase. As we move along the fan loop, the amplitude of the oscillations first decreased and then increased. The out-of-phase nature together with the amplitude variation along the loop implies that these oscillations are very likely to be standing waves. The period of the oscillations are estimated to be $\\sim$27 min, damping time to be $\\sim$45 min and phase velocity projected in the plane of sky $\\sim$ 65-83 km s$^{-1}$. The projected phase speeds were in the range of acoustic speed of coronal plasma at about 0.6 MK which further indicates that these are slow waves. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the existence of the standing slow waves in non-flaring fan loops. \n",
